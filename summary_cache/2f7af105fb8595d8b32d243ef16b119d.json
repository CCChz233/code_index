Requirements: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English). So we need to produce a summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). The code is a method `plot` inside a class `Spectrum` (presumably). It uses matplotlib to plot a mass spectrum and optionally a histogram of intensities, and optionally an exponential decay fit on the histogram.\n\nWe need to summarize inputs: intensity_from, intensity_to, with_histogram, with_expfit. Also uses self.peaks (with mz and intensities). Output: a matplotlib Figure object.\n\nBusiness logic: compute intensity range, set default intensity_to if None, set number of bins, create figure, plot spectrum as stems, optionally plot histogram of intensities, optionally fit exponential decay to histogram counts and overlay fit line. Also includes validation: if with_expfit True, with_histogram must be True.\n\nWe need to mention internal functions: plot_histogram, plot_spectrum, calc_bin_edges_intensity, exponential_decay_function, plot_expfit, make_stems. But summary can be high-level.\n\nLet's produce a concise Chinese summary with bullet points.\n\nMake sure not to start with \"This code", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:39:18.465516"}
