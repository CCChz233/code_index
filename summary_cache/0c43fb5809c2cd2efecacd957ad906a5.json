{"summary": "We have a Python module `modin/polars/series.py` that defines a `Series` class (presumably extending Modin's Polars integration). The code imports various modules, including `numpy`, `pandas`, `polars`, and Modin components. It defines some global variables (`_sorted`, `_descending`, `flags`, etc.) and a method `rolling_var` within the `Series` class.\n\nThe `rolling_var` method:\n- Takes a window size (int), optional weights (list of float), min_periodic (int), and optional keyword arguments `center` (bool), `ddof\u00a0\u00a0\u200b\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u200b\u00a0\u00a0...` etc.\n- It **\u00a0\u00a0...** ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... \nWe need to produce a summary of the functionality of the code. The code snippet is incomplete; we have only part of the file. It defines a Series class? Actually the snippet shows:\n\n```\nmodin/polars/series.py Series from __future__ import annotations from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, Sequence import numpy as np import pandas import polars from polars._utils.various import no_default from modin.core.storage_formats.base.query_compiler import BaseQueryCompiler from modin.error_message import ErrorMessage from modin.pandas import Series as ModinPandasSeries from modin.pandas.io import from_pandas from modin.polars.base import BasePolarsDataset _sorted = False _descending = None flags = [] has_validity = has_nulls rename = alias     def rolling_var(\n        self,\n        window_size: int,\n        ...\n```\n\nIt seems the code is truncated. The summary should focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. The method rolling_var applies a rolling variance calculation using pandas rolling then var. It returns a new Series constructed via self.__constructor__.\n\nThus the summary: The module provides a Series class for Modin's Polars integration. It includes a rolling_var method that computes rolling variance over a window, optionally with min_periods, centering, and degrees of freedom. It currently does not support weighted variance. It converts the underlying data to pandas, uses pandas rolling and var, then wraps the result back into a Series.\n\nAlso there are some global flags but not used.\n\nThus produce Chinese summary.\n\nLet's craft.\n\nWe need to start directly with summary content, no preamble.
