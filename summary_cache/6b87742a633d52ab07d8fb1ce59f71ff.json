{"summary": "The code defines a module for handling wave audio files. It imports necessary modules and defines constants for wave format types. It also defines a named tuple `_wave_params` to store wave file parameters such as number of channels, sample width, frame rate, number of frames, compression type, and compression name. The `getmarkers` function returns `None`. The module also includes a `Wave_write` class (not shown) and `open` function (which may be used to open a wave file). The code also defines a `Error` class.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. They gave a snippet of code from Lib/wave.py. The code includes imports, __all__, constants, a namedtuple, and a getmarkers method returning None. The user wants a summary focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs, in Chinese (or Chinese/English). They also want to start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms.\n\nWe need to mention that the module provides wave file handling, defines constants for PCM and extensible formats, defines a namedtuple for wave parameters, includes a getmarkers method returning None, and defines __all__ for exported symbols. Also mention that Wave_write class and open function are part of the module (though not shown). The business logic: reading/writing wave files, handling parameters, error handling.\n\nWe need to avoid \"This code does...\" and start directly with the summary. So start with something like:\n\n\"\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9 WAV \u97f3\u9891\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u8bfb\u5199\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86 PCM \u4e0e Extensible \u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u5e38\u91cf\u3001\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u6ce2\u5f62\u53c2\u6570\u7684 `_wave_params` \u547d\u540d\u5143\u7ec4\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca `getmarkers` \u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd4\u56de `None`\u3002\u6a21\u5757\u5bfc\u51fa `open`, `Error`, `Wave_read`, `Wave_write`\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u5907\u4e86 `Wave_write` \u7c7b\u548c `open` \u51fd\u6570\u7528\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\u6216\u6253\u5f00 WAV \u6587\u4ef6\u3002\"\n\nMake sure to mention inputs/outputs: inputs are wave file objects, parameters; outputs are wave file objects, parameters, errors.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9 WAV \u97f3\u9891\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u8bfb\u5199\u652f\u6301\u3002  \n- **\u5e38\u91cf\u5b9a\u4e49**\uff1a`WAVE_FORMAT_PCM`\u3001`WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` \u8868\u793a PCM \u4e0e Extensible \u7f16\u7801\u683c\u5f0f\uff1b`KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_PCM` \u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684 GUID\u3002", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:53:00.128534"}
