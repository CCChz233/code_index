{"summary": "The code defines a comprehensive client library for asynchronous HTTP requests using aiohttp. It includes a `ClientSession` class that manages HTTP connections, handles cookies, authentication, and request/response processing. The library supports various HTTP methods, WebSocket communication, and provides extensive error handling through custom exceptions. It also includes utilities for timeout management, proxy configuration, and tracing. The `ClientSession` class offers methods to send requests, manage sessions, and handle responses, with support for automatic decompression, JSON serialization, and charset resolution. The module exports key classes and functions for external use, such as `ClientSession`, `ClientTimeout`, and `request`. The code also defines default configurations like timeout settings and idempotent HTTP methods.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. They gave a large code snippet from aiohttp/client.py. They want the summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English). They gave requirements: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English). So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). Should mention that it's an async HTTP client library, the main class is ClientSession, handles requests, responses, websockets, cookies, auth, timeouts, proxies, tracing, etc. Input: URL, method, headers, data, json, etc. Output: ClientResponse or ClientWebSocketResponse. Also mention default timeout, idempotent methods, error handling via exceptions. Also mention exported symbols.\n\nWe need to start directly with the summary content, no preamble. So start with something like:\n\n\"\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e aiohttp \u7684\u5f02\u6b65 HTTP \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e93\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u7c7b `ClientSession`...\"\n\nMake sure not to start with \"This code does...\" etc. Provide Chinese summary. Possibly include some English terms for class names.\n\nLet's craft a concise but thorough summary. Also mention that the module defines default timeout, idempotent methods, etc.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e **aiohttp** \u7684\u5f02\u6b65 HTTP \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e93\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e3a **ClientSession**\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23\u7ba1\u7406\u6574\u4e2a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u6c60\u3001Cookie\u3001\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3001\u8bf7\u6c42/\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e0e\u89e3\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u3002\n\n**\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91**  \n- \u901a\u8fc7 **ClientSession** \u53d1\u8d77 HTTP \u8bf7\u6c42\uff08GET\u3001POST\u3001PUT\u3001DELETE\u3001HEAD", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:46:17.711608"}
