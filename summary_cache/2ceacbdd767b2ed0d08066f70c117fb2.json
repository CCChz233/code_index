The snippet is from instructor/client.py. It imports many modules, defines types, variables, and a method clear in a class (presumably). The snippet is incomplete; we have only part of the file. We need to summarize business logic, inputs, outputs.\n\nLet's examine snippet:\n\n```\ninstructor/client.py Instructor from __future__ import annotations import openai import inspect import instructor from .utils import Provider, get_provider from openai.types.chat import ChatCompletionMessageParam from typing import (     TypeVar,     Callable,     overload,     Union,     Literal,     Any, ) from tenacity import (     AsyncRetrying,     Retrying, ) from collections.abc import Generator, Iterable, Awaitable, AsyncGenerator from typing_extensions import Self from pydantic import BaseModel from instructor.dsl.partial import Partial from instructor.hooks import Hooks, HookName T = TypeVar(\"T\", bound=Union[BaseModel, \"Iterable[Any]\", \"Partial[Any]\"]) client: Any | None create_fn: Callable[..., Any] mode: instructor.Mode default_model: str | None = None provider: Provider hooks: Hooks     def clear(\n        self,\n        hook_name: (\n            HookName\n            | Literal[\n                \"completion:kwargs\",\n                \"completion:response\",\n                \"completion:error\",\n                \"completion:last_attempt\",\n                \"parse:error\",\n            ]\n        )\n        | None = None,\n    ) -> None:\n        self.hooks.clear(hook_name)\n```\n\nSo the code defines a client class (maybe Instructor) that wraps OpenAI API calls with additional features: provider abstraction, retry logic via tenacity, hooks for lifecycle events, partial DSL for building prompts, etc. The clear method clears registered hooks for a given hook name or all.\n\nWe need to summarize functionality: It sets up a client for interacting with OpenAI's chat completion API, supports synchronous and asynchronous calls, uses provider to select model, supports retry, supports hooks for customizing behavior at various stages (completion kwargs, response, error, last attempt, parse error). The clear method resets hooks.\n\nInputs: hook_name optional string literal or HookName enum; output: None.\n\nAlso there are global variables: client, create_fn, mode, default_model, provider, hooks.\n\nThus summary: The module defines a client wrapper that abstracts OpenAI", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:34:48.024253"}
