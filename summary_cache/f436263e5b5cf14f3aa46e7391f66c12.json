{"summary": "- Provides utility functions and classes for aiohttp library.\n- Handles authentication (BasicAuth), cookie handling, and HTTP headers.\n- Defines various constants, regex patterns, and helper functions for parsing.\n- Includes a `BasicAuth` class for encoding credentials.\n- Includes `ChainMapProxy` and `ETag` classes.\n- Provides `reify` (under_cached_property) re-typed.\n- \nWe need to summarize functionality of the code snippet. The code is from aiohttp/helpers.py. It imports many modules, defines constants, regexes, etc. The snippet includes __all__, constants like COOKIE_MAX_LENGTH, sentinel, etc. Also defines a class with __slots__ and __orig_class__? Actually at bottom there is a class definition with __slots__ = (\"_name\", \"_t\", \"__orig_class__\") and __orig_class__: Type[object] def __init__(self, name: str, t: Optional[Type[_T]] = None): ... This appears to be a generic class for something like \"CacheKey\"? Not sure. But the snippet ends there.\n\nWe need to summarize business logic, inputs, outputs. The code defines utilities for aiohttp: authentication, cookie handling, header parsing, ETag handling, etc. It defines constants for empty body status codes, methods, debug flag, character sets for token validation, regex for JSON content types, etc. It also defines a sentinel enum for sentinel values. It defines a class (maybe \"CacheKey\" or \"Key\") that constructs a unique name based on module name and given name, used for caching.\n\nThus summary: The module provides helper utilities for aiohttp: BasicAuth for HTTP Basic authentication encoding; ChainMapProxy for read-only view of multiple mappings; ETag parsing and handling; reify property decorator; constants for HTTP behavior; regex patterns for content type detection; functions for date formatting, cookie parsing, etc. Input: various parameters like username/password for BasicAuth, header strings for ETag parsing, etc. Output: encoded auth header, parsed ETag objects, etc.\n\nLet's craft Chinese summary focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs. Mention that the code defines constants, regex, utility functions, and classes used throughout aiohttp for handling HTTP specifics.\n\nWill produce concise summary.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b aiohttp \u6846\u67b6\u5185\u90e8\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u5408\u3002  \n\n**\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91**  \n- **BasicAuth**\uff1a\u63a5\u53d7 `username`\u3001`password`\uff08\u53ef\u9009 `encoding`\uff09\uff0c", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:42:14.247693"}
