{"summary": "The test verifies that the `openai_schema` decorator enforces its target class to inherit from `pydantic.BaseModel`. It attempts to apply the decorator to a plain class `Dummy` (which does not subclass `BaseModel`). The test expects a `TypeError` with a specific message (\"must be a subclass ...\") to be raised, confirming the decorator's validation logic.
