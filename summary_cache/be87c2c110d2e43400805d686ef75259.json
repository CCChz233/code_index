{"summary": "The script defines a ****?**?**... etc...\n\nThe script defines a command-line tool for checking documentation consistency in a Python project, specifically targeting the Modin repository. It validates docstrings against NumPy documentation standards and custom Modin-specific rules. The tool accepts file paths as input, verifies their existence and ensures they belong to the Modin repository. It raises errors for missing files or paths outside the repository. The script uses environment variables, logging, and external libraries like `numpydoc` for parsing and validating docstrings. It also defines custom error codes for Modin-specific documentation issues, such as parameter description format, spelling errors, and indentation problems.\n\n```python\ndef function_name():\n``\n\nThe provided code snippet defines a Python function named `function_name` without any parameters or implementation.
