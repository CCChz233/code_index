{"summary": "- The test imports various LLM libraries (cohere, openai, anthropic) and testing utilities (pytest, pydantic).\n- It defines a test function `test_client_chat_completions_create` that:\n  - Instantiates a client using `instructor.from_openai` with the OpenAI API.\n  - Calls `client.chat.completions.create` to generate a user model (from `User` pydantic) based on a prompt.\n  - Asserts that the generated output **\u200b**.\nWe need to produce a summary of the functionality of the code, focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs, in Chinese (or Chinese/English). Must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". So start with something like:\n\n\"\u529f\u80fd\u6982\u8ff0\uff1a...\". Provide summary.\n\nThe code is a test file for LLM client. It imports libraries, defines a test function that creates a client from OpenAI using instructor wrapper, sends a chat completion request with a prompt \"Jason is 10\", expects response model User (which is not defined in snippet but presumably a Pydantic model with fields name and age). Then asserts that user.name == \"Jason\" and user.age == 10.\n\nSo business logic: test that the client can parse chat completion into a Pydantic model.\n\nInputs: openai client, model name \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", messages list with role user and content \"Jason is 10\", temperature 0, response_model=User.\n\nOutputs: a User instance with name and age extracted from the LLM response; test asserts those values.\n\nWe can mention that the test ensures the integration of instructor library with OpenAI to map LLM output to structured data.\n\nNow produce summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u529f\u80fd\u6982\u8ff0  \n- \u901a\u8fc7 `instructor.from_openai` \u5305\u88c5 OpenAI \u7684 `openai.OpenAI()` \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fd4\u56de\u7684 LLM \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u3002  \n- \u8c03\u7528 `client.chat.completions.create`\uff0c\u5411\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u9ed8\u8ba4 `gpt-3.5-turbo`\uff09\u53d1\u9001\u5355\u6761\u7528\u6237\u6d88\u606f `{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Jason is 10\"}`\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5b9a `response_model=User`\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ee7\u627f\u81ea Pydantic \u7684\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b `name` \u4e0e `age` \u5b57\u6bb5\uff09\uff0c`temperature=0`", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T21:00:15.622376"}
