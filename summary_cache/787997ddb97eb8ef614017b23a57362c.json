{"summary": "We have a code snippet from a file `matchms/filtering/SpeciesString.py` containing a class `SpeciesString`. It imports `re` (regular expressions). The class has an __init__ method that takes a string `dirty` (the raw input). It stores the `dirty` string, then initializes `target` and `cleaned` attributes to None. Then it calls `guess_target()` and `clean()`. The code is incomplete; we only see the __init__ method. The class likely processes a species name string, possibly extracting a target species name and cleaning it (e.g., removing extra characters etc.). The summary should be:\n\nWe need to summaratically summarise the **?**.\n\nWe need to write a summary.\n\nWe need to focus on business logic: The class takes a raw species string, guesses the target species name, and cleans it. It uses regular expressions. The output is stored in attributes `target` and `cleaned`. The code snippet only shows the __init__ method.\n\nWe need to produce a summary.\n\nThus, answer: ...\"\n\nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese.\n\nWe need to start directly with the summary content.

The code snippet is a class SpeciesString with __init__ that takes a dirty string, sets attributes, calls guess_target() and clean(). So the business logic: It processes a raw species string, attempts to infer the target species name, and cleans the string. Input: dirty string. Output: attributes target and cleaned.\n\nThus answer: \"\u63a5\u6536\u539f\u59cb\u7269\u79cd\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u63a8\u65ad\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u79cd\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6e05\u6d17\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4fdd\u5b58\u5728target\u548ccleaned\u5c5e\u6027\u4e2d\u3002\" Probably also mention uses regex.
