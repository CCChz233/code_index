{"summary": "- The code defines a module for handling WAV audio files, providing functions to open, read, and write WAV files.\n- It defines a `Wave_read` class that contains a `readframes` method.\n- The `readframes` method reads a specified number of frames (the `nframes``) from the `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````... (truncated).\"\n\nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English). Must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" etc. So we need to summarize the functionality: It's a module for handling WAV files, defines open, Error, Wave_read, Wave_write, constants, namedtuple for parameters, readframes method reads frames, handles seeking, byte swapping for big-endian, conversion, updates position, returns data.\n\nWe need to mention inputs: nframes, internal state like _data_chunk, _soundpos, _framesize, _sampwidth, _nchannels, _convert. Output: bytes of audio data.\n\nAlso mention business logic: reading audio frames, handling data chunk seeking, byte order conversion, optional conversion function.\n\nWe can also mention that the module defines constants for PCM format, extensible format, and a GUID for PCM subtype.\n\nWe can mention that __all__ includes open, Error, Wave_read, Wave_write.\n\nWe can mention that _array_fmts maps sample width to array type codes.\n\nWe can mention that _wave_params is a namedtuple for wave parameters.\n\nWe need to keep it concise but cover the main points.\n\nLet's produce a Chinese summary, maybe with some English terms for clarity.\n\nMake sure not to start with \"This code...\" etc. Just start with the summary.\n\nOk.assistantfinal\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9 WAV \u97f3\u9891\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u6253\u5f00\u3001\u8bfb\u53d6\u548c\u5199\u5165\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u7c7b\u4e3a **Wave_read**\uff0c\u5176\u5173\u952e\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n- **\u5e38\u91cf\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784**\uff1a\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86 PCM\uff08`WAVE_FORMAT_PCM`\uff09\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u683c\u5f0f\uff08`WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE`\uff09\u7684\u6807\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca PCM \u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u7684 GUID\uff08`KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_PCM`\uff09\u3002`_wave_params`", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:51:37.203840"}
