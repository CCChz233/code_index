They gave requirements: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English). The assistant already gave a summary. But we need to improve? The user gave a prompt: \"Summarize the functionality of the following code.\" The assistant responded with a summary. But maybe they want a better summary? The assistant's summary includes bullet points. It meets requirements: starts directly with summary content, no \"This code does...\". It uses Chinese and English. It focuses on business logic, inputs, outputs. It seems fine. However, we might need to include that `User` model is not defined in snippet but presumably a Pydantic model. Also mention that the test uses pytest. Provide more detail about the test's purpose: verifying that the iterable returns two user objects. Also mention that the test imports other libraries but not used. Provide final answer. Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal- \u4f7f\u7528 `instructor` \u5305\u88c5 OpenAI \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u8fd4\u56de\u7b26\u5408 Pydantic `BaseModel`\uff08\u6b64\u5904\u4e3a `User`\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002  \n- \u8c03\u7528 `client.chat.completions.create_iterable`\uff0c\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u9001\u5355\u6761\u6d88\u606f `{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Alice is 25, Bob is 30\"}`\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5b9a `response_model=User`\u3001`temperature=0`\u3002  \n- \u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd4\u56de\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8fed\u4ee3\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u9010\u6761\u751f\u6210 `User` \u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u5176\u904d\u5386\u5e76\u6536\u96c6\u5230\u5217\u8868 `users` \u4e2d", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T21:00:23.629750"}
