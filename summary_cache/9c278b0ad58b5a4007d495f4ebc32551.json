{"summary": "- The script defines a CLI tool using Typer for monitoring OpenAI fine-tuning jobs.\n- It imports necessary modules, including OpenAI client, typer, and rich.\n- The `generate_table` function creates a table with a list of fine-tuned \n```\"\n\nThe user wants a summary of the code's functionality, focusing on business logic, inputs, and outputs, in Chinese (or Chinese/English). The summary must start directly with the content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". So we need to start with a sentence summarizing the functionality, not prefixed with \"This code does\". Also we need to mention business logic, inputs, outputs.\n\nThe code snippet is incomplete; it ends with \"Summary:\" and then bullet points. The user likely expects the assistant to produce a summary. The code defines a CLI tool for monitoring OpenAI fine-tuning jobs, using Typer and Rich. It defines a function generate_table that takes a list of FineTuningJob objects and returns a Rich Table with job details, sorted by creation time. It uses OpenAI client to fetch jobs (though not shown). The CLI likely has commands to list jobs and refresh every 5 seconds.\n\nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English). Let's produce Chinese summary with some English terms.\n\nWe must not start with \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". So start directly: \"\u8be5\u811a\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86...\" etc.\n\nLet's produce a concise summary: business logic: monitor fine-tuning jobs, display status, refresh. Input: list of FineTuningJob objects (or fetched from OpenAI API). Output: Rich Table printed to console, auto-refresh.\n\nAlso mention that the CLI uses Typer, OpenAI client, Rich Live for auto-refresh.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u8be5\u811a\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e Typer \u7684\u547d\u4ee4\u884c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7 OpenAI \u5fae\u8c03\u4f5c\u4e1a\uff08Fine\u2011Tuning Job\uff09\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n- **\u8f93\u5165**\uff1a\u4ece OpenAI API \u83b7\u53d6\u7684 `list[FineTuningJob]` \u5bf9\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\uff08\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u5305\u542b\u4f5c\u4e1a ID\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u521b\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u540d\u79f0\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u4ef6 ID\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3002\n- **\u5904\u7406**\uff1a`generate_table` \u51fd\u6570\u5148\u6309 `created_at` \u964d\u5e8f\u6392\u5e8f\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u904d\u5386\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f5c\u4e1a\uff0c\u6839\u636e `status` \u6620\u5c04\u76f8\u5e94\u7684 Emoji \u4e0e\u989c\u8272", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:55:42.848207"}
