Summarize the functionality of the following code. Requirements: 1. Start directly with the summary content. No \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". 2. Focus on the business logic, inputs, and outputs. 3. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English).\"\n\nThey provided code and a summary already. The assistant responded with a summary. But the user might be expecting a revised summary? Actually the user gave the code and then a \"Summary:\" they wrote. The assistant responded with that summary. But maybe they want a better summary? The instruction says \"Summarize the functionality of the following code.\" The assistant gave a summary. That seems correct. However maybe they want a more detailed summary focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs. The code is a test that checks is_async detection. The summary should start directly with content, no preamble. Should be Chinese. The assistant's summary is Chinese and meets requirements. But maybe they want to include inputs and outputs: input is triple_wrapped_function, output is boolean True. Business logic: test is_async detection across wrappers.\n\nThus we can provide a refined summary. Let's produce a concise Chinese summary: \"\u9a8c\u8bc1 is_async \u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u5c42 functools.wraps \u5305\u88c5\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u4e3a triple_wrapped_function\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u4e3a True\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u51fd\u6570\u4ecd\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5f02\u6b65\u3002\" Ensure no preamble.
