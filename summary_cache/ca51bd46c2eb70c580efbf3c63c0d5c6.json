They gave a snippet of code from aiohttp/payload.py. The code includes imports, definitions, and a class Payload with content_type property. The user wants a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English). They want to start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese.\n\nWe need to produce a concise summary of the module's functionality: handling HTTP payloads, various payload types, registry, get_payload function, etc. The snippet is incomplete but we can infer the overall module.\n\nWe should mention that the module defines a registry for payload types, functions to get appropriate payload class based on input, and various concrete payload classes for bytes, strings, file-like objects, JSON, async iterables, etc. It also defines default content type, size limit, and provides methods to compute content length, content type, and to write payload to a stream writer.\n\nWe need to mention inputs: various Python objects (bytes, str, IOBase, JSON-serializable, async iterables). Outputs: a Payload instance that can be used by aiohttp to send HTTP request/response bodies, with appropriate headers (Content-Type, Content-Length, Content-Disposition). Also mention that the module uses content disposition header for file uploads, guess filename, parse mimetype, etc.\n\nWe need to start directly with the summary content, no preamble.\n\nLet's produce a Chinese summary, maybe with some English terms for class names.\n\nLet's do it.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u5957\u7edf\u4e00\u7684 **HTTP payload** \u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n1. **Payload \u6ce8\u518c\u8868**  \n   - `PAYLOAD_REGISTRY`\uff08`PayloadRegistry` \u5b9e\u4f8b\uff09\u7ef4\u62a4 **type \u2192 Payload \u5b50\u7c7b** \u7684\u6620\u5c04\u3002  \n   - `payload_type` \u88c5\u9970\u5668\u5728\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u628a\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684 Python \u7c7b\u578b\u6ce8\u518c\u5230\u8868\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f9b\u540e\u7eed **\u81ea\u52a8", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:52:56.811792"}
