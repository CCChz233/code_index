{"summary": "The code defines a comprehensive client session module for asynchronous HTTP requests using aiohttp. It imports necessary libraries and modules, defines various exception classes, request/response handling classes, connector types, cookie management, and helper functions. The module provides a `ClientSession` class with numerous attributes and methods for managing HTTP connections, handling authentication, timeouts, redirects, and tracing. It also includes functionality for WebSocket communication and supports various connection types (TCP, Unix, NamedPipe). The `detach` method allows detaching the connector from the session without closing it, marking the session as closed. Inputs include URLs, request parameters, and optional configurations; outputs are HTTP responses or WebSocket responses, with error handling for various failure scenarios.", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:46:38.914358"}
