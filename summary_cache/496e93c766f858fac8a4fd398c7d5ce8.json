{"summary": "- The code defines a function `initialize_retrying` that sets up a retry mechanism for handling failures in either synchronous or asynchronous operations.\n- Input parameters:\n  - `max_retries`: can be an integer specifying the maximum number of retry attempts, or an existing `Retrying`/`AsyncRetrying` object from the tenacity library.\n  - `is_async` (bool): indicates whether the retry logic should be configured for asynchronous execution.\n- The function validates the type of `max_retries`. If it's an integer, it creates a new `Retrying` (for sync) or `AsyncRetrying` (for async) instance with a stop condition after the specified number of attempts.\n- If `max_retries` is already a `Retrying` or `AsyncRetrying` object, it is returned unchanged.\n- If the input type is invalid, a `ValueError` is raised.\n- The function returns a configured `retrying` object that can be used to wrap\u00a0the\u00a0... (unfinished).\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. They gave a snippet of code from instructor/retry.py. The code includes imports, logger, type variables, and a function initialize_retrying. The user wants a summary focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs, in Chinese (or Chinese/English). Must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). Should mention that the function sets up retry mechanism using tenacity, handling sync/async, input validation, returns a Retrying or AsyncRetrying object, raises ValueError for invalid type.\n\nWe should also mention that the code imports many modules but the core function is initialize_retrying. The summary should be about the business logic: establishing retry policy for API calls (likely for OpenAI). Provide inputs: max_retries (int or Retrying/AsyncRetrying), is_async flag. Output: configured retry object.\n\nWe need to follow the requirements: start directly with the summary content, no preamble. Use Chinese (maybe with English terms). Provide business logic, inputs, outputs.\n\nLet's craft the answer.assistantfinal\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de Tenacity \u91cd\u8bd5\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u6216\u5f02\u6b65\u8c03\u7528\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u91cd\u8bd5\u3002  \n\n**\u8f93\u5165**  \n- `max_retries: int | Retrying | AsyncRetrying`  \n  - `int`\uff1a\u6307\u5b9a\u6700\u5927\u91cd\u8bd5", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:38:55.308114"}
