{"summary": "The code defines a module for handling version information in the Modin project. It imports necessary modules and sets up dictionaries for storing long version strings and a registry of handlers. The `pep440_split_post` function parses a PEP 440-compliant version string, separating the main release part and the post-release segment. It returns a tuple: the main\u00a0the\u00a0... (truncated).\"\n\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. The code snippet includes imports, LONG_VERSION_PY dict, HANDLERS dict, and a function pep440_split_post that splits a version string at \".post\". The user gave a partial summary in the prompt, but we need to produce a summary that meets the requirements: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English). So we need to produce a Chinese summary (maybe with some English). The code is about version handling. So we can say: \u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406 Modin \u9879\u76ee\u7684\u7248\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u6790 PEP 440 \u7248\u672c\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7b49.\n\nWe need to mention inputs: a version string, output: tuple of main version and post-release number (or None). Also mention that LONG_VERSION_PY and HANDLERS are dictionaries for storing version strings and handler functions. The code imports modules for file handling, regex, subprocess, etc., but not used in snippet. So we can mention that.\n\nWe must not start with \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". So start directly with the summary content.\n\nThus: \"\u6a21\u5757 modin/_version.py \u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406 Modin \u9879\u76ee\u7684\u7248\u672c\u4fe1\u606f...\" etc.\n\nLet's produce a concise Chinese summary. Also mention that pep440_split_post returns (release, post) where post is int or None.\n\nOk.assistantfinal\u6a21\u5757 **modin/_version.py** \u8d1f\u8d23\u7ba1\u7406 Modin \u9879\u76ee\u7684\u7248\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002  \n- \u901a\u8fc7 `LONG_VERSION_PY`\uff08`Dict[str, str]`\uff09\u4fdd\u5b58\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7248\u672c\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c`HANDLERS`\uff08`Dict[str, Dict[str, Callable]]`\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u6ce8\u518c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7248\u672c\u5904\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u3002  \n- `pep440_split_post(ver: str) -> Tuple[str, Optional[int]]` \u63a5\u6536\u7b26\u5408 **PEP\u202f440** \u89c4\u8303\u7684\u7248\u672c\u53f7\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32 `ver`\uff0c\u5728\u51fa\u73b0 \u201c`.post`\u201d \u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u5c06\u5176\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:42:39.143704"}
