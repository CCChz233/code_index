{"summary": "The script `scripts/doc_checker.py` is ... ... ... etc...\n\nThe script `scripts/doc_checker.py` is a documentation validation tool designed for checking Python code documentation against NumPy style guidelines and custom Modin-specific rules. It sets up an environment variable to indicate its operation mode, determines the Modin project root directory, and defines sets of error codes for both NumPy and Modin documentation standards. The script imports necessary modules for parsing and validating docstrings, handling file paths, and executing subprocesses. It includes a function `construct_validator` that creates a `Validator` object for a given import path, which is used to load and validate documentation objects. The script is intended to be run from the command line, where it can accept arguments to specify files or directories to check, and it outputs any documentation errors found, categorized by the defined error codes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"The script `scripts/doc_checker.py` is a documentation validation tool designed for checking Python code documentation against NumPy\u00a0...\u00a0\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"The script `scripts/doc_checker.py` is a documentation validation tool designed for checking Python code documentation against NumPy style guidelines and custom Modin-specific rules.
