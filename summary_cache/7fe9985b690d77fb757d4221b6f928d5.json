{"summary": "We need to summarize the functionality of the code snippet. The code is from modin/error_message.py. It defines a class ErrorMessage? Actually the snippet shows \"modin/error_message.py ErrorMessage import warnings from typing import NoReturn, Optional, Set from modin.logging import get_logger from modin.utils import get_current_execution printed_default_to_pandas = False printed_warnings: Set[int] = set()  # Set of hashes of printed warnings     @classmethod\n    def not_initialized(cls, engine: str, code: str) -> None:\n        get_logger().debug(f\"Modin Warning: Not Initialized: {engine}\")\n        warnings.warn(\n            f\"{engine} execution environment not yet initialized. Initializing...\\n\"\n            + \"To remove this warning, run the following python code...\"\n        )\"\n\nWe need to summarize business logic, inputs, outputs. The code defines a class (presumably ErrorMessage) with a class method not_initialized that logs a debug message and issues a warning if the execution environment for a given engine (like Ray or Dask) is not initialized. It takes engine name and code string as inputs, prints a warning with instructions to initialize. It also tracks printed warnings via a set of hashes to avoid duplicate warnings (though not shown in snippet). It also has a flag printed_default_to_pandas.\n\nThus summary: The module provides a utility for handling error/warning messages in Modin. It maintains a global flag printed_default_to_pandas and a set printed_warnings to avoid duplicate warnings. The class method not_initialized logs a debug message and emits a Python warning indicating that the specified execution engine hasn't been initialized, and suggests code to run before DataFrame operations. Input: engine (string) and code (string). Output: side effects: logs debug, prints warning via warnings.warn. No return value.\n\nNow produce Chinese summary. Must start directly with summary content, no \"This code does...\". So start with \"\u8be5\u6a21\u5757...\" etc. Provide business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese.
