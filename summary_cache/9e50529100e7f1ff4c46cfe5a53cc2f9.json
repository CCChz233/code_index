{"summary": "The code defines a function `resolve` that takes a list of tuples containing name and email as input. It resolves the GitHub login for each person based on the provided name and email. The function uses caching and a single resolution method to find the login. It returns a set of resolved logins and a set of unknowns (people who couldn't be resolved). The code also includes imports and other modules related to GitHub and packaging.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code, focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs, in Chinese (or Chinese/English). Must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" etc. So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms.\n\nThe code snippet is incomplete; we have only part of a class method `resolve`. It uses `self.__resolve_cache`, `self.__resolve_single`, `self.__register`. It iterates over `people` list of (name,email). It builds sets `logins` and `unknowns`. It returns them.\n\nWe need to mention that inputs: iterable of (name,email). Output: tuple of two sets: resolved GitHub logins and unknown entries.\n\nBusiness logic: resolve GitHub usernames using cache and single resolution, register mapping.\n\nAlso mention imports: argparse, atexit, collections, json, re, sys, pathlib.Path, github, pygit2, packaging.version. But the core function is about resolving GitHub usernames.\n\nWe need to start directly with the summary content, no preamble.\n\nLet's craft a Chinese summary:\n\n\"\u529f\u80fd\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u59d3\u540d\u548c\u90ae\u7bb1\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u51fa\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684 GitHub \u767b\u5f55\u540d\u3002\u8f93\u5165\u4e3a (name, email) \u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u53ef\u8fed\u4ee3\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u96c6\u5408\uff1a\u5df2\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u767b\u5f55\u540d\u96c6\u5408 `logins`\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u6790\u7684 (name, email) \u5bf9\u96c6\u5408 `unknowns`\u3002\u89e3\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5148\u67e5\u8be2\u5185\u90e8\u7f13\u5b58 (`__resolve_cache`)\uff0c\u82e5\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u5219\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5355\u72ec\u901a\u8fc7\u90ae\u7bb1\u6216\u59d3\u540d\u67e5\u627e (`__resolve_single`)\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u540e\u4f7f\u7528 `__register` \u5c06\u6620\u5c04\u5199\u5165\u7f13\u5b58\u3002\"\n\nAdd mention of imports maybe: \"\u811a\u672c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 argparse\u3001github\u3001pygit2 \u7b49\u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u547d\u4ee4\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u89e3\u6790\u548c GitHub API \u8c03\u7528\u3002\" But the summary should focus on business logic.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u529f\u80fd\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684 **\u59d3\u540d\u2011\u90ae\u7bb1** \u5217\u8868\u89e3\u6790\u5bf9\u5e94", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:43:37.873066"}
