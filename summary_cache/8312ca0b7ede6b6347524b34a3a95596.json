{"summary": "- This code defines an asynchronous instructor client for interacting with OpenAI's chat completion API.\n- It imports necessary modules and defines a generic type variable T.\n- The client has a global variable `client` which can be set to a `OpenAI` client.\n- The `create_iterable` method creates an asynchronous generator that yields a `T` type.\n- The input `messages` is a list of chat messages.\n- The `response_model` is a type that can be (the) ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` \nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English) focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs. Must start directly with the summary content, no preamble. So just a paragraph describing functionality.\n\nLet's analyze code.\n\nFile instructor/client.py\n\nImports: AsyncInstructor from __future__ import annotations (maybe not used). openai, inspect, instructor, utils Provider, get_provider, ChatCompletionMessageParam, typing, tenacity, collections.abc, typing_extensions, pydantic BaseModel, Partial, Hooks, HookName.\n\nDefine generic type variable T bound to Union[BaseModel, \"Iterable[Any]\", \"Partial[Any]\"].\n\nGlobal variables: client: Any | None, create_fn: Callable[..., Any], mode: instructor.Mode, default_model: str | None = None, provider: Provider, hooks: Hooks.\n\nDefine async method create_iterable(self, messages: list[ChatCompletionMessageParam], response_model: type[T], max_retries: int | AsyncRetrying = 3, validation_context: dict[str, Any] | None = None, context: dict[str, Any] | None = None, strict: bool = True, **kwargs: Any) -> AsyncGenerator[T, None]:\n\n- Calls self.handle_kwargs(kwargs) (presumably to process extra args).\n- Sets kwargs[\"stream\"] = True.\n- Calls await self.create_fn(... ) with response_model=Iterable[response_model], validation_context, context, max_retries, messages, strict, hooks=self.hooks, **kwargs.\n- The create_fn returns an async iterable (maybe streaming). For each item, yields item.\n\nThus the business logic: Provide a", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:36:20.313311"}
