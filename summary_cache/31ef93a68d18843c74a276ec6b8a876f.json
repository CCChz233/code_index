{"summary": "The code defines a `ClientSession` class in the `aiohttp` library, which provides an asynchronous HTTP client for making requests. It imports various modules and defines several constants and type aliases. The `ClientSession` class has a `close` method that closes the underlying connector and releases resources. The class also has various attributes such as `_base_url`, `_connector`, `_loop`, `_cookie_jar`, and others that store configuration and state information for the session. The code also defines a `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` constant and a set of idempotent HTTP methods. The `ClientSession` class is used to create a session with a specific configuration and can be used to make HTTP requests.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. They gave a snippet of code from aiohttp/client.py. The code includes imports, __all__, constants, and a close method. The user wants a summary focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs, in Chinese (or Chinese/English). They also want to start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms) that describes the functionality: defines ClientSession class for async HTTP client, handles configuration, default timeout, idempotent methods, close method, etc. Should mention inputs: configuration parameters like base_url, connector, timeout, headers, etc. Outputs: returns a ClientSession instance, close returns None, request methods return ClientResponse or WebSocketResponse.\n\nWe need to follow the requirements: start directly with the summary content, no preamble. Use Chinese (maybe with English terms). Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. So we can write something like:\n\n- \u63d0\u4f9b\u5f02\u6b65 HTTP \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f1a\u8bdd `ClientSession`\uff0c\u5c01\u88c5\u8bf7\u6c42/\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u6c60\u3001Cookie\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u8d85\u65f6\u3001\u91cd\u8bd5\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n- \u8f93\u5165\uff1a\u6784\u9020\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u53d7 base_url\u3001connector\u3001loop\u3001cookie_jar\u3001auth\u3001http_version\u3001json_serialize\u3001requote_redirect_url\u3001timeout\u3001raise_for_status\u3001auto_decompress\u3001trust_env\u3001headers\u3001skip_auto_headers\u3001request_class\u3001response_class\u3001ws_response_class\u3001trace_configs\u3001read_bufsize\u3001max_line_size\u3001max_field_size\u3001charset_resolver\u3001proxy\u3001proxy_auth\u3001retry_connection \u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u3002\n- \u8f93\u51fa\uff1a\u8fd4\u56de `ClientSession` \u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b\u8c03\u7528 `request`\u3001`get`\u3001`post` \u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd4\u56de `ClientResponse` \u6216 `", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:45:50.478447"}
