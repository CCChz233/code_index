The code snippet is incomplete but we can infer. The code defines a class Image (maybe using Pydantic BaseModel) with fields source, media_type, data. It includes a class method from_raw_base64 that decodes base64, checks image type using imghdr, validates MIME type against VALID_MIME_TYPES, returns an instance. It also imports many modules, defines type variables, etc. The summary should be in Chinese (with English optionally). Must start directly with summary content, no preamble. So produce a concise Chinese summary focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs. Mention that it validates MIME types, supports URL/file/base64, returns Image object. Also mention caching not needed. Provide details.
