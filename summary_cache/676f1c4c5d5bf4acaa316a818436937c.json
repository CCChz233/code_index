{"summary": "- Provides a resolver module for asynchronous DNS resolution in aiohttp.\n- Defines a ThreadedResolver class that uses a thread pool to perform DNS lookup.\n- Imports asyncio and socket.\n- Uses the AbstractResolver and ResolveResult from the .abc module.\n- Defines a set of constants for socket-related.\n- Defines a ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````...\nWe need to summarize functionality of the code snippet. The snippet is incomplete but we can infer. It defines __all__, constants, DefaultResolver selection based on aiodns_default variable. There's a close method placeholder. Provide business logic: asynchronous DNS resolution, thread fallback, etc. Provide inputs/outputs: resolve(host, port, family) returns ResolveResult list of (family, type, proto, canonname, sockaddr). Provide that ThreadedResolver uses getaddrinfo in thread pool. Provide that AsyncResolver uses aiodns library. Provide that DefaultResolver picks appropriate class. Provide that close method does nothing for ThreadedResolver. Provide that module used by aiohttp client to resolve hostnames. Provide Chinese description.
