It scans the `aiohttp` directory to collect header names, builds a nested dictionary (trie) where each node corresponds to a character and terminal nodes store the full header string. Using this trie, it constructs C code with macros and switch\u2011case blocks that walk through the input string character by character (`NEXT_CHAR()`), compare each character against the trie, and return the index of the matching header or `-1` if not found. The output is a C source file containing the generated `find_header` function and related macros. Inputs are the filesystem path (`ROOT`) and the header list derived from `calc_headers`; output is the generated C code written to a file (not shown in the snippet).", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:32:51.792751"}
