{"summary": "- The code defines a CLI (Command Line Interface) application using the `typer` library.\n- It imports various modules and functions.\n- It creates a `OpenAI` client.\n- It defines a function `get_file_status` that retrieves the `status` of a file.\n- The function ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````... \nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the given code. They gave a snippet of code and a partial summary. They want the answer to start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English). So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms) describing the code's functionality: it's a CLI app using typer, defines a function get_file_status that takes a file_id string and returns its status by calling OpenAI client files.retrieve. The code also sets up console and table from rich, but not used yet. So the summary: defines CLI, imports, creates OpenAI client, defines function to get file status. Input: file_id string; output: status string. Also mention that the CLI app is prepared but no commands defined yet. So produce Chinese summary. Must start directly with summary content, no preamble.
