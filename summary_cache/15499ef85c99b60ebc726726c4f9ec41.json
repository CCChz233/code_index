It creates a `Spectrum` object with predefined m/z and intensity arrays, then applies `select_by_mz` without any filtering parameters. The test verifies that the output spectrum retains all original peaks, ensuring the m/z and intensity arrays remain unchanged and of equal length. This validates the default behavior of `select_by_mz` when no selection criteria are provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"The code defines a unit test for the `select_by_mz` function...\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"The code defines a unit test for the `select_by_mz` function from the `matchms.filtering` module.
