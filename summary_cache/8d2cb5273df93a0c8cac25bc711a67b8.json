{"summary": "The script `doc_checker.py` is a command-line tool for checking docstrings in Python code. It uses the `pydocstyle` and `numpydoc` libraries to validate docstrings against a set of predefined error codes. The script accepts a list of paths (files or directories) to check, and optionally adds a set of `pydocstyle` error codes to ignore. It also provides a flag to disable `numpydoc` checks. The script validates the arguments and checks the docstrings for each file in the given paths. The output is a `list` of ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````...\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. They gave a snippet of code but not the whole file. The code includes imports, environment variable, constants, and a function get_args. The user wants a summary focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs, in Chinese (or Chinese/English). Must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" etc. So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). Should mention that it's a CLI tool for checking docstrings using pydocstyle and numpydoc, accepts paths, optional ignore codes, disable flag, returns parsed args, etc. Also mention error codes definitions. Output is likely printed results or list of errors. The snippet only includes get_args, but the description says script checks docstrings. So we can summarize overall functionality.\n\nLet's produce a Chinese summary: \"\u811a\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u547d\u4ee4\u884c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u67e5 Python \u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684 docstring\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 pydocstyle \u4e0e numpydoc\uff0c\u63a5\u53d7\u8def\u5f84\u5217\u8868\u3001\u53ef\u9009\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7801\u3001\u53ef\u5173\u95ed numpydoc \u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u89e3\u6790\u540e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u4f1a\u904d\u5386\u8def\u5f84\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u89c4\u8303\u7684 docstring \u9519\u8bef\u3002\" Also mention environment variable and error code sets.\n\nMake sure to start directly with the summary content, no preamble.
