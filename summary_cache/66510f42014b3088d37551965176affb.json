It includes `MultipartReader` and `MultipartWriter` for parsing and constructing multipart bodies, `BodyPartReader` for reading individual parts, and utilities for handling content disposition headers. The module supports various payload types (JSON, strings, etc.), compression utilities, and header parsing. It also includes regular expressions for validating token characters and quoted text. The primary inputs are HTTP multipart messages, and the outputs are parsed parts or constructed multipart bodies.
