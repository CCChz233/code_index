{"summary": "- Function `normalize_intensities` takes a spectrum object (`SpectrumType`) as input, clones it, and normalizes its peak intensities to a unit height (max intensity = 1). If the input is `None` or the spectrum has no peaks, it returns the original (or `None`). The output is a new spectrum object with normalized intensities.", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:41:11.143811"}
