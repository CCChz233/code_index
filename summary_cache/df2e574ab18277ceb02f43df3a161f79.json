Summarize the functionality of the following code. Requirements: 1. Start directly with the summary content. No \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". 2. Focus on the business logic, inputs, and outputs. 3. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English).\"\n\nThen they gave code snippet and a partial answer (the assistant responded with a summary but cut off). The user now says \"Continue from where you left off. Do not add any additional sections. Do not repeat the summary.\"\n\nSo we need to continue the summary from where it left off. The previous summary ended abruptly: \"If `ininy` (the **...** ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\". It seems the assistant got cut off. We need to continue the summary, completing the description of the function's behavior, focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (maybe with some English). Must start directly with the summary content (no intro). Must not add any additional sections or repeat the summary. So we just continue the description.\n\nLet's reconstruct the function:\n\n```\ndef harmonize_undefined_inchi(spectrum_in: SpectrumType, undefined=\"\", aliases=None):\n    if spectrum_in is None:\n        return None\n\n    spectrum = spectrum_in.clone()\n\n    if aliases is None:\n        aliases = [\"\", \"N/A\", \"NA\", \"n/a\"]\n\n    inchi = spectrum.get(\"inchi\")\n    if inchi is None:\n        # spectrum does not have an \"inchi\" key in its metadata\n        spectrum.set(\"inchi\", undefined)\n        return spectrum\n\n    if inchi in", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:41:53.719461"}
