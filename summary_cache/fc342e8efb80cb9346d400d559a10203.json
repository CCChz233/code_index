{"summary": "The code defines a module for handling wave audio files. It includes a Wave_write class that provides functionality for writing wave files. The class has a setnframes method that allows setting the number of frames in the wave file. However, it raises an error if the data has already been written, preventing the modification of parameters after writing has started.\n\nThe module also includes a named tuple named _wave_params which defines the parameters of the wave file.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code, focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs, in Chinese (or Chinese/English). Must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese, describing the module's purpose, classes, functions, inputs/outputs.\n\nThe code snippet is incomplete but we can infer: It's a wave module with open, Error, Wave_read, Wave_write. It defines constants for PCM format, extensible format, and a GUID for PCM subtype. It defines array format mapping, a namedtuple for wave parameters. It defines a method setnframes in Wave_write that sets number of frames but raises Error if data already written.\n\nThus summary: This module provides wave file handling, especially writing wave files. The business logic: open wave files, write audio data, enforce constraints. Input: parameters like nchannels, sampwidth, framerate, nframes, comptype, compname; setnframes method takes integer nframes. Output: writes wave file to file-like object, raises Error if misuse.\n\nWe need to mention that __all__ includes open, Error, Wave_read, Wave_write. The code uses struct, sys, builtins.\n\nThus produce Chinese summary.\n\nMake sure to start directly with summary content, no preamble. Use Chinese. Possibly include English terms for class names.\n\nLet's produce.assistantfinal\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9 WAV \u97f3\u9891\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u8bfb\u5199\u5c01\u88c5\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\n\n- **\u516c\u5f00\u63a5\u53e3**\uff1a`open`, `Error`, `Wave_read`, `Wave_write`\uff08\u901a\u8fc7 `__all__` \u5bfc\u51fa\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6253\u5f00\u6587\u4ef6\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bfb\u53d6\u548c\u5199\u5165\u529f\u80fd\u3002  \n- **\u5e38\u91cf\u5b9a\u4e49**\uff1a`WAVE_FORMAT_PCM`\u3001`WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` \u4ee5\u53ca `KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_PCM`\uff08PCM \u5b50\u7c7b\u578b GUID\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6587\u4ef6\u5934\u4e2d\u6807\u8bc6\u97f3\u9891\u683c\u5f0f\u3002  \n- **\u53c2\u6570\u7ed3\u6784**\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528 `", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:52:26.148973"}
