{"summary": "We have a code snippet from a Python module `instructor/multimodal.py`. It defines a class `Audio` (??). The snippet includes imports, type definitions, constants, and a class method `from_url`. The method `from_url` creates an `Audio` class instance from a URL.\n\nThe method checks that the URL ends with `.wav` (for audio). It uses `requests` to fetch the audio file, then encode its binary content into base64 string. Then returns a ****?**?.\n\nWe need to summarize the functionality of the code. The code snippet includes imports, type definitions, constants, and a class method `from_m...?` Actually the snippet ends with `return cls(source=url, data=data)`. So there is a class `Audio` defined elsewhere (maybe in the same file). The method `from_url` is a class method that returns an instance of `Audio` with `source` set to the URL and `data` set to base64-encoded audio content.\n\nThus the summary: The code defines a class method `from_url` that validates the URL ends with `.wav`, fetches the audio file via HTTP GET, encodes the binary content to base64, and returns an `Audio` instance with the original URL and encoded data.\n\nWe also need to mention the imports and constants: The code imports many modules for handling multimodal data, such as `base64`, `re`, `requests`, `pydantic`, etc. It defines a list of valid MIME types for images, but not used in the snippet. It defines type variables for generic functions. It defines a Pydantic field `source` and `data` for the `Audio` class.\n\nThus the summary: The code defines a Pydantic model for audio data with fields `source` (URL or file path) and `data` (base64 encoded audio). It provides a class method `from_url` to create an instance from a remote WAV file.\n\nNow we need to produce the answer in Chinese (with some English if needed). The answer must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" etc. So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese.\n\nLet's produce:\n\n- \u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91: \u9a8c\u8bc1 URL \u5fc5\u987b\u662f .wav\uff0c\u4e0b\u8f7d\u97f3\u9891\uff0c\u8f6c\u4e3a base64\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de Audio \u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\n- \u8f93\u5165: URL \u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3002\n- \u8f93\u51fa: Audio \u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5305\u542b source (URL) \u548c data (base64 \u7f16", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:37:33.494388"}
