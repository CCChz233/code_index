{"summary": "The code defines a module `pipes` with a `Template` class for building and managing pipeline templates. It imports necessary modules (`re`, `os`, `tempfile`, `warnings`, `quote`). It defines constants representing various pipeline step types (e.g., `FILEIN_FILEOUT` etc.) and a list `stepkinds` containing all these types. The `clone` method creates a new `Template` instance, copies its steps and debugging flag.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code, focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs, in Chinese (or Chinese/English). Must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms. The code snippet includes imports, __all__, constants, stepkinds list, and a clone method inside Template class. The code snippet is incomplete (the Template class definition is not shown fully). But we can summarize based on what's given.\n\nWe need to mention that the module provides pipeline template handling, constants for step kinds, and a clone method that returns a new Template with same steps and debugging flag.\n\nWe should mention inputs: the Template instance's steps and debugging flag; output: a new Template instance.\n\nWe can also mention that the constants represent different pipeline configurations (file input/output, stdin/stdout, source, sink). The stepkinds list aggregates them.\n\nWe need to follow the requirement: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" etc. So start with something like \"\u6a21\u5757 `pipes` \u63d0\u4f9b\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u6a21\u677f\u7684 `Template` \u7c7b...\" etc.\n\nLet's produce a concise Chinese summary. Also mention that __all__ restricts export to Template.\n\nOk.assistantfinal\u6a21\u5757 `pipes` \u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u6a21\u677f\u7684 `Template` \u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 `__all__ = [\"Template\"]` \u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u5916\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\u3002  \n- \u5e38\u91cf `FILEIN_FILEOUT\u3001STDIN_FILEOUT\u3001FILEIN_STDOUT\u3001STDIN_STDOUT\u3001SOURCE\u3001SINK` \u5206\u522b\u6807\u8bc6\u7ba1\u9053\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e0d\u540c I/O \u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u6587\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165/\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u8f93\u5165/\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u6e90\u5934\u3001\u7ec8\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u6536\u5f55\u5728\u5217\u8868 `stepkinds` \u4e2d\uff0c\u4f9b\u6a21\u677f\u89e3\u6790\u65f6\u6821\u9a8c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7c7b\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u3002  \n- `Template.clone()` \u65b9\u6cd5\u63a5\u53d7\u5f53\u524d `Template` \u5b9e\u4f8b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T21:00:55.202954"}
