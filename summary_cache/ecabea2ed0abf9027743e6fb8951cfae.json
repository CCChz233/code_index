{"summary": "The code defines a `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````... \nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English). The code snippet is extremely short: \n\n```\nmodin/polars/groupby.py GroupBy from typing import TYPE_CHECKING apply = map_groups     def agg(self, *aggs, **named_aggs):\n        raise NotImplementedError(\"not yet\")\n```\n\nIt seems to be part of a file `modin/polars/groupby.py`. There's a class `GroupBy` maybe, but the snippet shows \"GroupBy from typing import TYPE_CHECKING apply = map_groups\". Actually it's not clear. The snippet is truncated. It defines a method `agg` that raises NotImplementedError. So the functionality: It defines a placeholder for aggregation on a groupby object, not implemented yet.\n\nThus summary: The code defines a GroupBy class (or part of it) with an `agg` method that currently raises NotImplementedError, indicating aggregation not yet supported. The inputs are variable positional arguments `*aggs` and keyword arguments `**named_aggs`. Output: raises exception.\n\nThus answer: Chinese summary. Provide business logic: placeholder for groupby aggregation in Modin's Polars backend.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u8be5\u6587\u4ef6\u5c5e\u4e8e Modin \u5bf9 Polars \u540e\u7aef\u7684 `GroupBy` \u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5360\u4f4d\u7684 `agg` \u65b9\u6cd5\u3002  \n- **\u8f93\u5165**\uff1a\u63a5\u53d7\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u805a\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff08`*aggs`\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u547d\u540d\u805a\u5408\uff08`**named_aggs`\uff09\u3002  \n- **\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91**\uff1a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f53\u76f4\u63a5\u629b\u51fa `NotImplementedError(\"not yet\")`\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u805a\u5408\u529f\u80fd\u5c1a\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002  \n- **\u8f93\u51fa**\uff1a\u59cb\u7ec8\u89e6\u53d1\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u7528\u65b9\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u6682\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3002  \n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u58f0\u660e `GroupBy` \u7684\u805a\u5408\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u805a\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u4ecd\u5f85\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T21:01:13.516027"}
