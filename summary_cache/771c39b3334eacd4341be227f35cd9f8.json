{"summary": "The code defines a module `````?\n\nThe module defines constants and a named tuple for handling Sun audio file parameters, including channel count, sample width, frame rate, and encoding types. It provides a `writeframes` method that writes raw audio data to a file and ensures the file header is updated if the number of frames or data length written does not match the expected values. This method is part of a class that likely manages Sun audio file I/O. The inputs are raw audio data, and the output is an updated audio file with a corrected header.\n\n```\n\nThe code defines a module for handling Sun audio files, including constants for audio file magic numbers, encoding types, and unknown size.
