The snippet is part of a module `graphlib.py` that defines a `TopologicalSorter` class and a `__class_getitem__` method. The snippet includes a method `static_order` which returns an iterable (like a generator) that yields **...**.\n\nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese, focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs. No \"This code does...\" etc. So we need to start directly with the summary content.\n\nWe need to mention that the method static_order returns an iterable of nodes in topological order, preparing the sorter, iterating while active, getting ready nodes, yielding them, marking them done. It raises CycleError if a cycle is detected. The inputs: the graph stored in the TopologicalSorter instance; the output: generator of nodes in topological order.\n\nWe also need to mention that __class_getitem__ is defined as classmethod(GenericAlias) to support typing.\n\nWe need to mention that _NODE_OUT and _NODE_DONE are sentinel values.\n\nWe need to mention that __all__ includes TopologicalSorter and CycleError.\n\nWe need to mention that the code is part of a library for topological sorting.\n\nWe need to produce a concise summary in Chinese.\n\nLet's produce it.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e `TopologicalSorter` \u5b9e\u4f8b\u5185\u90e8\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6392\u5e8f\u529f\u80fd\u3002  \n- **\u8f93\u5165**\uff1a\u5df2\u901a\u8fc7 `add`\u3001`add_many` \u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5411 `TopologicalSorter` \u5b9e\u4f8b\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u53ca\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5185\u90e8\u4ee5\u5b57\u5178/\u96c6\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u4fdd\u5b58\uff09\u3002  \n- **\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91**\uff1a`static_order` \u5728\u8c03\u7528\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u6267\u884c `prepare()` \u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6392\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5728\u56fe\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u6d3b\u8dc3\uff08\u672a\u5168\u90e8\u5b8c\u6210\uff09\u65f6\u5faa\u73af\uff1a  \n  1. \u8c03\u7528 `get_ready()` \u53d6\u5f97\u5f53\u524d\u6240\u6709\u5165\u5ea6\u4e3a 0\u3001\u5c1a\u672a\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u96c6\u5408\uff08\u5373\u201c\u5c31\u7eea\u201d\u8282\u70b9\uff09\u3002  \n  2. \u4f7f\u7528 `yield from` \u5c06\u8be5\u96c6\u5408\u9010\u4e2a\u4ea7\u51fa\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e8f\u5217\u3002  \n  3. \u8c03\u7528 `done(*node_group)` \u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8282\u70b9\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u5df2\u5b8c\u6210\uff08\u5185\u90e8\u5c06\u5176\u72b6\u6001\u8bbe\u4e3a `_", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:54:14.414562"}
