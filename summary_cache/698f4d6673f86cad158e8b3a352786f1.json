It imports necessary libraries, sets up logging, and defines a generic type variable `T`. A `classproperty` decorator is used to generate a Gemini-compatible function schema from an OpenAI schema, mapping parameters and metadata accordingly. This enables seamless integration of function definitions across different AI platforms. The output is a Gemini `FunctionDeclaration` object containing the function name, description, and parameter schema.", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:45:23.832525"}
