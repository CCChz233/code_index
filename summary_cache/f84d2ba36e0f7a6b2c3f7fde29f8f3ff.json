{"summary": "The module provides utilities for compiling Python code snippets with custom flags. It imports future features, gathers them into `_features`, and defines `__all__` to expose `compile_command`, `Compile`, and `CommandCompiler`. Two flag constants `PyCF_DONT_IMPLY_DEDENT` and `PyCF_ALLOW_INCOMPLETE_INPUT` are defined. The `__call__` method (presumably of a class) takes a source string, a filename, and a symbol (e.g., 'exec', 'eval'), compiles the source using Python's built\u2011like `compile` with the instance's `flags` and a `dont_skip` argument set to True. After compilation, it iterates over future feature flags\u00a0\u2014\u00a0checking whether the compiled code object's `co_flags` includes any of those feature flags \u2014 and updates the `flags` attribute of the (the\u00a0... )...\n```", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T21:00:31.556368"}
