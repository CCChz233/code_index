{"summary": "The code defines a DataFrame class in the modin/polars/dataframe.py module. It imports necessary modules and defines properties for columns and sorted columns. It also defines various write methods for different file formats, but they are not implemented yet. The code also includes a method to set the sorted columns cache.\n\nBusiness logic:\n- The code defines a DataFrame class that represents a data structure.\n- It imports various modules and imports the `` from ``.\n- It defines a `` property.\n- It defines a `` property.\n- It defines `` methods.\n```\n\nWe need to produce a summary of the functionality of the code. The code snippet is from modin/polars/dataframe.py. It includes imports, defines a DataFrame class? Actually the snippet shows \"modin/polars/dataframe.py DataFrame from __future__ import annotations from collections import OrderedDict from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, Iterable, Iterator, Literal, Sequence import numpy as np import pandas import polars from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_list_like from modin.core.storage_formats.base.query_compiler import BaseQueryCompiler from modin.pandas import DataFrame as ModinPandasDataFrame from modin.pandas import Series as ModinPandasSeries from modin.pandas.io import from_pandas from modin.polars.base import BasePolarsDataset columns = property(_get_columns, _set_columns) _sorted_columns_cache = None _sorted_columns = property(_get_sorted_columns, _set_sorted_columns) with_row_count = with_row_index write_avro = write_clipboard = write_csv = write_database = write_delta = (         write_excel     ) = write_ipc = write_ipc_stream = write_json = write_ndjson = write_parquet = (         write_parquet_partitioned     ) = lambda ... NotImplementedError ... _set_sorted_columns method.\n\nThus the code defines a DataFrame class that inherits from BasePolarsDataset? Actually not shown but likely. It defines properties for columns and sorted columns, with getters and setters. It defines placeholder methods for writing to various file formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.) that raise NotImplementedError. It also defines a method to set sorted columns cache.\n\nThe business logic: It sets up a DataFrame wrapper for Polars within Modin, providing column handling and stubs for I/O operations.\n\nInputs: The DataFrame would be constructed from data (not shown). The write methods accept arguments for file paths and options.", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T21:02:38.397780"}
