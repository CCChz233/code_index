{"summary": "The code defines ****.\nWe need to summarize functionality. Let's read code. It's a script bench-asyncio-write.py. It imports asyncio, atexit, math, os, signal, typing List Tuple. PORT=8888. server = os.fork(). So forks process. writes = list of tuples: (\"b''.join\", write_joined_list), (\"bytearray\", write_joined_bytearray), (\"multiple writes\", write_separately). So there are functions defined elsewhere? Not shown. bodies = tuple of various lists of sizes: empty list, [10 * 2**0], [10 * 2**7], etc. Also list comprehensions for repeated sizes. jobs = [_job(j) for j in bodies]. So _job likely creates a coroutine job for each body. loop = asyncio.get_event_loop(). results = loop.run_until_complete(main(loop)). So main is async function that runs benchmark. fm_size formats size in human readable. So overall script benchmarks different write strategies (join, bytearray, multiple writes) for various payload sizes using asyncio server on port 8888. It forks a server process, then runs client jobs to send data and measure performance. Output likely results printed.\n\nThus summary: The script sets up an asyncio benchmark for writing data over a socket, comparing three methods of constructing the payload (join, bytearray, multiple writes) across a range of payload sizes. It forks a server process listening on port 8888, creates jobs for each payload size, runs them in an event loop, and collects results. It includes a helper to format byte sizes.\n\nNow produce Chinese summary. Must start directly with summary content, no intro. So just Chinese description. Include business logic, inputs, outputs. Inputs: bodies list of payload sizes, writes methods. Output: results (likely printed).
