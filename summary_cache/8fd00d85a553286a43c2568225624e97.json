{"summary": "- This module defines a DataFrame class for Modin's Polars backend, extending functionality from Modin's pandas and Polars libraries.\n- It imports necessary modules and types, including numpy, pandas, and Polars, and sets up type checking.\n- The DataFrame class includes properties for accessing and setting column names (`columns`) and sorted columns (`_sorted_columns`), with caching support.\n- Several write methods (e.g., `write_csv`, `write_parquet`) are defined as placeholders, raising NotImplementedError.\n- The `ddtype` property returns a ****.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. The code snippet is from modin/polars/dataframe.py. It defines DataFrame class for Modin's Polars backend. The code includes imports, property definitions, placeholder write methods raising NotImplementedError, and dtypes property that returns a Polars DataFrame's dtypes derived from pandas dtypes.\n\nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese (with possibly English). Must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Should focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese.\n\nWe need to incorporate the details: DataFrame class extends Modin's pandas DataFrame and Polars integration. It provides column handling, sorted column caching, placeholder write methods, dtypes property converting pandas dtypes to Polars.\n\nAlso mention that the write methods are not implemented and raise NotImplementedError.\n\nThe code snippet includes a property dtypes that returns a Polars DataFrame's dtypes based on the underlying query compiler's dtypes.\n\nWe need to summarize the functionality: It defines a DataFrame class for Modin's Polars backend, handling column metadata, sorted columns caching, and exposing dtypes property; write methods are stubs.\n\nLet's produce a concise Chinese summary.\n\nMake sure to start directly with the summary content, no preamble.\n\nLet's write:\n\n\"\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 Modin \u5728 Polars \u540e\u7aef\u7684 DataFrame \u7c7b\uff0c...\"\n\nOk. Provide business logic: inputs: column names, underlying query compiler; outputs: column list, sorted columns, dtypes, NotImplementedError for write methods.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 Modin \u5728 Polars \u540e\u7aef\u7684 **DataFrame** \u7c7b\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\n\n- **\u5217\u7ba1\u7406**\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7 `columns` \u5c5e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u5217\u540d\u7684\u8bfb\u53d6\u4e0e\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b\u5185\u90e8\u7ef4\u62a4 `_sorted_columns_cache`\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 `_sorted_columns", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T21:02:42.538736"}
