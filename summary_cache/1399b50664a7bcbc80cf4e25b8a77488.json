The code snippet is incomplete; it ends abruptly. However, we can infer the purpose: It's part of a DSL for \"Partial\" models, likely to create partial versions of Pydantic models where fields become optional. The function _wrap_models processes a FieldInfo, handling generic types and nested BaseModel types, converting them to Partial versions recursively.\n\nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese (with possible English). Must start directly with the summary content, no intro phrase. So output should be a concise description of business logic, inputs, outputs.\n\nLet's craft: The code defines a generic type T_Model bound to BaseModel, imports, defines function _wrap_models(field: FieldInfo) -> tuple[object, FieldInfo]. It deep copies the field, gets annotation, if generic, reconstructs with processed generic args via _process_generic_arg (not shown). If annotation is subclass of BaseModel, replace with Partial[annotation]. Returns modified annotation and field.\n\nThus summary: It takes a Pydantic field definition, returns a tuple of the possibly transformed type (making nested models partial and handling generics) and the updated FieldInfo.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u5bf9 Pydantic `FieldInfo` \u8fdb\u884c\u5305\u88c5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u751f\u6210 \u201cPartial\u201d \u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u9012\u5f52\u5730\u628a\u5d4c\u5957\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b57\u6bb5\u8bbe\u4e3a\u53ef\u9009\uff0c\u5e76\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u6cdb\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u3002  \n\n**\u8f93\u5165**  \n- `field: FieldInfo` \u2014\u2014 \u5305\u542b\u5b57\u6bb5\u6ce8\u89e3\uff08type hint\uff09\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684 Pydantic \u5b57", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:57:49.852355"}
