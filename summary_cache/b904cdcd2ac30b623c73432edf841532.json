{"summary": "The code defines a module for handling ZIP files, providing classes and constants for creating, reading, and manipulating ZIP archives. It includes definitions for various compression methods (stored, deflated, bzip2, lzma), ZIP format limits, and structures for parsing ZIP file headers and central directory entries. The `ZipInfo` class encapsulates metadata for each file in the archive, such as filename, timestamps, compression type, and file attributes. It normalizes filenames to use forward slashes, validates timestamps, and sets default values for system-specific attributes. The module also defines error classes (`BadZipFile`, `BadZipfile`) and utility functions for checking ZIP file validity.\n```\n\nThe code defines a module for handling ZIP files, providing classes and constants for creating, reading, and manipulating ZIP archives.
