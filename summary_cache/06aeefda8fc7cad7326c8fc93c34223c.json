{"summary": "- The script provides a version management system for Python projects using Git as the VCS.\n- It defines a configuration class `VersioneerConfig` to hold VCS, style, tag prefix etc.\n- It registers and implements handlers for various VCS methods (like `git_get_keywords` and `git_versions_from_keywords).\n- Core functionality: `run_command` executes external commands (git) and captures output.\n- `git_pieces_from_vcs` extracts a detailed version \"piece\" dictionary from a git repository: full and short commit hashes, branch name, tag, distance from tag, dirty state, and commit date.\n- The version string is rendered into various styles (PEP 440, git-describe etc.) based on the pieces.\n- `get_versions` orchestrates the process: uses keyword expansion (if available), then VCS (git) info, then parent directory name, finally defaults to \"0+unknown.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. Requirements: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (Chinese/English). So we need to produce a Chinese summary (maybe with some English terms). Provide concise description of what the code does: version management, extracting version info from git, handling various cases, rendering version strings, etc. Should mention inputs: configuration, repository path, etc., outputs: version dict. Also mention functions: get_versions, run_command, git_pieces_from_vcs, etc. Provide business logic: compute version based on git tags, commit distance, dirty state, branch, parent directory, fallback. Provide that it registers VCS handlers. Provide that it can render different version styles (pep440, git-describe). Provide that it can be used by setup.py. Provide that it uses environment variables, etc.\n\nLet's craft a Chinese summary with some English terms for clarity. Ensure we start directly with the summary content, no preamble. Use Chinese sentences. Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e Git \u7684 Python \u9879\u76ee\u7248\u672c\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u6d41\u7a0b\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n1. **\u914d\u7f6e\u8bfb\u53d6**  \n   - `VersioneerConfig` \u4fdd\u5b58 VCS \u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e3a `git`\uff09\u3001\u7248\u672c\u53f7\u6e32\u67d3\u98ce\u683c\uff08`pep440`\u3001`git-describe` \u7b49\uff09\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u524d\u7f00\u3001\u7236\u76ee\u5f55\u524d\u7f00\u3001\u7248\u672c\u6587\u4ef6\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u8f93\u51fa\u8c03\u8bd5\u4fe1\u606f\u3002  \n   - `get_config", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:33:15.892352"}
