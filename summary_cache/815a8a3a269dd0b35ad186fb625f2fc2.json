{"summary": "We need to summarize the functionality of the code snippet. The snippet is from aiohttp/resolver.py. It defines ThreadedResolver, AsyncResolver, DefaultResolver. It imports asyncio, socket, typing. It defines __all__ = (\"ThreadedResolver\", \"AsyncResolver\", \"DefaultResolver\"). It defines some constants: _NUMERIC_SOCKET_FLAGS = socket.AI_NUMERICHOST | socket.AI_NUMERICSERV, _NAME_SOCKET_FLAGS = socket.NI_NUMERICHOST | socket.NI_NUMERICSERV. It defines _DefaultType = Type[Union[AsyncResolver, ThreadedResolver]]. Then defines DefaultResolver: _DefaultType = AsyncResolver if aiodns_default else ThreadedResolver. Then __init__ sets self._loop = asyncio.get_running_loop().\n\nThus the code defines a resolver abstraction for aiohttp, providing asynchronous DNS resolution using either aiodns (AsyncResolver) or a thread-based fallback (ThreadedResolver). The DefaultResolver picks which implementation to use based on aiodns availability. The resolver uses asyncio event loop.\n\nWe need to summarize business logic, inputs, outputs. The code snippet is incomplete but we can infer that the resolver classes implement AbstractResolver interface, providing resolve(host, port, family) returning ResolveResult (list of (family, type, proto, canonname, sockaddr)). The ThreadedResolver uses getaddrinfo in a thread pool. AsyncResolver uses aiodns library.\n\nThus summary: The module defines a DNS resolver abstraction for aiohttp. It exports three resolver classes: ThreadedResolver (uses blocking socket.getaddrinfo in a thread pool), AsyncResolver (uses aiodns for non-blocking DNS), and DefaultResolver (chooses between them based on aiodns availability). The resolver classes accept host, port, address family, and return a list of address info tuples (family, type, proto, canonname, sockaddr). The DefaultResolver's __init__ captures the current asyncio event loop.\n\nWe need to output in Chinese (with English optional). Provide summary directly.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b aiohttp \u4f7f\u7528\u7684 DNS \u89e3\u6790\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u3002  \n- **\u5bfc\u51fa\u5bf9\u8c61**\uff1a`ThreadedResolver`\u3001`AsyncResolver`\u3001`DefaultResolver`\uff08\u901a\u8fc7 `__all__` \u66b4\u9732\uff09\u3002  \n- **\u5e38\u91cf**\uff1a`_NUMERIC_SOCKET_FLAGS`\u3001`_NAME_SOCKET_FLAGS` \u7528\u4e8e\u5728 `socket.getaddrinfo` / `socket.getnameinfo` \u8c03\u7528", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T21:02:13.104286"}
