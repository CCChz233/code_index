{"summary": "- This module defines a StreamResponse class for handling HTTP responses in an aiohttp web server.\n- It imports various modules and functions for handling HTTP headers, payloads, and compression.\n- The class has a number of attributes and methods for creating and handling HTTP response.\n```\"\n\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. The user gave a snippet of code from aiohttp/web_response.py. The user gave requirements: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English). So we need to produce a summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). The summary should describe the functionality: it's a module that defines StreamResponse class for handling HTTP responses in aiohttp. It imports modules for handling HTTP headers, payloads, compression. The class has attributes and methods for creating and handling HTTP response. The code snippet includes imports, constants, __all__, content codings, slots, a private attribute _body, and a method _set_status that sets status and reason.\n\nWe need to summarize the business logic: handling HTTP response, setting status, reason phrase, handling headers, cookies, compression, chunked encoding, payload writing, etc. Input: HTTP request, status code, reason, headers, body, etc. Output: HTTP response sent to client.\n\nWe need to avoid \"This code does...\" and start directly with the summary. So start with something like \"\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9b...\" or \"\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0...\" in Chinese.\n\nLet's produce a concise summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms like \"StreamResponse\", \"HTTP\", \"aiohttp\". Also mention that it defines ContentCoding enum, json_response function, etc.\n\nWe need to mention that the code defines constants like REASON_PHRASES mapping HTTP status codes to phrases, CONTENT_CODINGS mapping coding values to enum, __slots__ for memory optimization, and a private method _set_status for setting status and reason, with validation.\n\nWe can also mention that the class inherits from CookieMixin, HeadersMixin, etc. But the snippet doesn't show inheritance, but imports CookieMixin, HeadersMixin. The class likely inherits from those mixins.\n\nWe need to mention that the code handles compression via ZLibCompressor, chunked transfer encoding, keep-alive, etc.\n\nWe need to mention that the code uses type hints, and defines JSONEncoder, LooseHeaders types.\n\nWe need to mention that the code includes functions for parsing HTTP dates", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:55:08.117409"}
