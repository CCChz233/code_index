{"summary": "The script defines a `GitWrapper` class that interacts with Git repositories and GitHub. It parses command-line arguments to determine the release version, target branch, and other settings. The main functionality includes:\n- **Input**: Command-line arguments (e.g., ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` \nThe code snippet provided is incomplete and only shows a partial function `ensure_title_link` within a `GitWrapper` class. This function extracts the title\u00a0...\nWe need to summarize functionality of the code. The code snippet includes imports and a method ensure_title_link. The rest of script not shown. We must summarize based on given snippet. Provide business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese. Start directly with summary. No preamble. Let's craft.\n\nThe method ensure_title_link takes a pygit2.Commit object, extracts first line of commit message, checks if it ends with \"(#number)\" pattern, if not appends short commit id in parentheses. Returns modified title. The script overall seems to be a release automation tool interacting with Git and GitHub, parsing args for version, branch, etc. But we only have partial. Provide summary accordingly.\n\nLet's produce answer.assistantfinal\u8be5\u811a\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e Git \u4e0e GitHub \u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n1. **\u8f93\u5165**  \n   - \u547d\u4ee4\u884c\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u53d1\u5e03\u7248\u672c\u53f7\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u652f\u3001\u662f\u5426\u5f3a\u5236\u53d1\u5e03\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 `argparse` \u89e3\u6790\u3002  \n   - `pygit2.Commit` \u5bf9\u8c61\uff1a\u4ee3\u8868\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u63d0\u4ea4\u3002\n\n2. **\u4e3b\u8981\u529f\u80fd**  \n   - **ensure_title_link**\uff1a  \n     - \u63a5\u6536 `pygit2.Commit` \u5b9e\u4f8b `obj`\u3002  \n     - \u53d6\u63d0\u4ea4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u884c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u9898 `title`\u3002  \n     - \u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u5219 `.*\\(#(\\d+)\\)$` \u68c0\u67e5\u6807\u9898\u662f\u5426\u5df2\u5305\u542b\u5f62\u5982 `(#123)` \u7684 issue/PR \u7f16\u53f7\u3002  \n     - \u82e5\u672a\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5219\u5728\u6807\u9898\u672b\u5c3e\u8ffd\u52a0\u5f53\u524d\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u77ed SHA\uff08`obj.short_id`\uff09\uff0c\u683c\u5f0f\u4e3a ` (abcd123", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:44:01.324837"}
