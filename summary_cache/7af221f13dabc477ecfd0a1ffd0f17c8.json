{"summary": "The code defines a CLI command `download_file` \nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English). The requirements: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English). So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms.\n\nThe code: It's a CLI command using Typer. It defines a command \"download_file\" with options: batch_id, download_file_path, use_anthropic. It tries to retrieve a batch job from either Anthropic or OpenAI API, checks if the job is completed, then obtains results URL (Anthropic) or output file ID (OpenAI). For OpenAI, it downloads the file content and writes to the specified path. For Anthropic, it logs the results URL and notes that download logic is not implemented. Errors are caught and logged.\n\nSo the summary: The command takes a batch job ID and a local file path, optionally using Anthropic API. It fetches the batch job status, ensures it's completed, then downloads the result file (OpenAI) or provides the results URL (Anthropic). The output is the file saved locally, or logs.\n\nLet's produce a Chinese summary. Ensure we start directly with the summary content. No preamble. Use Chinese. Possibly include English terms like \"batch_id\", \"download_file_path\". Provide business logic: retrieve batch job, check status, download file.\n\nLet's write:\n\n\"\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a CLI \u547d\u4ee4 `download_file`\uff0c\u63a5\u53d7 batch_id\u3001download_file_path\u3001use_anthropic \u4e09\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u6839\u636e use_anthropic \u51b3\u5b9a\u8c03\u7528 Anthropic \u6216 OpenAI \u7684\u6279\u5904\u7406\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u5bf9\u5e94 batch \u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u4ec5\u5f53\u72b6\u6001\u4e3a\u5df2\u5b8c\u6210\uff08Anthropic \u4e3a `ended`\uff0cOpenAI \u4e3a `completed`\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u5904\u7406\u3002OpenAI \u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bfb\u53d6 batch \u8f93\u51fa\u6587\u4ef6 ID\uff0c\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6587\u4ef6\u5185\u5bb9\u5e76\u5199\u5165 download_file_path\uff1bAnthropic \u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fd4\u56de results_url \u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u65e5\u5fd7\uff08\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0b\u8f7d\u903b\u8f91\u5f85\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\u3002\u82e5\u51fa\u73b0\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\u65e5\u5fd7\u3002\"\n\nThat should satisfy.
