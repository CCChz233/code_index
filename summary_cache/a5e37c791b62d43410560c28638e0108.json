{"summary": "- The code defines a test module for the `instructor` library, specifically testing the `distil` submodule.\n- It imports necessary modules and functions from `typing`, `pytest`, `instructor`, `openai`, and `pydantic`.\n- An `OpenAI` client is patched using `instructor.patch` to create a `client` instance.\n- An `Instructions` object is instantiated with the name `\"test_distil\"` and a sample function `test_function` is defined with type hints.\n- The `test_function` includes a docstring but is not implemented.\n- The overall test setup is prepared for testing functionality related to function signatures and parsing.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. They gave a code snippet and a summary they wrote. We need to produce a summary that meets the requirements:\n\n1. Start directly with the summary content. No \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\".\n2. Focus on the business logic, inputs, and outputs.\n3. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English).\n\nSo we need to produce a Chinese summary (maybe bilingual) that directly starts with the content, no preamble. Should describe business logic, inputs, outputs.\n\nThe code is a test file for instructor.distil. It imports modules, patches OpenAI client, creates Instructions object, defines a sample function with type hints. The test likely will later call functions like format_function, get_signature_from_fn, etc., but not shown. So summary: sets up test environment, defines a dummy function to test signature extraction and return type checking.\n\nInputs: none (just definitions). Outputs: none (test setup). But we can mention that the code prepares objects for later tests.\n\nLet's produce a concise Chinese summary. Ensure we start directly with the summary content, no \"\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f...\" etc. Just start with the summary.\n\nLet's do:\n\n\"\u4ee3\u7801\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3a `instructor` \u5e93\u7684 `distil` \u5b50\u6a21\u5757\u642d\u5efa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5f15\u5165 `typing`\u3001`pytest`\u3001`instructor`\u3001`openai`\u3001`pydantic` \u7b49\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7 `instructor.patch(OpenAI())` \u521b\u5efa\u5e76\u5305\u88c5\u4e00\u4e2a OpenAI \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b9e\u4f8b `client`\u3002\u63a5\u7740\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316 `Instructions`\uff0c\u540d\u79f0\u4e3a `test_distil`\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f20\u9012\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u968f\u540e\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u7c7b\u578b\u6ce8\u89e3\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u51fd\u6570 `test_function(a: int, b: str)", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:48:10.460739"}
