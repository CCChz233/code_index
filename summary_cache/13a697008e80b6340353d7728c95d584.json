{"summary": "- Retrieves a list of file objects from the OpenAI API, sorts them by creation time in descending order, and returns the sorted list. The function `get_files` has no input parameters and outputs a list of `openai.types.FileObject`. The code also sets up a command-line interface (CLI) using Typer and a console for rich text display. The `client` variable is initialized with an OpenAI API client.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. They gave a code snippet and a summary they wrote. They ask: \"Summarize the functionality of the following code. Requirements: 1. Start directly with the summary content. No 'This code does...' or 'Here is...' 2. Focus on the business logic, inputs, and outputs. 3. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English).\"\n\nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). Must start directly with the summary content, no preamble. So just start with the summary. Should mention business logic: retrieving files from OpenAI API, sorting by creation time descending, returning list. Also mention CLI setup with Typer and console for rich display. Input: none. Output: list of FileObject. Also mention that client is OpenAI API client.\n\nLet's produce a concise summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms like \"OpenAI API\", \"Typer\", \"Rich\". Ensure we start directly with the summary content. No \"This code does...\" etc. Let's produce.\n\nassistantfinal\u83b7\u53d6 OpenAI API \u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u5217\u8868 \u2192 \u6309 `created_at` \u964d\u5e8f\u6392\u5e8f \u2192 \u8fd4\u56de `list[openai.types.FileObject]`\u3002  \n\u51fd\u6570 `get_files` \u65e0\u8f93\u5165\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u5bf9\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u3002  \n\u4ee3\u7801\u540c\u65f6\u521d\u59cb\u5316 `OpenAI` \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef `client`\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e Typer \u7684 CLI \u5e94\u7528 `app`\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u5bcc\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\u7684 Rich `Console`\u3002", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:54:45.113329"}
