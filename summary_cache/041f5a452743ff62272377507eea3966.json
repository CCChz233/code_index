{"summary": "The script `doc_checker.py` is a documentation validation tool for the Modin project. It uses the `numpydoc` library to parse and validate the docstrings of Python modules, classes, and functions. The script defines a set of error codes (including both ****). \nThe ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ......\nWe need to produce a summary of functionality, focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs, in Chinese (or Chinese/English). Must start directly with summary content, no \"This code does...\" etc. So start with something like \"\u8be5\u811a\u672c\u7528\u4e8e...\" etc.\n\nWe need to summarize the code provided. The code includes imports, environment variable, constants, MODIN_ERROR_CODES, function check_spelling_words(doc: Validator) -> list. The function checks spelling of chosen words in doc. It returns list of tuples with error code and description. It uses regex to find words that are not in allowed components list. It also determines docstring start line via inspect.getsourcelines. It builds errors with MD02 code.\n\nThe overall script likely includes more functions (not shown) but we only have this part. So summarize that.\n\nInputs: a Validator object from numpydoc.validate, which contains raw_doc (docstring text), code_obj (the function/class object), source_file_def_line (line number where definition starts). Output: list of errors (error code, message). Business logic: check spelling of specific words (Modin, pandas, etc.) in docstring, ensure they are correctly capitalized? Actually it checks for words not matching the allowed components list? Let's read: components = set([...]) includes \"Modin\", \"pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"Ray\", \"Dask\", \"PyArrow\", \"XGBoost\", \"Plasma\". check_words = \"|\".join(x.lower() for x in components). Then pattern matches those words case-insensitively. Then results = [set(re.findall(pattern, line, re.I | re.VERBOSE)) - components for line in doc.raw_doc.splitlines()]. So it finds words that match the pattern (lowercase) and then subtracts components set (which contains capitalized forms). So any word that matches but not exactly equal to component (case-sensitive) will be considered a spelling error. Then for each such word, find reference (the correct component) by matching lowercased. Then produce error MD02 with line number (docstring_start_line + line_idx).
