{"summary": "The code defines a test case for a client that uses the `OpenAI` API (from `openai` library). \nThe test `test_client_...` creates an ****.\nThe test **...**.\nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English). The user gave a code snippet and a partial summary. We need to produce a final summary that meets the requirements:\n\n1. Start directly with the summary content. No \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\".\n2. Focus on the business logic, inputs, and outputs.\n3. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English).\n\nSo we need to summarize the functionality of the code: It's a test file for LLM client. It imports various libraries, defines a test function that creates an instructor client from OpenAI, calls chat.completions.create_with_completion with a response model User (but User is not defined in snippet; maybe defined elsewhere). It passes messages with a user content \"Jason is 10\". It asserts that the returned user model has name \"Jason\" and age 10, and that the raw completion is an instance of ChatCompletion.\n\nThus the summary: The test verifies that the instructor wrapper can parse a chat completion into a Pydantic model (User) and also return the raw OpenAI ChatCompletion object. Input: messages list, temperature, response_model. Output: user model and completion object.\n\nWe need to start directly with the summary content, no preamble. So just start with Chinese description.\n\nLet's produce a concise summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms for clarity.\n\nOk.assistantfinal\u8be5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e `openai` \u7684 LLM \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff08\u901a\u8fc7 `instructor.from_openai` \u5305\u88c5\uff09\u5728\u804a\u5929\u8865\u5168\u63a5\u53e3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\n\n- **\u8f93\u5165**\uff1a  \n  - `model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"` \u7684 OpenAI \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002  \n  - `messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Jason is 10\"}]`\uff0c\u5373\u7528\u6237\u53d1\u9001\u7684\u6587\u672c\u3002  \n  - `temperature=0`\uff08\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u3002  \n  - `response_model=User`\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ee7\u627f\u81ea `pydantic.BaseModel` \u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u6790\u8fd4\u56de\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u3002\n\n- **\u5904\u7406**\uff1a\u8c03\u7528 `client.chat.completions.create_with_completion`\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5185\u90e8\u5411 OpenAI \u53d1\u9001\u804a\u5929\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6536\u5230 `ChatCompletion` \u54cd\u5e94\u540e", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T21:00:11.602944"}
