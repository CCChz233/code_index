{"summary": "We need to summarize the functionality of the code snippet. The snippet is from aiohttp/payload.py. It defines imports, constants, and some class definitions? Actually the snippet ends with a property method _binary_headers. It defines constants: TOO_LARGE_BYTES_BODY = 2**20 (1 MB). It defines PayloadType alias, _PayloadRegistryItem, PAYLOAD_REGISTRY = PayloadRegistry() (presumably a registry for payload types). It defines default content type. It defines a property _binary_headers that returns the HTTP headers as bytes.\n\nBut the snippet is incomplete; many classes are referenced in __all__: Payload, BytesPayload, StringPayload, etc. The code defines imports and constants, but not the actual class definitions. However the request: \"Summarize the functionality of the following code.\" So we need to summarize what this module does: It provides payload handling for aiohttp, converting various data types (bytes, strings, file-like objects, JSON, async iterables) into HTTP request bodies, with appropriate headers and content type. It registers payload types, provides get_payload function to retrieve appropriate payload class based on input, and defines a base Payload class with methods for size, reading, etc. The snippet includes a property to generate binary headers.\n\nThus summary: The module defines a registry for payload types, constants, imports, and a property to format headers as bytes. It is part of aiohttp's payload handling system.\n\nWe need to follow the requirements: start directly with summary content, no \"This code does...\". Use Chinese (with English maybe). So we can write Chinese description of business logic, inputs, outputs.\n\nLet's produce a concise summary: The module defines a payload registry, default content type, size limit, and a property to convert header dict to bytes. It is used to wrap various data (bytes, str, file objects, JSON, async iterables) into a Payload object for HTTP requests/responses. The get_payload function (not shown) selects appropriate Payload subclass based on input type and optional content_type, encoding, etc. The Payload classes implement methods to compute size, write to stream, etc. The _binary_headers property returns the HTTP headers formatted as CRLF-separated bytes, used when sending binary payloads.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 aiohttp \u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u628a\u5404\u79cd Python \u5bf9\u8c61\u5305\u88c5\u6210 HTTP \u8bf7\u6c42/\u54cd\u5e94\u4f53\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u63a5\u53e3\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\n\n- **Payload \u6ce8\u518c\u8868**\uff1a`PAYLOAD_REGISTRY = PayloadRegistry()`", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:52:48.670391"}
