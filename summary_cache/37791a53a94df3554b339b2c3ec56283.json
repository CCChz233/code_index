{"summary": "The code defines a test case for a function `select_by_relative \nWe need to produce a summary of the functionality of the code. The code is a test file for a function select_by_relative_intensity. It imports Spectrum, select_by_relative_intensity, numpy, pytest. It defines a test function test_select_by_relative_intensity_with_to_parameter. It creates a spectrum with mz and intensities arrays. Then calls select_by_relative_intensity with intensity_to=0.99. Then asserts that the resulting spectrum has 3 peaks, that mz and intensities sizes match, and that the mz and intensities arrays equal expected values (first three peaks). So the test verifies that the function filters out peaks above a relative intensity threshold (0.99 of max intensity). The function likely removes peaks whose intensity relative to max is greater than intensity_to? Actually intensity_to=0.99 means keep peaks with relative intensity <=0.99? The max intensity is 1000, relative intensities: 0.001,0.01,0.1,1. So threshold 0.99 would drop the last peak (1 >0.99). So keep first three. So test verifies that.\n\nThus summary: The test checks that select_by_relative_intensity correctly filters a Spectrum by relative intensity threshold, removing peaks above the given proportion of the maximum intensity, and returns a Spectrum with matching mz and intensity arrays.\n\nNow produce summary in Chinese (with some English maybe).
