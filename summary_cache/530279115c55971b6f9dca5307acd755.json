{"summary": "- The test imports necessary modules and defines a test function `test_image_from_url`.\n- It creates a `Image` object from a URL using `Image.from_url` method.\n- It asserts that the `source` attribute of the image is the URL.\n- It asserts that `media_type` is `image/jpeg`.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the given code. The requirements: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English). So we need to produce a summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). The code is a test file for multimodal functionality. It imports pytest, Path, Image, convert_contents, convert_messages, Mode, patch, MagicMock. It defines a test function test_image_from_url. It sets a URL string, calls Image.from_url(url) to get an Image object, then asserts that image.source equals url, image.media_type equals \"image/jpeg\", and image.data is None.\n\nThus the summary: The test verifies that Image.from_url correctly constructs an Image instance with source set to the given URL, media_type inferred as image/jpeg, and data left empty (None). Input: a URL string. Output: an Image object with those attributes; the test asserts these conditions.\n\nWe need to produce the summary directly, no preamble. So something like:\n\n- \u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\uff1a\u6d4b\u8bd5 `Image.from_url` \u65b9\u6cd5...\n- \u8f93\u5165\uff1aURL \u5b57\u7b26\u4e32...\n- \u8f93\u51fa\uff1aImage \u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5c5e\u6027...\n\nWe can combine Chinese and English. Let's produce a concise summary. Ensure we start directly with the summary content. No \"This code does...\". So start with bullet points or sentences. Let's do bullet points. Use Chinese. Provide business logic, inputs, outputs. Let's do that.assistantfinal- \u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\uff1a\u9a8c\u8bc1 `instructor.multimodal.Image.from_url` \u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u56fe\u7247 URL \u6b63\u786e\u521b\u5efa `Image` \u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002  \n- \u8f93\u5165\uff1a`url = \"https://example.com/image.jpg\"`\uff08\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u94fe\u63a5\uff09\u3002  \n- \u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u8c03\u7528 `Image.from_url(url)`\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u5e94\u89e3\u6790 URL\u3001\u63a8\u65ad\u5a92\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u9ed8\u8ba4 `image/jpeg`\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b9e\u9645\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6570\u636e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a0\u8f7d\uff08`data` \u8bbe\u4e3a `None`\uff09\u3002  \n- \u8f93\u51fa/\u65ad\u8a00\uff1a\u8fd4\u56de\u7684 `Image` \u5bf9\u8c61\u6ee1\u8db3", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:49:56.240267"}
