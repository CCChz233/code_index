{"summary": "The code defines a multipart handling module for aiohttp, providing classes and functions to read and write multipart HTTP messages. It includes `MultipartReader` for parsing multipart bodies, `MultipartWriter` for constructing multipart messages, and `BodyPartReader` for reading individual parts. It handles content disposition parsing, filename extraction, and supports various payload types (JSON, string, etc.). The module also integrates compression utilities, header parsing, and utilities for MIME type handling. It defines constants, imports necessary modules, and sets up type hints and utility functions for multipart processing. The primary inputs are HTTP request/response bodies, and the outputs are parsed multipart components or constructed multipart messages. The code also includes error handling for malformed content disposition headers. The `__aiter__` method suggests asynchronous iteration over multipart parts.", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:48:33.254452"}
