{"summary": "The code defines a module for handling ZIP files, providing classes and functions for creating, reading, and manipulating ZIP archives. It includes constants for compression methods, ZIP format limits, and structures for parsing ZIP file headers. The main classes are `ZipInfo` (metadata for each file in the archive) and `ZipFile` (operations on ZIP archives). It supports different compression types (stored, deflated, bzip2, lzma) and handles ZIP64 extensions for large files. The module also defines error classes (`BadZipFile`, `BadZipfile`) and utility functions like `is_zipfile`. The `ZipInfo` class encodes filenames, handling ASCII and UTF-8 encoding based on content. The code sets up internal structures for reading and writing ZIP file headers, central directories, and end-of-archive records. It also includes compatibility handling for older Python versions.", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T21:02:05.786361"}
