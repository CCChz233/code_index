{"summary": "- The code defines a class method `tasks_from_chunks` that processes a stream of JSON strings (`json_chunks`) and extracts a sequence of `BaseModel` objects.\n- It uses ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````...\nWe need to summarize the functionality of the code snippet. The snippet is from instructor/dsl/iterable.py. It defines a class method tasks_from_chunks that processes JSON chunks from an iterable, extracts objects, validates them against a Pydantic BaseModel subclass (task_type), and yields them. It also uses a class variable task_type. It uses get_object method (not shown) to parse JSON objects from a string. It handles starting after encountering a '[' character, indicating a JSON array. It yields each parsed object as a BaseModel instance.\n\nWe need to produce summary in Chinese (with English optionally). Must start directly with summary content, no \"This code does...\". So start with something like \"\u8be5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86...\" or \"\u4ee3\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86...\" but not \"This code does\". Use Chinese. Provide business logic, inputs, outputs. So: \u8f93\u5165\u662f\u53ef\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5757\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u751f\u6210\u7684BaseModel\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002 It uses Pydantic validation. It expects task_type to be set to a subclass of BaseModel. It extracts JSON objects from a stream that may be a JSON array. It yields each validated model.\n\nLet's craft final answer.assistantfinal\u8be5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5 `tasks_from_chunks`\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece **\u53ef\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684 JSON \u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5757**\uff08`json_chunks: Iterable[str]`\uff09\u4e2d\u9010\u5757\u89e3\u6790\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6 **Pydantic `BaseModel` \u5b9e\u4f8b**\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5f62\u5f0f\u9010\u4e2a\u8fd4\u56de\u3002\n\n**\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91**  \n1. **\u6d41\u5f0f\u89e3\u6790**\uff1a\u904d\u5386 `json_chunks`\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5757\u7d2f\u52a0\u5230 `potential_object`\uff0c\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u51fa\u73b0 `[`\uff08JSON \u6570\u7ec4\u8d77\u59cb\u7b26\uff09\u540e\u5f00\u59cb\u6b63\u5f0f\u89e3\u6790\u3002  \n2. **\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d0\u53d6**\uff1a\u8c03\u7528\u540c\u7c7b\u7684 `get_object`\uff08\u672a\u5c55\u793a\uff09\u4ece\u7d2f\u8ba1\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u5b8c\u6574\u7684 JSON \u5bf9\u8c61 `task_json`\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:58:20.030938"}
