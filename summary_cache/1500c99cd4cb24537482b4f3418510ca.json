{"summary": "The test suite validates that the `handle_response_model` function correctly preserves non-English character descriptions in the system prompt across various modes (ANTHROPIC_JSON, JSON, MD_JSON, GEMINI_JSON, VERTEXAI_JSON). It defines a `User` model with Chinese field descriptions and checks that these descriptions appear in the generated system prompt both with and without an additional system message. The inputs are the `User` model, mode, optional system message, and user messages; the output is the system prompt containing the field descriptions.", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:49:42.850454"}
