{"summary": "The code defines a module for handling HTTP-related utilities in the aiohttp library. It imports various modules and defines constants, regular expressions, and utility functions. The module includes a class `BasicAuth` for handling basic authentication, a `ChainMapProxy` class for creating a proxy that maps multiple dictionaries. The code defines a `ETag` class for handling ETag headers. The `reify` function is imported from `propcache` to use its `under_cached_property` (i.e., `under_cached_property`). \nThe `HeadersMixin` class provides a mix-in that provides an ``?`` (the `...` ... ) \nWe need to summarize the functionality of the code snippet. The snippet includes imports, constants, regexes, and a method `_parse_content_type`. The request: \"Summarize the functionality of the following code. Requirements: 1. Start directly with the summary content. No 'This code does...' or 'Here is...' 2. Focus on the business logic, inputs, and outputs. 3. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English).\"\n\nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). Should start directly with the summary content, no preamble. Should focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. The code snippet is part of aiohttp/helpers.py, includes imports, constants, regexes, and a method `_parse_content_type`. The summary should describe that this module provides HTTP utilities, constants, regex patterns, and a method to parse Content-Type header into type and parameters.\n\nThus produce a concise Chinese summary: \"\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9b HTTP \u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e38\u91cf\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u3001\u89e3\u6790 Content-Type \u7b49\". Include inputs: raw header string, output: sets internal fields `_content_type` and `_content_dict`. Also mention other classes like BasicAuth, ChainMapProxy, ETag, reify, etc. But the snippet only shows part of the file, not full definitions. So summarizing that the code defines imports, constants, regexes, and a private method for parsing Content-Type header.\n\nLet's produce a Chinese summary. Ensure no \"This code does...\" etc. Just start with summary. Use Chinese. Provide business logic: parsing content type header, handling defaults, storing parsed values. Also mention that the module defines utilities for HTTP handling, authentication, ETag, etc.\n\nLet's write.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b HTTP \u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\n\n- **\u5e38", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:41:45.053805"}
