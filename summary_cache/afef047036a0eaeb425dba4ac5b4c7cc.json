{"summary": "We have a code snippet from aiohttp/multipart.py. It defines imports, __all__ list, and a function (async def release). The code includes a definition of a function `release` that is a async function that reads all the parts (like reading reading). The function is defined in the `BodyPartReader` class? The code snippet is incomplete but likely part of a class BodyPartReader. The function `release` is used to read all data from a multipart body part (like reading reading). It is a async function that reads all the chunk.\n\nThe code snippet includes a lot of imports and definitions. The main function is `release` which is an async function that reads all the data to void.\n\nThus, summarizing: The code defines a multipart handling module for aiohttp. It imports many utilities, defines __all__ and a function release. The release function reads all remaining data from a stream and discards it.\n\nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese.\n\nWe need to mention business logic: reading multipart body parts, discarding data.\n\nWe need to mention inputs: the BodyPartReader instance, chunk size.\n\nOutputs: discarding data, no return.\n\nThus: The code is part of aiohttp's multipart handling, providing a BodyPartReader class with a release method that reads and discards all remaining data from a multipart body part.\n\nWe need to mention that it uses async reading, chunk size 8192.\n\nThus: The code defines a release method that loops until EOF, reading chunks of size chunk_size (8192) and discarding them.\n\nThus: The code is used to release resources after reading a multipart part.\n\nThus: The code is part of a library for handling HTTP multipart requests/responses.\n\nThus: The code imports many modules for handling content types, compression, etc.\n\nThus: The code defines __all__ for exported symbols.\n\nThus: The code defines a type alias _Part.\n\nThus: The code defines a chunk_size constant.\n\nThus: The code defines an async release method that reads all remaining data from the body part.\n\nThus: The code is used to ensure that the underlying stream is fully consumed, releasing resources.\n\nThus: The code returns None.\n\nThus: The code is used in asynchronous context.\n\nThus: The code uses self._at_eof to check if end-of-file.\n\nThus: The code uses self.read_chunk to read a chunk.\n\nThus: The code uses while loop.\n\nThus: The code returns None.\n\nThus: The code is part of BodyPartReader", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:49:05.922532"}
