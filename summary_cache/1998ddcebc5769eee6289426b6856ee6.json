{"summary": "The provided code defines a payload handling framework for aiohttp, focusing on various payload types (like bytes, string, file-like objects, JSON, async iterables). It registers and implements various classes that implement the `write` method to serialize/\u00a0\u00a0... (the rest... )\"\n\nWe need to produce a summary of the functionality of the code. The code snippet is incomplete; it's a part of aiohttp/payload.py. It defines imports, constants, abstract base class Payload with abstract async write method, and a registry. The request: \"Summarize the functionality of the following code. Requirements: 1. Start directly with the summary content. No 'This code does...' or 'Here is...' 2. Focus on the business logic, inputs, and outputs. 3. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English).\"\n\nThus we need to produce a Chinese summary (maybe bilingual). Should describe that the module defines payload handling for aiohttp, registers payload types, provides get_payload function, etc. The code snippet includes imports, constants, abstract class, registry. So summary: It defines a payload registry, abstract Payload class with async write method, constants like TOO_LARGE_BYTES_BODY, default content type, etc. It also defines type aliases and imports helper functions. The business logic: handling different payload types for HTTP requests/responses, converting various Python objects to HTTP body streams, providing content type, length, etc. Input: various data types (bytes, str, file-like, JSON, async iterables). Output: serialized HTTP payload written to stream writer.\n\nThus produce a concise Chinese summary. Let's do that.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 aiohttp \u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u7684 **Payload** \u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\n\n- **Payload \u6ce8\u518c\u4e0e\u67e5\u627e**\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40 `PAYLOAD_REGISTRY`\uff08`PayloadRegistry` \u5b9e\u4f8b\uff09\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e00\u7ec4 `(PayloadClass, condition)` \u6620\u5c04\uff0c`payload_type` \u4e0e `get_payload` \u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u53d6\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684 Payload \u5b50\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0 \u201c\u5bf9\u8c61 \u2192 HTTP \u8d1f\u8f7d\u201d \u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\n\n- **\u62bd\u8c61\u57fa\u7c7b `Payload`**\uff1a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63a5\u53e3  \n  ```python\n  async def write(self, writer: AbstractStreamWriter) -> None\n  ```  \n  \u6240\u6709\u5177\u4f53 Payload \u5fc5\u987b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u8eab\u5185\u5bb9\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u540e\u5199\u5165 `AbstractStreamWriter`\uff08\u5373\u5e95\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b `content_type`, `size", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:53:09.154701"}
