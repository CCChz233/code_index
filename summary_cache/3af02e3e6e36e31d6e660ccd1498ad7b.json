{"summary": "The code defines a tracing module for aiohttp, a Python asynchronous HTTP client/server library. It imports necessary modules and defines a `TraceConfig` class with various trace event parameters. The `TraceConfig` class provides a property `on_connection_create_end` which returns a signal (a callback function) that can be used to monitor or debug the end of a connection creation.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. They gave a snippet of code from aiohttp/tracing.py. They want a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English). They also gave requirements: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese.\n\nWe need to produce a summary of the code's functionality: it's a tracing module for aiohttp, defines TraceConfig class, various trace event parameter classes, and a property on_connection_create_end returning a Signal for callbacks.\n\nWe need to mention inputs and outputs: the TraceConfig class is used to configure tracing; the property returns a Signal object that can be used to attach callbacks for the end of connection creation events. The code imports modules, defines __all__, defines a generic type variable, and defines a property.\n\nWe need to start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\". So start with something like \"\u63d0\u4f9b aiohttp \u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u914d\u7f6e...\" etc.\n\nLet's produce a concise summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms.\n\nWe need to mention business logic: tracing of HTTP client events, connection creation, DNS resolution, request/response lifecycle, etc. The snippet only shows part of the file, but we can infer the overall purpose.\n\nWe need to mention inputs: the TraceConfig class can be instantiated with optional callbacks; the property returns a Signal that expects callbacks with specific parameter types (TraceConnectionCreateEndParams). Output: the Signal object.\n\nLet's produce a summary.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b aiohttp \u5f02\u6b65 HTTP \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef/\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u5168\u94fe\u8def\u8ffd\u8e2a\u914d\u7f6e\u3002  \n- \u901a\u8fc7 `TraceConfig` \u7c7b\u96c6\u4e2d\u7ba1\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u56de\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u8bf7\u6c42\u5f00\u59cb/\u7ed3\u675f\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u961f\u5217\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u521b\u5efa\u3001DNS \u89e3\u6790\u3001\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5757\u53d1\u9001/\u63a5\u6536\u3001\u8bf7\u6c42\u5934\u53d1\u9001\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 `__all__` \u4e2d\u5bfc\u51fa\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u3002  \n- `TraceConfig` \u5185\u90e8\u7ef4\u62a4\u591a\u4e2a `Signal[_SignalCallback[...]]` \u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c`on_connection_create_end", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:37:49.121639"}
