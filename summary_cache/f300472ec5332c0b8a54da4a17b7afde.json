Summarize the functionality of the following code. Requirements: 1. Start directly with the summary content. No \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". 2. Focus on the business logic, inputs, and outputs. 3. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English). Code: ...\"\n\nThe code snippet is incomplete; it's a part of aiohttp/multipart.py. The user wants a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English) focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs. The summary should start directly with the content, no preamble.\n\nWe need to produce a concise summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). The code defines multipart handling for aiohttp: reading/writing multipart HTTP messages, parsing headers, handling content disposition, etc. It imports many modules, defines __all__, defines a function _read_headers that reads headers from a stream.\n\nWe need to summarize the functionality: reading multipart messages, parsing headers, handling payloads, etc.\n\nWe should mention inputs: a stream (self._content), output: CIMultiDictProxy of headers.\n\nWe can mention classes: MultipartReader, MultipartWriter, BodyPartReader, etc.\n\nWe need to start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\". So start with something like \"\u63d0\u4f9b\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406 HTTP multipart \u6d88\u606f\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c...\" etc.\n\nLet's produce a concise summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms.\n\nWe need to mention business logic: reading multipart data, parsing headers, handling payloads, compressing/decompressing, etc.\n\nOk, let's write.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b\u7528\u4e8e aiohttp \u6846\u67b6\u7684 multipart \u6d88\u606f\u5904\u7406\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\n\n- **MultipartReader**\uff1a\u4ece\u5f02\u6b65\u6d41 (`self._content`) \u8bfb\u53d6 multipart/form\u2011data \u6216 multipart/mixed \u8bf7\u6c42\u4f53\uff0c", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:50:43.917119"}
