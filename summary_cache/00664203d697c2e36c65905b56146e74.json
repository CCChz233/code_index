{"summary": "- This code defines a client-side WebSocket response class for aiohttp library.\n- It imports necessary modules and defines a default timeout configuration.\n- It includes a method `_cancel` that cancels the pong \nWe need to produce a summary of the functionality of the given code snippet. The snippet is part of aiohttp/client_ws.py. It defines imports, default timeout, and a method _cancel_pong_response_cb. The request: \"Summarize the functionality of the following code. Requirements: 1. Start directly with the summary content. No 'This code does...' or 'Here is...' 2. Focus on the business logic, inputs, and outputs. 3. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English).\"\n\nThus we need to produce a Chinese summary (maybe bilingual) describing the business logic, inputs, outputs. The code snippet is incomplete; we have imports, default timeout, and a method that cancels a pong response callback. So we can summarize that this module implements client-side WebSocket handling, including reading, writing, message types, error handling, timeouts, JSON encoding/decoding, etc. The method _cancel_pong_response_cb cancels a scheduled callback for pong response.\n\nWe need to mention inputs: the class likely has a _pong_response_cb attribute (a asyncio.TimerHandle). The method checks if it's not None, cancels it, and sets to None. Output: side effect of cancelling the callback.\n\nWe can also mention that DEFAULT_WS_CLIENT_TIMEOUT defines default timeout values for receiving and closing.\n\nThus produce a Chinese summary focusing on business logic: client WebSocket response handling, timeout config, cancellation of pong callback.\n\nLet's produce a concise Chinese summary with some English terms.\n\nWe must start directly with the summary content, no preamble. So start with \"\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0...\" etc.\n\nLet's produce.assistantfinal\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0 aiohttp \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef WebSocket \u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\n\n- **WebSocket \u8d85\u65f6\u914d\u7f6e**\uff1a`DEFAULT_WS_CLIENT_TIMEOUT` \u4e3a `ClientWSTimeout` \u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4 `ws_receive` \u4e3a `None`\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u8bf7\u6c42\u8d85\u65f6\uff09\uff0c`ws_close` \u4e3a 10 \u79d2\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5173\u95ed\u8fde\u63a5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5236\u8d85\u65f6\u9000\u51fa\u3002  \n- **pong \u54cd\u5e94\u56de\u8c03\u7ba1\u7406**\uff1a`_cancel_pong_response_cb` \u65b9\u6cd5\u63a5\u53d7\u5185\u90e8\u5c5e\u6027 `_pong_response_cb`\uff08`asyncio.TimerHandle`\uff09\uff0c\u82e5\u8be5\u56de\u8c03\u5df2\u6ce8\u518c\u5219\u8c03\u7528\u5176", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:34:14.760485"}
