{"summary": "The code defines a StreamResponse class for handling HTTP responses in an aiohttp web server. It imports necessary modules and defines constants and helper functions. The class has a write_eof method that writes the response body and ends the response. The method checks the type of data and validates the response. It uses a payload writer to write the data and then sets the response status and finalizes the final output.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. They gave a snippet of code from aiohttp/web_response.py. They want a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English). They also gave requirements: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese.\n\nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). The code defines StreamResponse class, imports many modules, defines constants, etc. The snippet includes __all__, CONTENT_CODINGS, __slots__, and a write_eof async method.\n\nWe need to summarize the functionality: handling HTTP responses, writing EOF, managing payload writer, tracking state, etc.\n\nWe need to mention inputs: data bytes, response object state, payload writer. Output: writes data to client, marks EOF, updates internal state.\n\nWe need to avoid \"This code does...\" and start directly with the summary.\n\nLet's produce a concise Chinese summary.\n\nPotential answer:\n\n\"\u5b9e\u73b0 aiohttp \u4e2d\u7684 StreamResponse \u7c7b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u53d1\u9001 HTTP \u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5305\u62ec\uff1a...\"\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u5b9e\u73b0 aiohttp \u6846\u67b6\u7684 **StreamResponse** \u7c7b\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u5e76\u53d1\u9001 HTTP \u54cd\u5e94\u3002  \n- **\u8f93\u5165**\uff1a`write_eof` \u65b9\u6cd5\u63a5\u6536\u53ef\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u5b57\u8282\u5bf9\u8c61 `data`\uff08bytes\u3001bytearray\u3001memoryview\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5185\u90e8\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001payload writer\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u6807\u8bb0\u7b49\u3002  \n- **\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91**\uff1a  \n  1. \u9a8c\u8bc1 `data` \u7c7b\u578b\u4e3a\u5b57\u8282\u7c7b\uff1b  \n  2. \u82e5\u5df2\u53d1\u9001 EOF \u5219\u76f4\u63a5\u8fd4\u56de\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u91cd\u590d\u5199\u5165\uff1b  \n  3. \u786e\u8ba4\u54cd\u5e94\u5df2\u542f\u52a8\uff08`_payload_writer` \u975e\u7a7a\uff09\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u629b\u51fa\u65ad\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\uff1b  \n  4. \u8c03\u7528\u5e95\u5c42 `payload_writer.write_eof(data)` \u5f02\u6b65\u5199\u5165\u5269\u4f59\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u7ed3\u675f\u6d41\uff1b  \n  5. \u66f4\u65b0\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff1a\u6807\u8bb0", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:56:50.492088"}
