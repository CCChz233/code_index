{"summary": "The code defines a module for handling WAV audio files, providing functions to open, read, and write WAV files. It defines constants for PCM format and extensible format, and a named tuple _wave_params for storing audio parameters (channels, sample width, frame rate, number of frames, compression type, and compression name). The _Chunk class includes a skip method that can be used to skip over the chunk \n```\n\n\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. They gave a snippet of code from Lib/wave.py, showing imports, __all__, constants, a namedtuple, and a skip method of a class _Chunk. They also gave a \"Summary:\" placeholder that says \"The code defines a module for handling WAV audio files, providing functions to open, read, and write WAV files. It defines constants for PCM format and extensible format, and a named tuple _wave_params for storing audio parameters (channels, sample width, frame rate, number of frames, compression type, and compression name). The _Chunk class includes a skip method that can be used to skip over the chunk\". The user wants us to \"Summarize the functionality of the following code.\" They gave requirements: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English). So we need to produce a summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). The summary should directly start with the content, not with \"This code does\". So we should start with something like \"\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0...\" or \"\u63d0\u4f9b...\" etc. Should mention the business logic: handling WAV files, opening, reading, writing, constants, namedtuple, skip method. Input: file object, chunk size, alignment. Output: skip to next chunk, raise errors. Should be concise. Use Chinese.\n\nThus produce a summary in Chinese. Possibly include English terms like \"WAV\", \"PCM\". Should not start with \"This code does\". Should start directly with the summary.\n\nLet's produce something like:\n\n\"\u63d0\u4f9b WAV \u97f3\u9891\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u6253\u5f00\u3001\u8bfb\u53d6\u3001\u5199\u5165\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49 PCM \u4e0e extensible \u683c\u5f0f\u5e38\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 _wave_params \u547d\u540d\u5143\u7ec4\u4fdd\u5b58\u58f0\u9053\u6570\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3001\u5e27\u7387\u3001\u5e27\u6570\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u540d\u79f0\u3002_Chunk \u7c7b\u7684 skip \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u4ef6\u672a\u5173\u95ed\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65f6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5df2\u8bfb\u53d6\u5b57\u8282\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u5269\u4f59\u5b57\u8282\u5e76", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:50:30.109335"}
