{"summary": "- The code defines a test module for partial DSL (Domain Specific Language) functionality using Pydantic models and the Instructor library.\n- It imports various modules and imports.\n- It defines a ********.\n```\n\n\nWe need to produce a summary of the functionality of the given code. The code snippet is incomplete; it's truncated. The user gave a snippet:\n\n```\ntests/dsl/test_partial.py from pydantic import BaseModel, Field from typing import Optional, Union from instructor.dsl.partial import Partial, PartialLiteralMixin import pytest import instructor from openai import OpenAI, AsyncOpenAI models = [\"gpt-4o-mini\"] modes = [     instructor.Mode.TOOLS, ]     async def async_generator():\n        for chunk in [\"\\n\", \"\\t\", \" \", '{\"b\": {\"b\": 1}}']:\n            yield chunk\n```\n\nIt seems truncated. The user wants a summary focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese. Start directly with summary content, no \"This code does...\". So we need to produce a Chinese summary of what the code does: It's a test file for partial DSL, using Pydantic models, testing partial literal mixin, async generator yields chunks, etc.\n\nWe need to infer the rest: The code likely defines tests for partial DSL, using models and modes, async generator yields JSON fragments, etc.\n\nWe can summarize: The test imports Pydantic BaseModel, Field, typing Optional, Union, Partial, PartialLiteralMixin from instructor.dsl.partial, pytest, instructor, OpenAI, AsyncOpenAI. It defines a list of models [\"gpt-4o-mini\"] and modes [instructor.Mode.TOOLS]. It defines an async generator that yields string chunks including whitespace and a JSON snippet. The test probably checks that the partial DSL can handle streaming partial JSON responses, merging them into a Pydantic model, etc.\n\nThus summary: This test module sets up environment for testing partial DSL, defines a generator to simulate streaming partial JSON, uses instructor library to run a model in tool mode, expects to parse partial responses into Pydantic models.\n\nWe need to mention inputs: models list, modes list, async_generator yields chunks. Output: likely a parsed Pydantic model.\n\nThus produce Chinese summary.\n\nLet's write:\n\n- \u4ee3\u7801\u4f4d\u4e8e tests/dsl/test_partial.py\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1 instructor.dsl.partial \u4e2d\u7684 Partial \u4e0e PartialLiteralMixin \u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\n- \u5f15\u5165 Pydantic BaseModel\u3001Field", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:59:26.840213"}
