{"summary": "We need to summarize the functionality of the code snippet. The snippet is from aiohttp/web_response.py. It imports many modules, defines constants, __all__, etc. It defines a class? Actually we see __slots__ defined, and _body variable. There's a __delitem__ method. So likely part of StreamResponse class. The code snippet is incomplete but we can infer that the file defines StreamResponse, Response, json_response, ContentCoding enum, etc. The business logic: handling HTTP responses in aiohttp, managing headers, cookies, payload, compression, chunked encoding, keep-alive, etc. Input: request object, status, headers, body/payload. Output: HTTP response sent over network via async writer.\n\nWe need to summarize functionality focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese. Provide summary directly.\n\nLet's craft a concise summary: The module implements HTTP response handling for aiohttp server/client. It defines ContentCoding enum for compression (gzip, deflate, br). StreamResponse class encapsulates response state: status code, reason phrase, headers, cookies, body/payload, chunked transfer, keep-alive, compression options, length checks. It provides methods to set headers, cookies, body, start sending, write chunks, finalize. It can automatically compress payload based on Accept-Encoding, manage content-length, ETag, conditional responses. json_response helper creates JSON payload with proper content-type and encoding.\n\nInputs: request object (optional), status code, reason, headers dict, body (bytes, bytearray, Payload), compression settings, chunked flag, keep-alive flag. Outputs: an HTTP response streamed to client via AbstractStreamWriter, with proper HTTP/1.0 or 1.1 formatting, headers, optional cookies, body data, possibly compressed.\n\nLet's produce Chinese summary.assistantfinal\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 aiohttp \u6846\u67b6\u7684 HTTP \u54cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\n\n- **ContentCoding \u679a\u4e3e**\uff1a\u5b9a\u4e49\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08gzip\u3001deflate\u3001br\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ece\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5230\u679a\u4e3e\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u8868 `CONTENT_CODINGS`\uff0c\u4f9b\u540e\u7eed\u538b\u7f29\u51b3\u7b56\u4f7f\u7528\u3002  \n- **StreamResponse \u7c7b**\uff08\u901a\u8fc7 `__slots__` \u9650\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\uff1a\u5c01\u88c5\u4e00\u6b21\u5b8c\u6574\u7684 HTTP \u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u7ba1\u7406\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5173\u952e\u72b6\u6001  \n  - `_status` / `_reason`\uff1a\u54cd\u5e94\u7801\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u77ed\u8bed\uff08\u9ed8\u8ba4\u53d6\u81ea `http.HTTPStatus`", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:57:06.748372"}
