{"summary": "The code defines a module for handling multipart HTTP requests and responses in an asynchronous environment using aiohttp. It includes classes and functions for parsing and constructing multipart messages, handling content disposition headers, and managing payloads. The module provides utilities for encoding, decoding, and compressing data, as well as handling various content types and encodings. It also defines custom exceptions for handling errors related to content disposition headers. The main classes are `MultipartReader` for reading multipart messages, `MultipartWriter` for writing multipart messages, and `BodyPartReader` for reading individual parts of a multipart message. The module also includes helper functions for parsing content disposition headers and extracting filenames. The code imports various utilities and types from other aiohttp modules and standard Python libraries. The `__all__` variable defines the public API of the module. The `__aiter__` method is defined for asynchronous iteration over multipart responses.", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:48:12.059317"}
