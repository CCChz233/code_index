{"summary": "The code defines a function `vertexai` ... ... ... etc...\n\nThe code defines a function `vertexai_message_parser` that parses a message dictionary into a `gm.Content` object for Vertex AI. It supports message content as a string or a list of strings/`gm.Part` objects, converting them into appropriate `gm.Part` instances. If the content type is unsupported, it raises a `ValueError`. The function returns a `gm.Content` object with the role and parts derived from the input message.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"function\",\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` \n```\n\n``````````````````\n\nThe provided JSON snippet appears to be malformed and incomplete.
