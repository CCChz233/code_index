Use Chinese (maybe mixed Chinese/English). Must start directly with summary content, no preamble. So just start with description.\n\nWe need to analyze the code snippet. It's a file \"instructor/multimodal.py\". It imports from __future__ annotations, imports Mode from .mode, base64, re, collections.abc Mapping, Hashable, functools lru_cache, typing (Any, Callable, Literal, Optional, Union, TypedDict, TypeVar, cast), pathlib Path, urllib.parse urlparse, mimetypes, requests, pydantic BaseModel, Field. Then defines type variables F, K, V. VALID_MIME_TYPES list. CacheControlType mapping. OptionalCacheControlType optional.\n\nThen defines a Pydantic model? It shows \"source: Union[str, Path] = Field(...)\" and \"media_type: str = Field(...)\" and \"data: Union[str, None] = Field(None, ...)\" and a classmethod is_base64.\n\nBut the snippet is incomplete; we only see part of a class definition. Probably a Pydantic model for image input. The code likely validates image source (URL, file path, base64) and ensures MIME type is valid. It may fetch image data from URL or read file, decode base64, etc. The is_base64 method checks if a string starts with data:image/...;base64,. So the business logic: handling multimodal image inputs for an instructor system.\n\nWe need to summarize functionality: It defines a data model for image input, validates source, determines MIME type, optionally stores base64 data, provides utility to detect base64 strings. It may also include caching for requests.\n\nBut we only have part of code. So summarizing based on visible parts: The code defines constants for valid MIME types, type aliases for cache control, and a Pydantic model (maybe named Image) with fields source, media_type, data, and a classmethod is_base64 to check base64 format.\n\nThus summary: This module provides utilities for handling multimodal image inputs, including validation of source (URL, file path, base64), MIME type checking, base64 detection, and possibly fetching image data with caching.\n\nLet's produce Chinese summary.\n\nWe need to mention inputs: source (string or", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:37:00.683708"}
