{"summary": "The code defines a multipart handling module for aiohttp, providing classes and functions to read and write multipart HTTP messages. It includes a `MultipartReader` for parsing multipart bodies, a `MultipartWriter` for constructing multipart messages, and a `BodyPartReader` for reading individual parts. The module handles content disposition parsing, filename extraction, and supports various payload types (JSON, string, etc.). It also integrates compression utilities and header parsing. The primary inputs are HTTP request/response streams, and the outputs are parsed multipart components or constructed multipart bodies ready for transmission. The module ensures proper handling of content types, encodings, and multipart boundaries.", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:49:55.761157"}
