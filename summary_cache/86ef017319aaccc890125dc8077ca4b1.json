{"summary": "The code defines a TraceConfig class in the aiohttp/tracing.py module. It imports necessary modules and defines a list of exported symbols. The class includes a property called \"on_response_chunk_received\" which returns a Signal object. This Signal object is used to handle the event of receiving a response chunk.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. They gave a snippet of code from aiohttp/tracing.py. The code includes imports, __all__ list, a generic type variable, and a property definition for on_response_chunk_received returning a Signal. The summary should focus on business logic, inputs, outputs, in Chinese (or Chinese/English). Should start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" etc. So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms. Should mention that TraceConfig is used for tracing events in aiohttp client, allowing users to attach callbacks to various request lifecycle events, such as request start, end, exception, connection events, DNS resolution, redirects, chunk sent/received, etc. The property on_response_chunk_received returns a Signal that can be used to register callbacks that receive TraceResponseChunkReceivedParams when a response chunk is received. The inputs are the callbacks; the output is the Signal object. The business logic is to provide a tracing configuration for aiohttp client requests.\n\nLet's produce a summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms. Ensure we start directly with the summary content. No \"This code does...\".
