{"summary": "We have a Python module defining an AsyncInstructor class that ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... \nWe need to summarize the functionality of the code. The code snippet is incomplete; it only shows imports and the beginning of a class definition. The class AsyncInstructor is defined with __init__ method that takes client, create function, mode, provider, hooks, and other kwargs. It sets attributes accordingly. The code also imports many modules: openai, inspect, instructor, utils, etc. It defines type variables and imports for typing. It also imports tenacity for retrying. It defines T = TypeVar bound to BaseModel, Iterable, Partial. It defines global variables: client, create_fn, mode, default_model, provider, hooks. Then class AsyncInstructor with __init__.\n\nThus the summary: This module provides an asynchronous instructor wrapper for OpenAI API calls, supporting different providers, modes (tools), hooks for pre/post processing, and retry logic. It takes a client (e.g., OpenAI client), a creation function (like openai.ChatCompletion.create), mode (tools or other), provider enum, optional hooks, and additional kwargs. It stores these for later use. The class likely implements async methods to call the API, handle partial responses, parse into pydantic models, and manage retries.\n\nWe need to output summary in Chinese (with English optional). Must start directly with summary content, no preamble.\n\nLet's produce a concise summary.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f02\u6b65\u8c03\u7528 OpenAI\uff08\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u517c\u5bb9\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c01\u88c5\u7c7b **AsyncInstructor**\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\n\n- **\u8f93\u5165**\uff1a  \n  - `client`\uff1a\u5b9e\u9645\u7684 API \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff08\u5982 `openai.AsyncOpenAI`\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a `None` \u65f6\u5185\u90e8\u81ea\u884c\u521b\u5efa\u3002  \n  - `create`\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u8d77\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982 `client.chat.completions.create`\uff09\uff0c\u7531\u8c03\u7528\u65b9\u6ce8\u5165\u3002  \n  - `mode`\uff1a`instructor.Mode` \u679a\u4e3e\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4 `TOOLS`\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u8fd4\u56de\u503c\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u666e\u901a\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7b49\uff09\u3002  \n  - `provider`\uff1a`Provider` \u679a\u4e3e\uff0c\u6807\u8bc6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5546\uff08\u9ed8\u8ba4 `OPENAI`\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002  \n  - `hooks`\uff1a`Hooks` \u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u53ef\u6ce8\u518c `", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:36:07.919471"}
