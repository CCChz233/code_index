{"summary": "The code defines a StreamResponse class for handling HTTP responses in an aiohttp web server. It imports necessary modules and defines constants and helper functions. The class has various attributes and methods for managing response headers, status, cookies, and body content. It also includes functionality for compression and chunked transfer encoding. The class provides methods for setting and retrieving the response status, body, and headers. It also supports JSON serialization and provides a json_response function for creating a JSON response. The code also defines a ContentCoding enum for handling content encoding.\n\nThe code defines a `StreamResponse` class for handling HTTP responses in an aiohttp web server.
