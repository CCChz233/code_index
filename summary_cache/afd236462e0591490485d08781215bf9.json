{"summary": "The test creates two mass spectra (Spectrum objects) with m/z and intensity arrays, normalizes their intensities, then computes a greedy cosine similarity using a tolerance of 0.2 Da. The CosineGreedy algorithm returns a similarity score and the number of matched peaks (2). The test asserts that the score approximates 0.081966 and that exactly 2 peaks are matched. Inputs: two spectra, tolerance parameter. Output: cosine similarity score and match count, validated by assertions.", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:36:57.650934"}
