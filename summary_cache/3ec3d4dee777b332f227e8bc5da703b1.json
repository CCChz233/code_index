It reads training and test CSV files, applies one-hot encoding, handles missing values, and creates new features such as age, credit-to-income ratios, and polynomial interactions. It aligns train and test datasets, splits anomalous and non-anomalous records based on employment days, and computes correlation matrices. The pipeline includes scaling and imputation, followed by training logistic regression, random forest, and LightGBM models. Predictions are generated for the test set, and feature importances are visualized. The final output includes submission files with predicted probabilities for the target variable.\n\n```\n\nThe code performs a comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training pipeline for a Kaggle competition dataset.
