Must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" etc. So we need to produce a concise description of what the code does: defines Application class for aiohttp, its initialization, attributes, signals, middlewares, router, state, subapps, cleanup context, client_max_size, etc. Also mention that debug argument is deprecated. Provide inputs: logger, middlewares, handler_args, client_max_size, debug. Outputs: an Application instance ready to register routes, middlewares, subapps, signals, etc. Also mention that the class uses frozenlist for middlewares, signals for lifecycle events, etc.\n\nLet's craft a Chinese summary:\n\n- \u5b9a\u4e49 aiohttp \u7684\u6838\u5fc3 Application \u7c7b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u7ba1\u7406 Web \u5e94\u7528\u3002\n- \u6784\u9020\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u53d7 logger\u3001middlewares\u3001handler_args\u3001client_max_size\u3001debug \u53c2\u6570\u3002\n- \u521d\u59cb\u5316 URL \u8def\u7531\u5206\u53d1\u5668\u3001\u65e5\u5fd7\u8bb0\u5f55\u5668\u3001middlewares\uff08\u51bb\u7ed3\u5217\u8868\uff09\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u5b57\u5178\u3001\u5b50\u5e94\u7528\u5217\u8868\u3001\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08on_startup\u3001on_shutdown\u3001on_cleanup\u3001on_response_prepare\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u6e05\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\n- debug \u53c2\u6570\u5df2\u5e9f\u5f03\uff0c\u4ec5\u53d1\u51fa DeprecationWarning\u3002\n- client_max_size \u7528\u4e8e\u9650\u5236\u8bf7\u6c42\u4f53\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4 1\u202fMiB\u3002\n- \u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u540e\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5904\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u5408\uff0crun_middlewares \u6807\u8bb0\u662f\u5426\u5728\u8bf7\u6c42\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u3002\n- \u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u5e94\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u952e\u503c\u5b58\u53d6\uff08AppKey\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b50\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6302\u8f7d\u673a\u5236\u3002\n- \u901a\u8fc7 Signal \u5bf9\u8c61\u5b9e\u73b0\u542f\u52a8\u3001\u5173\u95ed\u3001\u6e05\u7406\u7b49\u94a9\u5b50\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u6ce8\u518c\u56de\u8c03\u3002\n\nOutputs:", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T21:02:41.260643"}
