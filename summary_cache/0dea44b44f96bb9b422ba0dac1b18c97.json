They gave a snippet of a Python file `modin/conftest.py`. The code includes imports, some configuration, and a pytest fixture `TestReadCSVFixture`. The user wants a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English). They also gave some instructions: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese.\n\nThus we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese describing what the code does: defines a pytest fixture that creates temporary CSV files for testing Modin's CSV reading, using various configurations (regular, boolean values, blank lines, custom NaNs, bad lines). It uses `tmp_path_factory` to create a temporary directory, uses `_make_csv_file` to generate CSV files, stores file names in `pytest.csvs_names` dict, yields control to tests. The fixture is scoped to class.\n\nWe should also mention that the code imports many modules, sets up some configuration, but the core business logic is the fixture.\n\nThus produce a Chinese summary. Possibly include some English terms like \"pytest fixture\". The summary should be direct, no filler.\n\nLet's produce something like:\n\n```\n\u529f\u80fd\u6982\u8ff0\uff1a\n- \u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86 pytest \u7684 class \u4f5c\u7528\u57df fixture `TestReadCSVFixture`\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5 Modin CSV \u8bfb\u53d6\u529f\u80fd\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u65f6 CSV \u6587\u4ef6\u3002\n- \u901a\u8fc7 `tmp_path_factory.mktemp` \u521b\u5efa", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:40:45.115637"}
