{"summary": "The code defines a test case for a function `repair` ... etc.\n\nWe need to produce a summary of the functionality of the code. The code is a test file for a function `repair_inchi_inchikey_smiles` from matchms.filtering. It creates a Spectrum object with empty mz and intensities arrays, and metadata containing an inchikey. Then it calls the repair function, and asserts that the returned spectrum is a new object (not the same as input), and that the metadata fields \"inchi\", \"inchikey\", and \"smiles\" are as expected: inchi empty string, inchikey unchanged, smiles empty string.\n\nThus the test verifies that when only inchikey is provided, the repair function returns a new Spectrum with empty inchi and smiles fields.\n\nWe need to summarize the functionality: The test checks that the repair function correctly handles a spectrum with only an InChIKey, ensuring that the output spectrum is a new object and that missing InChI and SMILES fields are set to empty strings while preserving the InChIKey.\n\nWe need to output in Chinese (with possibly some English terms). The summary should focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. No \"This code does...\" etc. So start directly with the summary content.\n\nThus: \"\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1 `repair_inchi_inchikey_smiles` \u5728\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b InChIKey \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u521b\u5efa\u7684 Spectrum \u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u539f\u59cb InChIKey \u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c`inchi` \u4e0e `smiles` \u5b57\u6bb5\u88ab\u586b\u5145\u4e3a\u7a7a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3002\" Something like that.\n\nMake sure to mention inputs: a Spectrum with empty mz/intensities and metadata containing inchikey.
