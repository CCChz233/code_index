{"summary": "The code defines a module for handling wave audio files. It imports necessary modules and defines constants for wave format types. It also defines a named tuple `_wave_params` to store wave file parameters such as number of channels, sample width, frame rate, number of frames, compression type, and compression name. The `__enter__` method is defined for use in a context manager. The module provides functions `open`, `Error`, `Wave_read`, and `Wave_write` to read and write wave files. The code does not contain any specific implementation details.\n\n\u8be5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u6ce2\u5f62\u97f3\u9891\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u5b83\u5bfc\u5165\u4e86\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u6ce2\u5f62\u683c\u5f0f\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5e38\u91cf\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a `_wave_params` \u7684\u547d\u540d\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u6ce2\u5f62\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5982\u901a\u9053\u6570\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3001\u5e27\u7387\u3001\u5e27\u6570\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u540d\u79f0\u3002`__enter__` \u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 `open`\u3001`Error`\u3001`Wave_read` \u548c `Wave_write` \u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bfb\u53d6\u548c\u5199\u5165\u6ce2\u5f62\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\n\n```python\ndef function1():\n    # 1.\n  ****** **** **** **** \n**** ** **** **\n\nIt looks like the code snippet you provided is incomplete and contains placeholders or formatting symbols that don't represent valid Python syntax.
