{"summary": "The code defines a module `aiohttp.helpers` that provides various utility functions and classes for the aiohttp library. It imports several modules and defines a number of constants and functions. The module includes a `BasicAuth` class for handling authentication.\nThe code defines a ``...`...`......... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... \nWe need to summarize functionality of the code snippet. The snippet is a part of aiohttp/helpers.py. It includes imports, constants, type variables, sentinel, etc. It defines __all__ = (\"BasicAuth\", \"ChainMapProxy\", \"ETag\", \"reify\"). It defines some constants like COOKIE_MAX_LENGTH, EMPTY_BODY_STATUS_CODES, etc. It defines a class with __slots__ = (\"_loop\", \"_tasks\", \"_cancelled\", \"_cancelling\") and a method assert_timeout that raises TimeoutError if timer cancelled. The snippet seems incomplete; only part of TimerContext class? The code includes many imports and definitions but the core functionality is not fully shown. The summary should focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. The code provides helper utilities for aiohttp: authentication handling, ETag parsing, cookie handling, datetime caching, etc. The TimerContext class likely used to manage timeouts for async operations.\n\nThus summary: This module provides helper utilities for aiohttp: BasicAuth for HTTP basic authentication, ChainMapProxy for read-only mapping, ETag parsing and matching, reify decorator for cached properties, functions for handling cookies, parsing dates, generating headers, managing proxies, etc. It also defines constants for empty body status codes, methods, debug mode, token characters, regex for JSON content types, etc. The TimerContext class (partial) tracks async tasks and can assert timeout.\n\nWe need to output in Chinese (with English maybe). Provide summary directly.\n\nLet's craft a concise summary.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b aiohttp \u6846\u67b6\u5185\u90e8\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u5408\u3002  \n- **\u6838\u5fc3\u7c7b**  \n  - `BasicAuth`\uff1a\u5c01\u88c5 HTTP Basic \u8ba4\u8bc1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63a5\u53d7\u7528\u6237\u540d\u3001\u5bc6\u7801\u53ca\u53ef\u9009\u5b57\u7b26\u96c6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408 RFC\u202f7617 \u7684 `Authorization` \u5934\u90e8\u503c\u3002  \n  - `ChainMapProxy`\uff08\u5728 `__all__` \u4e2d\u5bfc\u51fa\uff09\uff1a\u53ea\u8bfb\u5305\u88c5\u591a\u4e2a\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u53e0\u67e5\u627e\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u5e76\u8bf7\u6c42/\u54cd\u5e94\u7684 header\u3001cookie \u7b49\u5b57\u5178\u3002  \n  - `ETag`\uff1a\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u5339\u914d HTTP ETag\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f31\u6807\u7b7e (`", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:41:22.158982"}
