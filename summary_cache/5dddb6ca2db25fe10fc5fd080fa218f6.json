{"summary": "The code defines a function ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````...... ... ... ... ...... ... ... \n\nWe need to summarize the functionality of the code snippet. The snippet is from instructor/client_gemini.py. It imports __future__ annotations, typing.Any, Literal, overload, google.generativeai as genai, instructor. Then defines an overload function from_gemini with signature:\n\ndef from_gemini(\n    client: genai.GenerativeModel,\n    mode: instructor.Mode = instructor.Mode.GEMINI_TOOLS,\n    use_async: Literal[True] = True,\n    **kwargs: Any,\n) -> instructor.AsyncInstructor: ...\n\nSo it's just a type hint overload for a function that returns an AsyncInstructor when use_async True. The code snippet only includes the overload definition, not the implementation. So the summary: It provides a type signature for a factory function that creates an asynchronous instructor wrapper around a Gemini GenerativeModel client, defaulting to GEMINI_TOOLS mode and async usage.\n\nThus the business logic: It defines a function that takes a Gemini client, optional mode, optional async flag (must be True for this overload), and additional kwargs, and returns an AsyncInstructor. The function likely wraps the client for tool usage.\n\nThus the summary: The function `from_gemini` is a factory that creates an instructor instance (async) from a Google Gemini GenerativeModel, with default mode GEMINI_TOOLS, and async enabled.\n\nWe need to output in Chinese (with English optionally). So we can write Chinese description.\n\nWe must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" etc. So start with something like:\n\n\"\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a `from_gemini` \u5de5\u5382\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u91cd\u8f7d\uff0c\u63a5\u53d7 `genai.GenerativeModel` \u5b9e\u4f8b\u3001\u53ef\u9009\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f `instructor.Mode`\uff08\u9ed8\u8ba4 `GEMINI_TOOLS`\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f3a\u5236\u4e3a `True` \u7684 `use_async` \u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de `instructor.AsyncInstructor` \u5bf9\u8c61\u3002\"\n\nThat covers business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese. Possibly mention that it's an overload for async usage.\n\nThus final answer.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b `from_gemini` \u5de5\u5382\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u91cd\u8f7d\uff1a\u63a5\u53d7 `genai.GenerativeModel` \u5b9e\u4f8b `client`\u3001\u53ef\u9009\u7684 `mode`\uff08\u9ed8\u8ba4 `instructor.Mode", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:41:53.026840"}
