{"summary": "- This module defines constants, structures, and classes for handling ZIP files, including support for various compression methods (stored, deflated, bzip2, lzma). It provides functionality to read, write, and manipulate ZIP archives, including handling of ZIP64 extensions for large files. The module also defines error classes and utility functions for checking if a file is a ZIP archive. The LZMACompressor class is initialized with a specific filter configuration.\n- The code includes a function `_init` that creates a LZMA compressor (LZMACompressor) using the LZMA library.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. Must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" etc. Must focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English). So we need to produce a summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). Provide concise description of what the module does: defines constants, structures for ZIP file handling, error classes, compression method mapping, LZMA compressor initialization, etc. Also mention inputs/outputs: functions accept file-like objects, return ZipFile objects, etc. But the provided snippet only includes definitions and an _init method for LZMACompressor. So summarizing that.\n\nWe need to start directly with the summary content. So no preamble. Provide Chinese description. Let's produce.\n\nAlso note that the code defines __all__ list, constants like ZIP_STORED, ZIP_DEFLATED, etc., structures for end of central directory, central directory header, file header, ZIP64 structures, masks, extra field struct, compressor_names mapping, dedupe dict, and a class LZMACompressor with _init method that creates an LZMA compressor with raw format and returns header bytes.\n\nThus summary: module provides ZIP file handling, compression support, error handling, utility functions, and LZMA compressor initialization.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b ZIP \u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8bfb\u5199\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u652f\u6301\u3002  \n- **\u5e38\u91cf\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784**\uff1a\u5b9a\u4e49 ZIP\u3001ZIP64\u3001BZIP2\u3001LZMA \u7b49\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u6807\u8bc6\u3001\u7248\u672c\u53f7\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u9650\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u4f53\uff08\u7ed3\u675f\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u76ee\u5f55\u3001\u6587\u4ef6\u5934\u3001ZIP64 \u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6587\u4ef6\u6d41\u4e2d\u89e3\u6790\u6216\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5b57\u8282\u5757\u3002  \n- **\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b**\uff1a`BadZipFile`\uff08\u522b\u540d `BadZipfile`\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u89e3\u6790\u6216\u64cd\u4f5c", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T21:02:45.007658"}
