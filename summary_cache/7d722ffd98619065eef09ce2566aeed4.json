{"summary": "The test verifies ****...\n\nThe test verifies that the `normalize_intensities` function correctly scales the intensity values of a mass spectrum so that the maximum intensity becomes 1.0, while preserving the original m/z (mass-to-charge ratio) values. It creates a `Spectrum` object with predefined m/z and intensity arrays, applies the normalization, and asserts that the maximum intensity after normalization is exactly 1.0 and that the m/z values remain unchanged. This ensures the function's correctness in scaling intensities without altering the spectral positions.\n\n```json\n{\n {\"{\"{\"{\"{\"{\" \n{\"{\"{\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0JSON?\n\nIt looks like the JSON input you provided is malformed and contains a lot of extraneous characters and whitespace.
