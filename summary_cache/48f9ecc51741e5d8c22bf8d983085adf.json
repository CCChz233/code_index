{"summary": "The code defines a ```````````````````.............................. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... \nWe need to summarize functionality of given code snippet. The snippet is incomplete and garbled. Let's read it.\n\n```\naiohttp/resolver.py AsyncResolver import asyncio import socket from typing import Any, List, Tuple, Type, Union from .abc import AbstractResolver, ResolveResult __all__ = (\"ThreadedResolver\", \"AsyncResolver\", \"DefaultResolver\") _NUMERIC_SOCKET_FLAGS = socket.AI_NUMERICHOST | socket.AI_NUMERICSERV _NAME_SOCKET_FLAGS = socket.NI_NUMERICHOST | socket.NI_NUMERICSERV _DefaultType = Type[Union[AsyncResolver, ThreadedResolver]] DefaultResolver: _DefaultType = AsyncResolver if aiodns_default else ThreadedResolver     async def close(self) -> None:\n        self._resolver.cancel()\n```\n\nIt seems truncated. It defines AsyncResolver, ThreadedResolver, DefaultResolver. It sets socket flags for numeric host and service. It defines a type alias _DefaultType as Union of AsyncResolver and ThreadedResolver. Then DefaultResolver is set to AsyncResolver if aiodns_default else ThreadedResolver. Then defines async close method that cancels resolver.\n\nThus summary: The module provides DNS resolver abstractions for aiohttp, supporting async and threaded resolution. It defines constants for socket flags, a type alias for default resolver, selects default resolver based on aiodns availability, and implements a close method to cancel ongoing resolution tasks.\n\nInputs: likely hostnames, ports, etc. Output: ResolveResult objects.\n\nThus answer in Chinese.
