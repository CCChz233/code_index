{"summary": "The code defines a `PartialBase` class that provides a static asynchronous method `extract_json_async`. This method takes a `completion` asynchronous generator (which returns ``````) and a `mode` parameter.

The code snippet is incomplete but includes imports and a static async method extract_json_async that yields JSON chunks based on mode. The summary should be in Chinese (with possible English). Should start directly with summary content, no preamble. Should focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. So we need to describe that the method processes streaming responses from various LLM APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) and extracts JSON fragments according to the mode (e.g., ANTHROPIC_JSON, FUNCTION_CALL, etc.) and yields them as strings. It handles different structures of the response (delta.text, partial_json, function_call.arguments, content, tool_calls). It catches AttributeError and continues. It raises NotImplementedError for unsupported modes.\n\nAlso mention that the class is part of a DSL for partial model extraction, using Pydantic models.\n\nLet's craft a concise summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms.\n\nStart directly with summary content.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a `PartialBase` \u62bd\u8c61\u7c7b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u662f **\u5f02\u6b65\u63d0\u53d6\u6d41\u5f0f LLM \u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684 JSON \u7247\u6bb5**\u3002  \n\n- **\u8f93\u5165**  \n  1. `completion: AsyncGenerator[Any, None]` \u2013 \u7531\u6a21\u578b\uff08OpenAI\u3001Anthropic\u3001Fireworks \u7b49\uff09\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a `chunk` \u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b57\u6bb5\u7ed3\u6784\uff08`delta.text`\u3001`delta.partial_json`\u3001`choices[0].delta.*` \u7b49\uff09\u3002  \n  2. `mode: Mode` \u2013 \u6307\u5b9a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd4\u56de\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982 `ANTHROPIC_JSON`\u3001`ANTHROPIC_TOOLS`\u3001`FUNCTIONS`\u3001`JSON`\u3001`MD_JSON`\u3001`JSON_SCHEMA`\u3001`CEREBRAS_JSON`\u3001`TOOLS`\u3001`TOOLS_STRICT`\u3001`FIREWORKS_JSON`\u3001`FIREWORKS_TOOLS", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:57:33.505829"}
