It creates an Image instance from a URL, checks that the source attribute matches the URL, confirms the media_type is correctly identified as \"image/webp\", and ensures that the data attribute is None, indicating no image data is loaded at this point. This ensures proper handling of image URLs with non-standard extensions.\n\n```python\ndef get_rca?????? \n``\n\nThe provided code snippet appears to be incomplete and contains syntax errors.
