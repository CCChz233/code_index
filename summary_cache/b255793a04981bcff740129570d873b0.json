{"summary": "- The code defines a POP3 client library with constants for ports, line endings, and a regular expression for timestamps.\n- It includes a private method `_getline` that reads a line from the socket.\n- The `_all` list includes the POP3 class and error handling.\nWe need to produce summary of functionality, focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs. Provide Chinese. Should start directly with summary content, no preamble. So just output Chinese description.\n\nWe need to analyze code snippet: It's part of poplib library. It defines constants, imports, __all__, POP3_PORT, POP3_SSL_PORT, CR, LF, CRLF, _MAXLINE, encoding, timestamp regex. Then defines method _getline(self) that reads a line from self.file (likely a socket file object). It reads up to _MAXLINE+1 bytes, checks length, raises error_proto if too long. Debug prints if debugging >1. If line empty raise error_proto '-ERR EOF'. Then calculates octets length. Handles line endings: if line ends with CRLF, returns line without CRLF and octets; if line starts with CR (i.e., CR...LF?), returns line[1:-1]; else returns line without final LF. Returns tuple (line_without_ending, octets). So business logic: reading POP3 server response lines, handling CR/LF variations, enforcing max line length, raising protocol errors.\n\nInputs: self.file (socket file), internal state debugging, constants. Output: tuple (bytes line content, int octets). Also may raise error_proto.\n\nNow produce summary in Chinese. Should mention that it's part of POP3 client library, defines constants, regex, and method for reading lines with proper handling.\n\nLet's craft final answer.assistantfinal\u5b9e\u73b0 POP3 \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u534f\u8bae\u5904\u7406\u3002  \n- **\u5e38\u91cf\u5b9a\u4e49**\uff1a  \n  - `POP3_PORT`\u3001`POP3_SSL_PORT`\uff1a\u9ed8\u8ba4\u660e\u6587/SSL \u7aef\u53e3\u3002  \n  - `CR`\u3001`LF`\u3001`CRLF`\uff1a\u884c\u7ed3\u675f\u7b26\u7684\u5b57\u8282\u8868\u793a\u3002  \n  - `_MAXLINE`\uff1a\u5355\u884c\u6700\u5927\u957f\u5ea6\uff082048 \u5b57\u8282\uff09\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u53d1\u9001\u8fc7\u957f\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f13\u51b2\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002  \n  - `encoding`\uff1a\u9ed8\u8ba4\u5b57\u7b26\u96c6 UTF\u20118\u3002  \n  - `timestamp`\uff1a\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684 `+OK` \u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\uff08\u5f62\u5982 `<", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:48:38.970386"}
