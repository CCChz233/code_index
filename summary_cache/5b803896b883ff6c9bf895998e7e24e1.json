{"summary": "The code defines a multipart handling module for aiohttp, providing classes and utilities to read and write multipart HTTP bodies. It includes `MultipartReader` for parsing multipart streams, `MultipartWriter` for constructing multipart messages, and `BodyPartReader` for accessing individual parts. The module handles content disposition parsing, filename extraction, and supports various payload types (JSON, strings, etc.). It also integrates compression utilities and defines constants for HTTP header names. The `at_eof` method checks if the multipart boundary has been reached, indicating the end of a part. Inputs are multipart HTTP streams or data, and outputs are parsed parts or constructed multipart bodies.", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:49:18.446562"}
