{"summary": "- The code defines a function `_dataset_builder` that creates a synthetic dataset with specified columns, data types, and size.\n- It takes inputs: `filename` (output file name), `columns` (list of column names), `dtypes` (list of data types), `size` (desired size of the dataset in bytes, default is 1 GiB), and `files_to_remove` (list of files to be removed after dataset creation).\n- The function validates that the number of columns matches the number of data types.\n- It calculates the memory usage of a single-row dataframe to estimate the number of rows needed to reach the desired dataset size.\n- It creates a dataframe with the calculated number of rows, saves it as a CSV file, and adds the file path to a global `filenames` list.\n- The function returns the generated dataframe.\n- The code also sets up logging, imports necessary modules, and defines constants for dataset size and directory paths.\n- No explicit output is printed or returned beyond the generated dataframe and CSV file.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code. They gave a code snippet. The assistant already gave a summary. But we need to follow the requirements: start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". Focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English). So we need to produce a summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). The previous answer is in English. We need to rewrite in Chinese, meeting the constraints.\n\nAlso note that the code snippet includes imports, logger, constants, and the function `_dataset_builder`. There's also a bug: they refer to `filenames` but not defined; but we just summarize functionality.\n\nWe need to start directly with the summary content, no preamble. So start with something like:\n\n- \u529f\u80fd\u6982\u8ff0: ...\n\nMake sure not to start with \"This code does...\" etc.\n\nLet's produce a concise Chinese summary focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs.\n\nAlso mention that it creates synthetic dataset, writes CSV, returns DataFrame.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal- \u529f\u80fd\u6982\u8ff0\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u6307\u5b9a\u5217\u540d\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5927\u5c0f\uff08\u9ed8\u8ba4 1\u202fGiB\uff09\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e3a CSV \u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd4\u56de\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684 Modin DataFrame\u3002  \n- \u8f93\u5165\u53c2\u6570  \n  - `filename`\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u7684 CSV \u6587\u4ef6\u540d\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9 `kaggle` \u5b50\u76ee\u5f55\uff09\u3002", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:34:59.364440"}
