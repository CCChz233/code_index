{"summary": "We need to summarize the functionality of the code. The code is a large versioneer implementation for Python packages. It includes functions to get version information from git, from parent directory, from keywords, etc. The code defines handlers for VCS (git). It registers functions for git get_keywords, git_versions_from_keywords, git_pieces_from_vcs, etc. It defines rendering functions for various version styles (pep440, git-describe, etc.). The main function get_versions() returns a dict with version, full-revisionid, dirty flag, error, date.\n\nThe code also includes LONG_VERSION_PY and SHORT_VERSION_PY templates for generating version files.\n\nThe code uses configparser to read versioneer config from setup.cfg.\n\nThe code includes a decorator register_vcs_handler to register VCS-specific functions.\n\nThe code includes run_command to execute external commands.\n\nThe code includes functions to parse git describe output, compute version pieces, and render them according to style.\n\nThe code includes functions to get version from parent directory name.\n\nThe code includes functions to extract keywords from version file.\n\nThe code includes functions to compute version from git keywords.\n\nThe code includes functions to compute version from git repository.\n\nThe code includes functions to render version strings in various PEP440 styles.\n\nThe code includes functions to parse PEP440 post-release segments.\n\nThe code includes functions to generate short version file.\n\nThe code includes sample config and error messages.\n\nThe code includes snippet for __init__.py.\n\nNow we need to produce a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English). The requirement: \"Start directly with the summary content. No 'This code does...' or 'Here is...'.\" So we need to start with the summary content directly.\n\nThus we need to produce a concise summary focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs.\n\nThe code is a version management utility for Python packages using git. It reads configuration, extracts version info from git tags, commit hashes, dirty state, parent directory, or expanded git-archive keywords, and renders version strings according to PEP440 or git-describe style. The main entry point get_versions() returns a dict with keys: version, full-revisionid, dirty, error, date.\n\nNow produce the answer accordingly. Use Chinese.\n\nLet's produce a summary:\n\n- \u8bfb\u53d6 versioneer \u914d\u7f6e (VCS, style, tag_prefix, parentdir_prefix, versionfile_source, verbose)\n- \u901a\u8fc7 git \u5173\u952e\u5b57\u3001git describe\u3001git rev-parse\u3001\u7236\u76ee\u5f55\u540d\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u83b7\u53d6\u7248\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\n-", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:33:11.417128"}
