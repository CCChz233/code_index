{"summary": "The code defines a module for handling wave audio files. It imports necessary modules and defines constants for wave format types. It also defines a named tuple `_wave_params` to store wave file parameters such as channels, sample width, etc. The `tell` function returns the current read position (size_read) in the wave file. It also checks whether the file is closed.\nThe user wants a summary of the functionality of the code, focusing on business logic, inputs, outputs, in Chinese (or Chinese/English). Must start directly with the summary content, no \"This code does...\" or \"Here is...\". So we need to produce a concise summary in Chinese, maybe with some English terms. Should mention that it's a wave file handling module, defines constants, namedtuple for parameters, a tell method that returns current read position, checks closed file. Also mention that __all__ includes open, Error, Wave_read, Wave_write. Provide business logic: reading/writing wave files, handling PCM format, etc. Provide inputs: wave file object, etc. Output: current position.\n\nLet's craft a paragraph in Chinese, maybe with bullet points? The requirement: \"Start directly with the summary content.\" So we should not have any preamble. Just start with the summary. Could be a paragraph or bullet list. Let's produce a concise summary.\n\nWe need to mention that the code defines constants for PCM and extensible formats, defines a GUID for PCM subtype, defines array format mapping, defines a namedtuple for wave parameters, defines a tell method that raises error if file closed and returns size_read. Also __all__ defines exported symbols.\n\nLet's produce final answer.assistantfinal- \u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9 **WAV \u97f3\u9891\u6587\u4ef6** \u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8bfb\u5199\u5c01\u88c5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b `open`, `Error`, `Wave_read`, `Wave_write` \u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u63a5\u53e3\uff08\u901a\u8fc7 `__all__` \u5bfc\u51fa\uff09\u3002  \n- \u5e38\u91cf `WAVE_FORMAT_PCM`\u3001`WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` \u4e0e `KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_PCM` \u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u8bc6 PCM \u7f16\u7801\u53ca\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f9b\u540e\u7eed\u89e3\u6790/\u5199\u5165\u65f6\u5339\u914d\u6587\u4ef6\u5934\u7684 `fmt` \u5757\u3002  \n- `_array_fmts` \u4fdd\u5b58\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684 Python `array` \u7c7b\u578b\u7801\uff08\u5982 `'b'`\u3001`'h'`\u3001`'i'`\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8bfb\u53d6\u539f\u59cb\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5feb\u901f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u6570\u7ec4\u3002  \n- `_", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:50:21.814110"}
