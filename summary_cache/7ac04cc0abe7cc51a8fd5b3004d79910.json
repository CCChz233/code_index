{"summary": "The code defines ****... ... ... etc...\n\nThe code defines a parameterized pytest test function `test_runmodel` that iterates over combinations of `model` and `mode` from predefined lists `models` and `modes`. It creates a Gemini client using `instructor.from_gemini` with a system instruction for extracting user information. The client sends a chat completion request with a user message \"Extract jason is 25 years old\" and expects a response conforming to the `UserExtract` Pydantic model. The test asserts that the response is an instance of `UserExtract`, verifies that the extracted `first_name` is \"jason\" (case-insensitive) and `age` is 25, and checks that the raw response attribute `_raw_response` is present. Inputs: model name, mode, user message. Outputs: validated `UserExtract` instance with extracted fields and raw response metadata.\n\nThe code defines a parameterized pytest test function `test_runmodel` that iterates **...**...\n\nThe code defines a parameterized pytest test function `test_runmodel` that iterates over all combinations of `model` and `mode` from the `models` and `modes` collections.
