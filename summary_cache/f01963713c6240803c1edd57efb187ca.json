{"summary": "- The code defines various utility functions and constants for the aiohttp library.\n- It includes imports and type definitions for various modules and classes.\n- The `proxies_from_env` function retrieves proxy settings from the environment variables and returns a dictionary mapping each protocol (http, https, ws, wss) to a `ProxyInfo` object containing the proxy URL and authentication information.\n- The function also handles the case where the proxy URL is not supported or the authentication is missing.\n- The code also includes a `BasicAuth` class and other helper functions for handling authentication.\nThe user asks: \"Summarize the functionality of the following code. Requirements: 1. Start directly with the summary content. No 'This code does...' or 'Here is...' 2. Focus on the business logic, inputs, and outputs. 3. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English).\"\n\nWe need to produce a summary in Chinese (or Chinese/English) that directly starts with the summary content, no preamble. Should focus on business logic, inputs, outputs. The code snippet is from aiohttp/helpers.py, includes many imports, constants, and a function proxies_from_env() that returns a dict of ProxyInfo objects based on environment variables and netrc. Also defines constants like COOKIE_MAX_LENGTH, etc. The __all__ includes BasicAuth, ChainMapProxy, ETag, reify. The code defines sentinel, etc. The summary should mention that the module provides helper utilities for aiohttp: constants for HTTP handling, token parsing, regexes, functions for proxy configuration, authentication handling, etc. The main function proxies_from_env reads environment proxies via urllib.getproxies, filters for http/https/ws/wss, strips auth, uses netrc for credentials, warns about unsupported schemes, returns mapping.\n\nWe need to start directly with the summary content. So start with something like:\n\n\"\u63d0\u4f9b aiohttp \u5e93\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5e38\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5305\u62ec...\"\n\nMake sure no \"This code does...\" etc. Use Chinese. Provide inputs and outputs. Mention that proxies_from_env takes no arguments, reads environment, returns dict.\n\nLet's craft a concise summary.assistantfinal\u63d0\u4f9b aiohttp \u5e93\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u5e38\u91cf\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\n\n- **\u73af\u5883\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u6790**\uff1a`proxies_from_env()` \u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u8c03\u7528 `urllib.request.getproxies()` \u8bfb\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:39:49.914161"}
