The code is from aiohttp/helpers.py. It imports many modules, defines constants, regexes, etc. The request: \"Summarize the functionality of the following code. Requirements: 1. Start directly with the summary content. No 'This code does...' or 'Here is...' 2. Focus on the business logic, inputs, and outputs. 3. Use Chinese (e.g., Chinese/English).\"\n\nWe need to produce a concise summary in Chinese (maybe with some English terms). Should describe the business logic: utility functions for aiohttp, handling authentication, cookies, headers, filename guessing, etc. Provide inputs and outputs.\n\nLet's craft a summary: The module defines helper utilities for aiohttp: BasicAuth class for HTTP Basic authentication (username/password, encoding to header), ChainMapProxy for read\u2011only view of multiple mappings, ETag parsing and matching utilities, reify decorator for cached properties, functions to guess filename from file\u2011like objects, functions to parse and format HTTP dates, functions to encode/decode cookies, functions to handle proxy settings, functions to compute content length, etc. Also defines constants for empty body status codes, methods, regexes for JSON content types, token validation, etc. Provide inputs/outputs: functions accept objects like file-like, strings, URLs, return strings, Path objects, parsed dates, etc.\n\nLet's produce a concise Chinese summary with bullet points.\n\nWe need to start directly with the summary content, no preamble.\n\nLet's write:\n\n- \u63d0\u4f9b aiohttp \u6846\u67b6\u5185\u90e8\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u7c7b\u548c\u51fd\u6570...\n- BasicAuth: \u8f93\u5165\u7528\u6237\u540d\u3001\u5bc6\u7801\u3001\u53ef\u9009\u5b57\u7b26\u96c6\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa HTTP", "prompt_id": "28ad819ea97a795ed2ae85e64d974c5c", "created_at": "2026-02-04T20:39:58.761695"}
