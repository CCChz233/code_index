Possibly the user wants to generate JSON for a function but no details given. The previous context was about tests/indexing_test.py. But now they ask for \"standalone_function_summaries:\" and then a JSON template. Perhaps they want to fill in with generic placeholders? Or maybe they want to output an empty JSON? The instruction: \"Given file-level metadata and function summaries, output a JSON object with keys: `summary`, `business_intent`, `keywords` (list).\" But there is no function summary provided. So we need to respond with a JSON with placeholders? Or indicate missing data? The best is to output a JSON with empty strings and empty list, indicating no data.\n\nBut maybe they want to produce a generic template. The prompt: \"standalone_function_summaries:\" then blank line then \"JSON:\" then a template. So they likely want us to fill in the JSON with appropriate content based on the function summaries, but there are none.
