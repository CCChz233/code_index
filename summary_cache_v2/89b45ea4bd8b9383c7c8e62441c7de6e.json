Based on class name LiteralToChainlitConverter and docstring (none). Method summaries indicate simple helper functions converting various objects (attachment, attachment dict, score to feedback dict, step, step dict, steptype, thread to thread dict). So class responsibility: converting literal data structures into Chainlit-compatible representations (Chainlit is a library for building LLM chat UI). So summary: provides utility methods to transform raw data (attachments, steps, scores, thread info) into the format expected by Chainlit. Business intent: facilitate integration of external data into Chainlit UI, enabling developers to easily map internal representations to Chainlit's schema for chat messages, feedback, etc. Keywords: conversion, helper, data mapping, Chainlit, attachment, step, feedback, thread, serialization, transformation.\n\nNow produce JSON.
