{"summary": "{\n \"summary\": ... \n{\"...\"} \n...\n}\nWe need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list. Based on file-level metadata: file_path roms_tools/download.py. Docstring empty. Imports: pooch. Globals none. Class summaries none. Standalone function summaries: four functions: download_correction_data, download_river_data, download_test_data, download_topo. All described as \"Simple helper download_...\". So the module provides helper functions to download various datasets (correction, river, test, topo) using pooch (a data download/cache library). Business intent: to facilitate obtaining required ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System) data files for modeling or analysis. Keywords: download, data, helper, pooch, correction data, river data, test data, topography, ROMS, dataset retrieval.\n\nNow produce JSON. Ensure no function names verbatim? The constraint: \"Do NOT list function names verbatim.\" So we shouldn't list the function names in summary or business_intent. But we can describe them generically. In keywords list, we can include generic terms but not the exact function names. So avoid \"download_correction_data\". Use \"correction dataset\", \"river dataset\", \"test dataset\", \"topography dataset\". That's okay.\n\nLet's craft summary: \"Provides utility functions that retrieve and cache various ROMS-related data files (e.g., correction coefficients, river forcing, test datasets, and topographic grids) using the pooch library.\"\n\nBusiness intent: \"Enable users to easily obtain the necessary input files for ROMS simulations without manual download, ensuring reproducibility and consistent data handling.\"\n\nKeywords list: [\"download\", \"data retrieval\", \"pooch\", \"ROMS\", \"correction coefficients\", \"river forcing\", \"test dataset\", \"topography\", \"caching\", \"utility functions\"].\n\nReturn JSON.assistantfinal{\n  \"summary\": \"Offers a set of utility functions that fetch and cache essential ROMS input files—such as correction coefficients, river forcing data, test datasets, and topographic grids—by leveraging the pooch library.\",\n  \"business_intent\": \"Simplify the acquisition of required ROMS data assets for modeling and analysis, ensuring reproducible and automated handling of input files.\",\n  \"keywords\": [\n    \"download\",\n    \"data retrieval\",\n    \"pooch\",\n    \"ROMS\",\n    \"correction coefficients\",\n    \"river forcing\",\n    \"test dataset\",\n    \"topography\",", "business_intent": "{\n \"summary\": ... \n{\"...\"} \n...\n}\nWe need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.
