Provide description of class responsibility and state/behavior. Avoid listing method names verbatim. So we need to summarize: HTTPSession is internal HTTP session object used to consume Chainlit through API (no websocket). It likely handles HTTP requests, maybe delete helper. Provide business intent: to enable API-based interaction with Chainlit without websockets. Keywords: HTTP, session, API, request handling, delete, internal, Chainlit, no websocket, client, network, communication.\n\nLet's craft JSON. Ensure proper JSON format. Provide summary: \"Manages an HTTP session for interacting with the Chainlit service via REST API, handling request lifecycle and providing convenience methods such as delete.\" Business intent: \"Allow applications to communicate with Chainlit using standard HTTP calls instead of a persistent websocket connection, simplifying integration and enabling stateless interactions.\" Keywords list.\n\nLet's output.assistantfinal```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Manages an HTTP session that communicates with the Chainlit service through standard REST calls, handling the lifecycle of requests and offering convenience operations such as resource deletion.\",\n  \"business_intent\": \"Provide a lightweight, stateless way for applications to interact with Chainlit via HTTP APIs, eliminating the need for a persistent websocket connection and simplifying integration.\",\n  \"keywords\": [\n    \"HTTP\",\n    \"session\",\n    \"REST\",\n    \"API\",\n    \"Chainlit\",\n    \"request handling\",\n    \"delete operation\",\n    \"stateless communication\",\n    \"no websocket\"\n  ]\n}\n```", "business_intent": "{\n{\"...\":\"... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... \n... ... ... ... \n... ... ... \n... ... \n...\" etc etc\n\n\n\nWe need to produce JSON with keys: summary, business_intent, keywords (list).
