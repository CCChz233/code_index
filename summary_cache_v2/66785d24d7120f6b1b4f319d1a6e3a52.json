So we need to infer class responsibility: maybe a step in a workflow, handling input/output, processing content, streaming tokens, sending, removing, updating, converting to dict. It also implements context manager methods (__enter__, __exit__, __aenter__, __aexit__) and callable. So likely a step that can be used as a context manager and callable, representing a unit of work in a pipeline. It handles content cleaning, processing, handling bytes, input/output, removal, sending, streaming tokens, conversion to dict, updating.\n\nThus summary: Represents a pipeline step that processes data, manages resources via context manager, can be invoked, and provides utilities for handling content, I/O, streaming, and state updates.\n\nBusiness intent: To encapsulate a discrete operation within a larger workflow, enabling modular, reusable processing of data with clean-up, streaming, and state management.\n\nKeywords: step, pipeline, context manager, processing, input, output, streaming, token, update, dictionary conversion, cleanup, send, remove, bytes handling.\n\nNow produce JSON.
