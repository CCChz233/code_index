{"summary": "The class encapsulates the acquisition, validation, and preparation of river discharge datasets for use as forcing inputs in ROMS simulations. It aligns river locations with the model grid, optionally converts incomplete records to climatological averages, supports inclusion of biogeochemical tracers, and exposes the processed data as an xarray Dataset. Utility functions enable reading from and writing to YAML configurations, visualizing river locations and time series, and persisting the final forcing file.", "business_intent": "Provide ocean modelers with a streamlined, reliable workflow to integrate river forcing data into ROMS, ensuring temporal completeness, spatial consistency with the model grid, and optional climatology handling, thereby reducing preprocessing effort and minimizing errors in model setup.", "keywords": ["river forcing", "ROMS", "ocean modeling", "xarray", "climatology conversion", "grid alignment", "data validation", "biogeochemical tracers", "visualization", "YAML I/O"], "summary_hash": "a2751fbb3458", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T03:53:29+00:00"}
