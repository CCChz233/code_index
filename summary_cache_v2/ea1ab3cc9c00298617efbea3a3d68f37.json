Provide description of class Task based on docstring and method summary. There's only __init__ method. So we need to infer class responsibilities: maybe a Task class representing a unit of work, with attributes like name, description, status, etc. But we have no details. The docstring is empty. Only method summary says __init__: Standard magic method implementation. So we have minimal info. We need to produce generic summary: \"Represents a task or unit of work within the system.\" Business intent: \"Encapsulate task data and behavior for tracking, scheduling, or execution.\" Keywords: [\"task\", \"unit of work\", \"status\", \"execution\", \"scheduling\", \"metadata\"].\n\nWe must not list method names verbatim, but we can mention initialization. Avoid using __init__ name. So we can say \"object construction\".
