{"summary": "{\n \"summary\": ... \n{\"...\"}\n\n\n\nWe need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords.\n\nWe have file_path tests/util_test.py. It's a test file for util functions. It imports arkouda.list_registry, arkouda.util.attach, arkouda.util.unregister_by_name, base_test.ArkoudaTest, context.arkouda, numpy. There's a class utilTest (likely subclass of ArkoudaTest). No standalone functions.\n\nWe need to infer what the test does: likely tests attach and unregister_by_name functions, maybe list registry. The summary should describe that this test module verifies utility functions for attaching and unregistering Arkouda objects, ensuring proper behavior of list registry and context handling. Business intent: ensure reliability of Arkouda utility functions for managing server-side objects, supporting data analysis workflows. Keywords: testing, Arkouda, utilities, attach, unregister, list registry, unit tests, Python, numpy.\n\nWe must not list function names verbatim, but can mention functionality. Avoid verbatim function names? The constraint: Do NOT list function names verbatim. So we shouldn't write \"attach\" or \"unregister_by_name\"? Probably avoid exact names. We can describe them generically: \"object attachment utility\" and \"object removal utility\". Also avoid \"list_registry\"? Might be okay as a term but maybe avoid exact function names. Use generic description.\n\nThus produce JSON. Ensure proper JSON format.

It uses the Arkouda testing framework and NumPy for assertions.\n\nBusiness intent: Ensure that the utility functions for managing Arkouda resources work correctly, preventing resource leaks and guaranteeing consistent state across distributed computations, which is critical for reliable data analytics pipelines.\n\nKeywords: [\"Arkoud a\", \"unit testing\", \"resource management\", \"distributed computing\", \"Python\", \"NumPy\", \"client-server\", \"object lifecycle\", \"test suite\"].\n\nMake sure no function names verbatim. Use \"object attachment\" instead of attach. Use \"named object removal\" instead of unregister_by_name. Use \"object list registry\".
