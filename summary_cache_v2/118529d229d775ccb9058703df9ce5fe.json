{"summary": "The module defines a class that represents a distributed array of strings stored on the Arkouda server. It uses offset and byte arrays to manage string data efficiently and provides a Pythonic sequence interface. The class offers extensive string manipulation capabilities, including searching, matching, replacing, splitting, case conversion, trimming, and regex operations with caching. It also supports conversion to/from native Python/NumPy structures and serialization to storage formats like HDF5 and Parquet.", "business_intent": "Enable large‑scale, server‑side string processing within the Arkouda framework, allowing users to perform complex text analytics on massive datasets without transferring data to the client.", "keywords": ["distributed strings", "server‑side processing", "offset array", "byte array", "regex caching", "search and replace", "split and join", "case conversion", "serialization", "HDF5", "Parquet", "Python sequence protocol"], "summary_hash": "cc3ad34914cc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T03:58:51+00:00"}
