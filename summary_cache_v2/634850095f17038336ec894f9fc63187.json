{"summary": "The file defines a set of test classes for verifying argmax/argmin and max/min operations on arrays, using a base test framework and NumPy for reference results. Each class runs a series of checks comparing Arkouda's output to NumPy's expected values across different array sizes and configurations.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness of Arkouda's extremum functions (argmax, argmin, max, min) by comparing them against NumPy's implementations, ensuring reliable behavior for various data scenarios.", "keywords": ["testing", "extrema", "argmax", "argmin", "max", "min", "validation", "NumPy", "Arkouda", "unit tests"], "summary_hash": "649645e24487", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T04:09:08+00:00"}
