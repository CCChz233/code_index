{"summary": "This module implements a Flax‑based training pipeline for DreamBooth fine‑tuning of Stable Diffusion. It defines dataset classes that load and preprocess instance‑specific and class‑wide images together with their textual prompts, prepares tokenized inputs, and supports multi‑GPU loading. Helper functions handle checkpointing, loss computation, optimizer steps, and parameter saving. A command‑line interface parses training options and the main routine orchestrates model loading, scheduler setup, training loops, and checkpoint management.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to customize a text‑to‑image diffusion model for a particular subject or style, producing personalized images by fine‑tuning Stable Diffusion with user‑provided data.", "keywords": ["DreamBooth", "Flax", "JAX", "Stable Diffusion", "fine‑tuning", "image generation", "custom subject", "dataset preprocessing", "tokenization", "multi‑GPU", "checkpointing", "training loop", "scheduler", "CLIP", "optimizer"], "summary_hash": "aa83f923c056", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:04:38+00:00"}
