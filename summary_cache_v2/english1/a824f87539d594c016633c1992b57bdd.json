{"summary": "The module provides a concise example of the SIGN (Scalable Inception Graph Neural Networks) approach, illustrating how to precompute multi‑hop diffusion of node features on a graph, construct a lightweight neural model that consumes the concatenated diffused features, and run a simple training and evaluation pipeline on the Cora citation network.", "business_intent": "Showcase an efficient graph neural network workflow that leverages sparse matrix operations for pre‑computed feature diffusion, enabling fast node classification on large graphs.", "keywords": ["graph neural networks", "SIGN", "diffusion operator", "sparse matrix", "DGL", "Cora dataset", "node classification", "precomputation", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "aa7e66f9b6ee", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:09:17+00:00"}
