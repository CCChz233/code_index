{"summary": "The module implements utilities for calculating flow budgets across the faces of a three‑dimensional grid. It defines helpers to identify face indices, collect fluxes on each boundary (front, lower, right, etc.), aggregate these contributions with Dask delayed execution, and compute face‑wise velocity and budget terms using xarray and NumPy arrays.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, parallel‑ready way to quantify inflow and outflow through the boundaries of a subsurface or fluid dynamics model, supporting model verification, water‑budget accounting, and performance analysis for large‑scale simulations.", "keywords": ["budget", "flow", "flux", "grid faces", "Dask", "xarray", "NumPy", "parallel computation", "hydrology", "groundwater modeling"], "summary_hash": "37d284360f2f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:43:02+00:00"}
