{"summary": "The data package supplies core abstractions and utilities for managing raster‑vision datasets, scenes, and their configurations. It includes activation mixins for lifecycle control, a dataset container for records, scene objects that bundle imagery and labels, configuration builders for datasets and scenes, and helper functions for converting between bounding boxes, GeoJSON, and shapely geometries.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to define, configure, load, and manipulate geospatial raster imagery and associated label data in a consistent, activation‑aware manner, supporting machine‑learning pipelines that require structured dataset and scene handling.", "keywords": ["raster vision", "dataset", "scene", "configuration", "activation", "context manager", "geospatial", "GeoJSON", "bounding box", "shapely", "data handling", "machine learning", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "420a4893fe5f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:04:17+00:00"}
