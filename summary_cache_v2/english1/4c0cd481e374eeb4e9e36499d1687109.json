{"summary": "The module implements the fundamental components of a Transformer architecture in PyTorch, including encoder and decoder blocks, a position‑wise feed‑forward network, a wrapper that adds layer normalization, dropout and residual connections around sub‑layers, and a generator that projects hidden states to vocabulary logits. It also provides a helper for duplicating modules.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to build and train Transformer‑based sequence‑to‑sequence models (e.g., machine translation, text generation) by supplying modular, reusable neural‑network layers that encapsulate attention, feed‑forward processing, and output projection.", "keywords": ["Transformer", "encoder", "decoder", "self‑attention", "cross‑attention", "feed‑forward", "layer normalization", "residual connection", "PyTorch", "neural network", "sequence modeling", "generator", "weight sharing"], "summary_hash": "e0b3259b1a68", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:31:04+00:00"}
