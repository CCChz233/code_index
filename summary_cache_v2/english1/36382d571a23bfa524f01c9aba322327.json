{"summary": "A configuration container for ViViT video transformer models that encapsulates all architectural hyperparameters such as image resolution, frame count, tubelet dimensions, channel count, hidden size, number of transformer layers, attention heads, feed‑forward size, activation, dropout rates, initialization scale, layer‑norm epsilon, and QKV bias flag. It inherits from PretrainedConfig, enabling seamless integration with the Transformers library and providing a reproducible way to instantiate a ViViT model with custom or default settings.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to easily define, modify, and share the structural settings of a ViViT model for video understanding tasks, facilitating model creation, fine‑tuning, and loading of pretrained weights with consistent configuration management.", "keywords": ["ViViT", "video transformer", "model configuration", "hyperparameters", "PretrainedConfig", "tubelet", "attention heads", "dropout", "initializer", "layer normalization"], "summary_hash": "980ed758b5bc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:22:15+00:00"}
