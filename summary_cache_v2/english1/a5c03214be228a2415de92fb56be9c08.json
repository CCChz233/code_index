{"summary": "This module programmatically constructs C++ source code for CUDA fused‑multi‑head‑attention kernels. It defines data structures that capture the characteristics of forward and backward kernels (such as data types, SM architecture, and tiling parameters) and supplies utilities to derive class names, implementation identifiers, and grouping information needed for code generation. The generated code is then written to appropriate files for compilation.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑performance transformer attention operations on NVIDIA GPUs by automatically producing optimized CUDA kernels, reducing manual coding effort and ensuring consistency across different hardware configurations.", "keywords": ["fused multi-head attention", "CUDA kernel generation", "forward kernel", "backward kernel", "code templating", "GPU acceleration", "xformers", "transformer performance", "C++ code emission", "SM architecture"], "summary_hash": "db677c7ea9f4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:30:29+00:00"}
