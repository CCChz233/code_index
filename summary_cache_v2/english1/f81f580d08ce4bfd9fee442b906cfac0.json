{"summary": "The module implements a multi‑GPU distributed training pipeline for a GraphSAGE‑style graph neural network on the Reddit dataset. It defines a neighbor sampler for mini‑batch subgraph extraction, a GraphSAGE model with a custom convolution layer, and utilities for accuracy computation, history tracking, and evaluation. The script orchestrates data loading, model parallelism, and training loops across multiple GPUs using PyTorch and DGL.", "business_intent": "Provide a reference implementation for scalable, high‑performance graph neural network training that can be leveraged in research or production environments requiring distributed processing of large‑scale graph data, such as social network analysis or recommendation systems.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "GraphSAGE", "neighbor sampling", "distributed training", "multi‑GPU", "DGL", "PyTorch", "Reddit dataset", "cross‑validation", "model evaluation"], "summary_hash": "e9c1a821bec4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:15:56+00:00"}
