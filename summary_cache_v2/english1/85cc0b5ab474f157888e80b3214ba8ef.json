{"summary": "Defines lightweight proxy objects that mimic Django model fields but are not actual database columns, primarily to expose the hidden ordering column used when a model specifies 'order_with_respect_to'. These proxies enable uniform handling of such internal attributes across the ORM, migrations, and serialization processes.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and Django internals to read and write the automatically created ordering field as if it were a normal model field, simplifying ordering logic, migration generation, and model deconstruction without requiring special‑case code.", "keywords": ["proxy", "field-like", "order_with_respect_to", "hidden ordering column", "model ordering", "deconstruction", "Django ORM", "transparent access"], "summary_hash": "d6d964190460", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:30:21+00:00"}
