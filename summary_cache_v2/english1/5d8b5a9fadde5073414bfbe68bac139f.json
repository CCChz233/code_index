{"summary": "LCMScheduler orchestrates the denoising diffusion process for generative models, extending DDPM with non‑Markovian guidance. It manages beta schedules, timestep spacing, scaling factors, clipping, and optional dynamic thresholding, and computes boundary‑condition scalings for consistency models. The class retains configuration state and offers utilities to step through the diffusion trajectory, adjust timesteps, and prepare model inputs for inference.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible, high‑quality sample generation in diffusion‑based AI pipelines by providing a configurable scheduler that supports custom noise schedules, inference step control, and advanced guidance techniques.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "denoising", "non‑Markovian guidance", "beta schedule", "timestep scaling", "dynamic thresholding", "sample clipping", "consistency model", "inference steps", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "d17f67cd6e69", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:56:58+00:00"}
