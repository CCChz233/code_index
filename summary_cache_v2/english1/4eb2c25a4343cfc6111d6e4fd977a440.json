{"summary": "Implements a configurable transformer block for a diffusion model, integrating multi-head self-attention, optional cross-attention to text embeddings, and a scaled feed-forward network with layer normalization and optional query/key normalization. All dimensions, head counts, and scaling factors are parameterized for flexible model design.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable, high-performance component that can be tuned for different hardware constraints and model sizes, enabling rapid development and deployment of image generation diffusion pipelines.", "keywords": ["transformer block", "multi-head attention", "cross attention", "feed-forward network", "layer normalization", "diffusion model", "configurable dimensions", "neural network module", "image generation", "scalable architecture"], "summary_hash": "24a7fe7ffddb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:30:20+00:00"}
