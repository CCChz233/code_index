{"summary": "Implements a CTC‑based word spotting component that leverages a context‑biasing graph to detect target words during speech decoding. It defines data structures for token passing and hypothesis tracking, and provides algorithms for beam pruning, hypothesis filtering, and selection of the best detections based on accumulated scores and frame positions.", "business_intent": "Enhance automatic speech recognition systems by enabling fast, accurate detection of user‑specified keywords or phrases, improving downstream tasks such as voice command activation, content indexing, and personalized language models.", "keywords": ["CTC", "word spotting", "context biasing", "token passing", "beam search", "hypothesis pruning", "speech decoding", "keyword detection", "acoustic frames", "confidence scoring"], "summary_hash": "9498e4337b9a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:14:31+00:00"}
