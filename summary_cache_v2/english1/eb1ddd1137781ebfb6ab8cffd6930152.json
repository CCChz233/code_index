{"summary": "Implements a probability‑based non‑maximum suppression algorithm that iteratively extracts the highest‑probability coordinate from a multi‑dimensional probability map, optionally applies Gaussian smoothing, and removes a surrounding region defined by a configurable box size until no remaining peaks exceed a given threshold.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable component for computer‑vision, medical‑imaging, and scientific‑analysis workflows that need robust peak or object detection from probability fields, enabling downstream tasks such as object localization, cell counting, or key‑point extraction.", "keywords": ["non‑maximum suppression", "probability map", "peak detection", "multi‑dimensional", "Gaussian filter", "thresholding", "box size", "coordinate selection", "image analysis", "object localization"], "summary_hash": "41648fdb9023", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:02:07+00:00"}
