{"summary": "The module implements a full training pipeline for a text‑to‑image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion). It parses command‑line arguments, loads and preprocesses a captioned image dataset, tokenizes captions, constructs the VAE, UNet and text encoder components, configures optimizers, schedulers and EMA, runs a distributed training loop with optional validation image generation, saves checkpoints, and optionally creates and uploads a model card to the Hugging Face Hub.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑use reference script that enables developers and researchers to fine‑tune or train their own Stable Diffusion models on custom data, accelerating the creation of proprietary generative image solutions.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "text-to-image", "diffusion model training", "accelerate", "distributed training", "fine‑tuning", "image generation", "model checkpointing", "model card", "huggingface hub"], "summary_hash": "ed372dc474a4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:05:42+00:00"}
