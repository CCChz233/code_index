{"summary": "The module provides tools to analyze a medical imaging dataset, automatically estimating an optimal voxel spacing for 3‑D resampling and calculating intensity statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) required for data normalization. It encapsulates this functionality in a class that processes datasets, aggregates spacing information across samples, and produces a concise summary usable in preprocessing pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to streamline the preprocessing of biomedical imaging data for deep‑learning segmentation models by automatically determining resampling parameters and normalization statistics, thereby reducing manual effort, ensuring consistency, and improving model training efficiency.", "keywords": ["medical imaging", "dataset analysis", "voxel spacing", "resampling", "intensity statistics", "normalization", "segmentation", "MONAI", "preprocessing", "3D images"], "summary_hash": "2c18f1eb00ae", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:12:28+00:00"}
