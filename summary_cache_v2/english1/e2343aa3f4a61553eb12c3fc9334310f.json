{"summary": "The module defines a suite of unit tests that verify the correct operation of NVTX profiling transforms, including marking and range push/pop utilities, across different input types such as scalar values, NumPy arrays, and dictionaries. The tests employ parameterized cases and integrate with PyTorch tensors to ensure the transforms behave as expected in various scenarios.", "business_intent": "Validate the reliability of NVTX profiling utilities within the MONAI framework to support performance instrumentation and debugging of medical imaging pipelines.", "keywords": ["unit test", "NVTX", "profiling", "transforms", "MONAI", "Mark", "RangePush", "RangePop", "randomized", "array", "dictionary", "tensor", "PyTorch", "parameterized"], "summary_hash": "59ea37736f53", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:56:02+00:00"}
