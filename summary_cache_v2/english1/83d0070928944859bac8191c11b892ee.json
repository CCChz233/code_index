{"summary": "This module contains a collection of unit tests that verify Dask's array FFT functionality. The tests compare Dask's FFT, inverse FFT, frequency generation, and shift operations against NumPy equivalents, assess behavior with various chunk configurations and axes, and check error handling for unsupported options.", "business_intent": "Ensure that Dask's fast Fourier transform capabilities are mathematically correct, compatible with NumPy, and robust across different array chunking strategies, thereby providing reliable parallel FFT computations for scientific and analytical workloads.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "fft", "testing", "numpy compatibility", "chunked arrays", "frequency domain", "fftshift", "fftfreq", "error handling", "parallel computation"], "summary_hash": "c09611306f19", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:21:43+00:00"}
