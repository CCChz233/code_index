{"summary": "The module introduces two handler classes that encapsulate MONAI's MetricsReloaded binary and categorical pairwise metric objects, integrating them with Ignite's metric handling framework. These handlers compute, reduce, and expose metric values during training or validation, providing a clean interface for accessing and manipulating the metric data.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless incorporation of advanced pairwise evaluation metrics for binary and multi‑class segmentation tasks into MONAI training pipelines, allowing automatic computation, reduction, and logging of these metrics within Ignite engines.", "keywords": ["MONAI", "MetricsReloaded", "binary metrics", "categorical metrics", "pairwise metrics", "IgniteMetricHandler", "metric reduction", "segmentation evaluation", "deep learning", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "fb0435e2c8d3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:09:17+00:00"}
