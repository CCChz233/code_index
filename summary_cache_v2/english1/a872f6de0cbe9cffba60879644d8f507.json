{"summary": "Defines data model classes that encapsulate calibration and performance metrics of a quantum backend, including per‑qubit and per‑gate properties, and a lightweight container for named measurements. The classes support attribute access, equality checks, dictionary conversion, and JSON‑compatible serialization.", "business_intent": "Enable Qiskit users and developers to retrieve, manipulate, and persist hardware calibration information such as error rates, gate lengths, and coherence times, facilitating hardware‑aware circuit compilation and analysis.", "keywords": ["backend properties", "calibration data", "qubit metrics", "gate metrics", "error rates", "coherence times", "serialization", "deserialization", "quantum hardware", "Qiskit", "data model", "measurement unit", "gate properties"], "summary_hash": "0725a6f11421", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:33:10+00:00"}
