{"summary": "The class calculates the mean Intersection over Union (IoU) between predicted segmentation tensors and one‑hot ground‑truth tensors, handling both multi‑class and multi‑label scenarios. It can optionally exclude the background channel, supports various reduction strategies (none, mean, sum, per‑batch, per‑channel), and can ignore empty ground‑truth cases by assigning NaN or a perfect score.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable metric for assessing the accuracy of image segmentation models during training and evaluation, enabling developers to monitor and compare model performance across different classes and configurations.", "keywords": ["IoU", "Intersection over Union", "segmentation metric", "multi-class", "multi-label", "background exclusion", "reduction", "tensor", "batch processing", "empty ground truth handling"], "summary_hash": "0526041ec671", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:24:39+00:00"}
