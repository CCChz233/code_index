{"summary": "The module offers dictionary-oriented wrappers for core I/O operations, enabling loading of image files with metadata extraction and optional stacking, saving of channel‑first medical images with metadata handling and flexible naming, and recording of original‑to‑new file mappings in JSON. These wrappers integrate seamlessly with MONAI's transform pipeline by operating on key‑value data structures.", "business_intent": "Streamline the incorporation of image I/O tasks into medical imaging deep‑learning workflows, reducing boilerplate code and ensuring consistent handling of metadata, affine information, and file organization when processing data dictionaries.", "keywords": ["dictionary transform", "image loading", "image saving", "file mapping", "medical imaging", "metadata handling", "affine consistency", "channel‑first", "resampling", "datatype conversion", "JSON mapping", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "a445499e1dcb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:24:13+00:00"}
