{"summary": "This example package implements the Metapath2Vec algorithm with PyTorch. It includes utilities to download and prepare heterogeneous graph datasets, generate metapath‑guided random walks, train a skip‑gram neural network to produce low‑dimensional node embeddings, and export the learned vectors for downstream tasks such as node classification.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run reference implementation that enables researchers and engineers to quickly obtain high‑quality embeddings for heterogeneous networks, facilitating experiments and applications in graph‑based machine learning.", "keywords": ["metapath2vec", "heterogeneous network embedding", "PyTorch", "random walk sampling", "skip‑gram model", "node classification", "dataset preparation", "graph representation learning"], "summary_hash": "fefa8c503ce3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:52:10+00:00"}
