{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that takes an input image and a textual instruction, encodes the image into latent space, applies a Stable Diffusion UNet conditioned on the instruction to perform pixel‑level edits, and decodes the edited latents back into an image. The pipeline integrates safety checking and supports extensions such as LoRA, textual inversion, and IP‑adapter for enhanced conditioning.", "business_intent": "Enable users and developers to perform high‑quality, text‑guided image manipulation and creative editing through a ready‑to‑use diffusion pipeline, while ensuring safety and extensibility for various AI‑enhanced content creation workflows.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "image editing", "text‑guided diffusion", "pix2pix", "latent encoding", "UNet conditioning", "safety checker", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "IP‑adapter", "diffusion pipeline"], "summary_hash": "1f455d8daeb4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:25:02+00:00"}
