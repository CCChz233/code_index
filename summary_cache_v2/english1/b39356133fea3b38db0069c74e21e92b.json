{"summary": "This module implements a serializer that maps Python optional values to and from the Cairo on-chain representation used by Starknet contracts. It encodes None and wrapped values as a list structure, delegating the inner type's serialization to the appropriate Cairo data serializer, and utilizes serialization and deserialization contexts for proper handling.", "business_intent": "Facilitate reliable data exchange between Python applications (such as CCXT integrations) and Starknet smart contracts by providing a standardized way to serialize and deserialize optional fields, ensuring compatibility with the blockchain's expected data format.", "keywords": ["optional", "serializer", "Cairo", "Starknet", "serialization", "deserialization", "Python", "CCXT", "on-chain representation", "data conversion", "context-aware"], "summary_hash": "f26134561f67", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:46:17+00:00"}
