{"summary": "This module implements the bridge between Litellm's generic interface and Anthropic's `/v1/complete` endpoint. It defines configuration handling, error encapsulation, and a client wrapper that builds requests, parses responses, supports synchronous, asynchronous, and streaming calls, and extracts usage statistics.", "business_intent": "To simplify the integration of Anthropic's language model into applications by providing a high‑level, reusable client that abstracts HTTP communication, error handling, and response processing, enabling developers to generate text completions, retrieve embeddings, and monitor usage without dealing with low‑level API details.", "keywords": ["anthropic", "completion", "api client", "text generation", "streaming", "asynchronous", "error handling", "configuration", "embeddings", "httpx", "requests", "model response", "usage metrics"], "summary_hash": "03ab68cedbf4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:55:13+00:00"}
