{"summary": "The file defines a loss module for binary cross-entropy (BCE) tailored for ASR tasks. It computes BCE between model predictions (after sigmoid) and binary targets, handling optional masking and integrating with NeMo's neural‑type system, returning a scalar loss for back‑propagation.", "business_intent": "To enable training of speech models that output binary decisions (e.g., voice activity detection, keyword spotting) by providing a ready‑to‑use BCE loss compatible with the NeMo framework.", "keywords": ["binary cross-entropy", "BCE loss", "ASR", "NeMo", "neural types", "sigmoid", "binary labels", "training", "gradient descent"], "summary_hash": "799919cea4b2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:06:20+00:00"}
