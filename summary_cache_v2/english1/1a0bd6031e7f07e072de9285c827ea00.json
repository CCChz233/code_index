{"summary": "Implements a positive random feature mapping based on the hyperbolic kernel (SMHyp+), as described in the Performers paper. The class projects input data into a feature space that approximates the kernel, enabling efficient, scalable computation of attention‑like operations.", "business_intent": "Provide a fast, memory‑efficient approximation of the hyperbolic kernel for large‑scale models, allowing practitioners to replace exact attention with a low‑cost feature‑based alternative.", "keywords": ["random features", "hyperbolic kernel", "SMHyp+", "Performers", "attention approximation", "scalable transformer", "kernel approximation", "machine learning", "efficient computation"], "summary_hash": "d470c0cbd3e7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:21:56+00:00"}
