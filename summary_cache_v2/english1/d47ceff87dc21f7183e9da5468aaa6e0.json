{"summary": "Implements an evaluator that measures how accurately a multilingual sentence embedding model can align source sentences with their correct target translations. It encodes source and target texts, computes pairwise cosine similarities, and reports the proportion of correct matches in both source‑to‑target and target‑to‑source directions.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to quantitatively assess the translation matching capability of multilingual embedding models, supporting model comparison, validation, and improvement for cross‑lingual applications.", "keywords": ["translation evaluation", "multilingual embeddings", "sentence similarity", "cosine similarity", "accuracy", "cross‑lingual alignment", "benchmarking", "sentence_transformers"], "summary_hash": "dcee9a04a826", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:56:10+00:00"}
