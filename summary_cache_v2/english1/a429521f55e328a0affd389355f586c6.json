{"summary": "A set of illustrative examples that teach how to use Python and Cython memoryviews with NumPy arrays and the built‑in array module for fast, low‑level data manipulation. The snippets cover element‑wise arithmetic, copying, slicing, transposing, inspecting memory layout, handling nullable buffers, and passing memoryviews to C code.", "business_intent": "To demonstrate practical techniques for high‑performance numeric programming by leveraging the buffer protocol and memoryviews, helping developers write faster, memory‑efficient code and understand Python‑C/Cython interoperability.", "keywords": ["memoryview", "NumPy", "Cython", "buffer protocol", "array manipulation", "efficient computation", "slicing", "transpose", "memory layout", "C interoperability"], "summary_hash": "b8d2e94f1877", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:31:08+00:00"}
