{"summary": "The module defines a differential image‑to‑image generation pipeline for the Flux family of diffusion models. It encodes an input image into latent space with a VAE, extracts textual conditioning using CLIP and T5 encoders, prepares latent representations, runs a conditional transformer denoiser guided by a scheduler, and finally decodes the refined latents back into images. The file also contains small utility helpers for latent and timestep handling.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use example that lets developers and researchers create new images guided by both an existing picture and textual prompts, accelerating creative content generation, prototyping, and experimentation with Flux diffusion technology.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "image-to-image", "Flux", "pipeline", "VAE", "CLIP", "T5", "transformer", "scheduler", "latent space", "conditioning", "generation", "example"], "summary_hash": "c3fad814d57a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:01:18+00:00"}
