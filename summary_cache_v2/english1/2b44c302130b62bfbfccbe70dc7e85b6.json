{"summary": "The module implements a training and evaluation pipeline for a Probabilistic Graph Neural Network using DGL and PyTorch. It loads a dataset, prepares graph structures, constructs the PGNN model, runs iterative optimization, computes loss values, and assesses model performance with metrics such as ROC AUC.", "business_intent": "Enable users to train and benchmark a graph neural network model on custom graph data, facilitating research or production workflows that require node or link classification with probabilistic reasoning.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "training loop", "loss computation", "ROC AUC", "dataset preprocessing", "anchor selection"], "summary_hash": "bfc668b35bee", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:16:24+00:00"}
