{"summary": "Test suites that verify the UnCLIP image generation and image‑variation pipelines, exercising lightweight dummy components as well as full model runs (including the Karlo model). They check functionality across CPU, attention slicing, mixed‑precision, batch processing, and model serialization to guarantee correct behavior in diverse environments.", "business_intent": "Provide confidence that the UnCLIP pipelines reliably generate images and variations, supporting AI‑driven content creation and ensuring stable deployment in production systems.", "keywords": ["UnCLIP", "image generation", "image variation", "pipeline testing", "unit tests", "integration tests", "attention slicing", "mixed precision", "batch processing", "model serialization", "dummy components", "CPU execution", "Karlo model"], "summary_hash": "1c794b53a3ae", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:33:47+00:00"}
