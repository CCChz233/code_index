{"summary": "Provides two latent‑diffusion pipelines: one that transforms textual prompts into high‑quality images using a transformer‑based text encoder, UNet denoiser, diffusion schedulers and a VAE decoder; and another that upscales low‑resolution images by encoding them into a latent space with a vector‑quantized model, iteratively denoising with a UNet, and decoding back to a higher‑resolution image.", "business_intent": "Empower developers and enterprises to integrate state‑of‑the‑art generative AI for creating visual content from text and enhancing image resolution, supporting creative media production, marketing assets, and product visualization.", "keywords": ["latent diffusion", "text‑to‑image", "super‑resolution", "transformer encoder", "UNet denoiser", "diffusion scheduler", "VAE decoder", "vector‑quantized model", "AI image generation", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "206f309a3c49", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:41:13+00:00"}
