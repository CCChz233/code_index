{"summary": "The module implements a diffusion scheduler tailored for the UFOGen model, handling the configuration of beta schedules, timestep management, noise injection, input scaling, clipping, and optional dynamic thresholding. It provides the core sampling workflow for both single-step and multi-step image generation, along with a lightweight data container for scheduler step outputs.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and efficient generation of images using the UFOGen diffusion model, supporting research, prototyping, and deployment of generative AI applications that require customizable diffusion schedules and sampling strategies.", "keywords": ["diffusion scheduler", "UFOGen", "beta schedule", "timestep handling", "noise addition", "dynamic thresholding", "image generation", "generative AI", "PyTorch", "diffusers library"], "summary_hash": "78a0d1d53e26", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:01:15+00:00"}
