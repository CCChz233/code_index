{"summary": "Provides a PyTorch module that implements an edge‑conditioned graph convolution layer. The layer generates weight matrices from edge attributes, multiplies them with neighboring node features, aggregates the resulting messages (sum, mean, or max), and updates node embeddings with optional residual connections and bias.", "business_intent": "Enables developers to build graph neural networks that leverage edge information for tasks such as molecular property prediction, recommendation systems, or any domain where relationships carry rich features, by offering a ready‑to‑use, configurable convolution operation within the DGL framework.", "keywords": ["graph convolution", "edge‑conditioned", "PyTorch", "DGL", "message passing", "aggregation", "residual connection", "bias term", "node embedding", "edge features"], "summary_hash": "c7cfb7f20d0f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:45:56+00:00"}
