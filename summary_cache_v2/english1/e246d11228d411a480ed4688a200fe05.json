{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that leverages Stable Diffusion together with ControlNet to perform image inpainting. The pipeline encodes textual prompts, prepares masks and conditioning images, runs the denoising process, and applies a safety checker before returning the generated image.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and creators with an out‑of‑the‑box example for high‑quality, controllable image editing, enabling automated inpainting workflows in AI‑driven content creation platforms.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "controlnet", "inpainting", "image generation", "mask handling", "prompt encoding", "latent diffusion", "safety checking", "AI art", "generative model"], "summary_hash": "fca7a7c5c625", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:59:39+00:00"}
