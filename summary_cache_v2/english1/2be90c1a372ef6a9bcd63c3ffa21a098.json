{"summary": "Implements the multi‑head attention mechanism from the Transformer architecture, tailored for visual data in the Idefics model. It projects queries, keys, and values, splits them across multiple attention heads, computes scaled dot‑product attention, and merges the results to produce contextualized visual embeddings.", "business_intent": "Supply a core attention component that enhances vision‑language models by enabling effective feature interaction across image regions, thereby improving performance on multimodal tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and image‑text retrieval.", "keywords": ["multi-head attention", "Transformer", "vision", "Idefics", "scaled dot-product", "visual embeddings", "deep learning", "computer vision", "multimodal", "attention mechanism"], "summary_hash": "1d4c53adcf4e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:42:05+00:00"}
