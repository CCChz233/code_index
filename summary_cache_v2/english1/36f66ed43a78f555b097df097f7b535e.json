{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class Postprocessing: manager for postprocessing steps on model predictions. It takes parameters dict indicating steps order, prediction array, voxel dimensions, filename prefix. It stores resolution per axis, number of classes, binary struct. Methods: apply (apply steps), binarize_maxpooling, binarize_prediction, fill_holes, keep_largest, remove_noise, remove_small, uncertainty. So responsibilities: orchestrate sequence of postprocessing operations on segmentation predictions, such as binarization, hole filling, noise removal, size filtering, uncertainty estimation. Business intent: to refine raw model outputs into clean, usable segmentation masks for downstream medical imaging analysis, ensuring proper resolution handling and saving results.
