{"summary": "This test suite validates the labour component of a health simulation framework. It sets up a simulation environment, registers relevant modules, and defines helper utilities to retrieve event data and configure pregnancy attributes. The tests aim to confirm that risk calculations, event scheduling, and treatment delivery for labour-related scenarios—such as intrapartum complications, caesarean sections, home births, and stillbirths—behave as expected under various constraint configurations.", "business_intent": "Ensure the accuracy and reliability of labour-related processes in the simulation, guaranteeing that clinical events and interventions are correctly modeled for policy analysis and health outcomes research.", "keywords": ["labour", "simulation testing", "obstetric events", "complication risk", "event scheduling", "treatment delivery", "pregnancy", "caesarean section", "home birth", "stillbirth", "health system integration"], "summary_hash": "f661555bc3ec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:42:42+00:00"}
