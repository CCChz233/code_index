{"summary": "The dask.array package implements a parallel, chunked multi‑dimensional array library that mirrors NumPy’s API while deferring all operations to Dask’s task‑graph scheduler. It provides core array types, lazy construction utilities, blockwise graph building, backend abstraction (NumPy, CuPy, etc.), and a wide range of scientific functions—including linear algebra, FFTs, random sampling, reductions, and statistical tests—so that large out‑of‑core or distributed datasets can be processed efficiently.", "business_intent": "Enable data‑intensive scientific, analytical, and machine‑learning workloads to scale beyond a single machine by offering a familiar NumPy‑like interface that automatically handles parallelism, chunking, and out‑of‑core execution on clusters or GPUs.", "keywords": ["parallel array", "lazy evaluation", "chunked computation", "distributed computing", "NumPy compatibility", "high‑level graph", "out‑of‑core", "GPU backend", "linear algebra", "FFT", "random generation", "reductions", "blockwise operations", "Dask"], "summary_hash": "e0a82492b9a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:26:53+00:00"}
