{"summary": "Applies a stochastic augmentation that selects a random subset of image channels and replaces their pixel values with a constant fill, optionally controlled by a probability. The number of channels to drop is chosen from a configurable range, and the transform validates that the operation is feasible for the given image dimensionality.", "business_intent": "Enhances training data diversity and model resilience to missing, corrupted, or unavailable channel information in multi‑channel imagery such as RGB, multispectral, or hyperspectral data, thereby improving robustness and generalization of computer‑vision models.", "keywords": ["channel dropout", "data augmentation", "random channel removal", "fill value", "probability", "multi‑spectral", "hyperspectral", "robustness", "image preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "151236d43107", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:24:40+00:00"}
