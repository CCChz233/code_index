{"summary": "The module implements a training pipeline for textual inversion, allowing users to learn new token embeddings from image‑text data using diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion). It defines a dataset abstraction for handling image‑text pairs, integrates Accelerate for distributed training, leverages ONNX Runtime optimizations, and provides utilities for checkpointing, model‑card generation, and progress saving.", "business_intent": "To provide a ready‑to‑use solution for researchers and developers to extend text‑to‑image models with custom concepts, accelerating training with ONNX Runtime and simplifying model management and deployment.", "keywords": ["textual inversion", "stable diffusion", "diffusion models", "ONNX Runtime", "accelerate", "embedding training", "dataset", "checkpoint", "model card", "Hugging Face"], "summary_hash": "34c462404f25", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:07:59+00:00"}
