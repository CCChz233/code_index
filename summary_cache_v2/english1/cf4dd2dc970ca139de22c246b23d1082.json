{"summary": "A configuration container that holds all architectural and training hyperparameters for a GPTNeoX transformer model, such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of layers and heads, activation functions, dropout rates, rotary embedding settings, layer‑norm epsilon, caching options, and optional scaling of RoPE embeddings. It inherits from a generic pretrained‑config base and is used to instantiate a GPTNeoX model with the desired structure.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, programmatic way for developers and researchers to specify, share, and reproduce the exact GPTNeoX model architecture and training behavior, enabling easy model creation, fine‑tuning, and deployment across different environments.", "keywords": ["GPTNeoX", "configuration", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "dropout", "rotary embeddings", "layer normalization", "cache", "parallel residual", "rope scaling", "attention bias", "pretrained config"], "summary_hash": "0858a1d58149", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:28:26+00:00"}
