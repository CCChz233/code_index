{"summary": "This module implements a suite of utilities for streaming automatic speech recognition in NeMo. It provides classes that manage audio buffers, feature frame buffers, and rolling buffers, as well as pipelines that process audio in fixed-size frames or chunks for batch inference with CTC, RNNT, and multi‑task AED models. The utilities also include functions for collating data, normalizing features, and handling alignment merging.", "business_intent": "Enable real‑time or low‑latency speech transcription and audio event detection by offering flexible streaming data handling and model‑agnostic inference pipelines that can be integrated into production ASR services.", "keywords": ["streaming", "audio buffer", "feature extraction", "batch inference", "CTC", "RNNT", "AED", "alignment merging", "real-time transcription", "NeMo", "ASR"], "summary_hash": "baccbe29f863", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:13:10+00:00"}
