{"summary": "Implements a WordPiece‑based tokenizer for the ELECTRA model, managing vocabulary loading, optional lower‑casing, basic tokenization, and special token handling. It converts between tokens and IDs, assembles input sequences with required special tokens, and generates token‑type IDs for model consumption.", "business_intent": "Provide preprocessing utilities that transform raw text into token IDs and related structures needed by ELECTRA, enabling downstream NLP applications such as classification, question answering, and masked language modeling.", "keywords": ["ELECTRA", "tokenizer", "WordPiece", "vocabulary", "lowercasing", "special tokens", "token IDs", "preprocessing", "NLP", "sequence building"], "summary_hash": "a38f66b4c5ef", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:20:07+00:00"}
