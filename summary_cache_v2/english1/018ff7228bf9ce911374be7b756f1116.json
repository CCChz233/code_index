{"summary": "This module provides dictionary-oriented transforms that create a smooth random field on each invocation and apply it to selected entries in a data dictionary for spatial deformation, contrast adjustment, or intensity scaling. The transforms support configurable spatial size, padding, interpolation modes per key, probability of application, parameter ranges, and device placement.", "business_intent": "Offer flexible, stochastic data augmentation tools for medical imaging workflows, enhancing model robustness by introducing smooth geometric and intensity variations into training data.", "keywords": ["smooth random field", "dictionary transform", "data augmentation", "medical imaging", "spatial deformation", "contrast adjustment", "intensity scaling", "probabilistic augmentation", "interpolation", "device placement"], "summary_hash": "834d550610df", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:22:35+00:00"}
