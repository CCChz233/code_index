{"summary": "The module implements a versatile 2‑dimensional transformer architecture designed for diffusion models, processing image‑like tensors (continuous latents, patched or vectorized discrete data). It integrates multi‑head self‑attention, optional cross‑attention conditioning, positional embeddings, patch embedding, adaptive layer normalization, and configurable depth, dropout, and projection layers to produce transformed latent representations.", "business_intent": "Supply a reusable, configurable transformer component that powers image generation and editing pipelines in diffusion‑based AI systems, enabling efficient handling of spatial data, conditioning on text or other modalities, and fine‑grained control over model capacity and performance.", "keywords": ["transformer", "2d", "diffusion", "attention", "cross‑attention", "positional embeddings", "patch embedding", "adaptive layer norm", "latent representation", "image generation", "torch", "neural network"], "summary_hash": "64d0a42342c6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:30:39+00:00"}
