{"summary": "The class generates a customizable blur kernel using a generalized Gaussian distribution, allowing independent horizontal and vertical spreads, optional rotation, and multiplicative noise. The kernel is normalized and applied to an image via convolution, producing a randomized blur effect for augmentation.", "business_intent": "Enable advanced image augmentation that simulates a wide range of realistic blur and degradation patterns, improving the robustness of computer‑vision models during training.", "keywords": ["generalized Gaussian blur", "anisotropic blur", "kernel rotation", "kernel noise", "data augmentation", "image convolution", "synthetic degradation", "computer vision", "training robustness"], "summary_hash": "21de24829b10", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:22:26+00:00"}
