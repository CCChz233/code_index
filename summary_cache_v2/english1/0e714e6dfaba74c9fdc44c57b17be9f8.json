{"summary": "Represents a global Y‑axis rotation gate that applies the same RY(θ) operation to every qubit in the register simultaneously. For a single qubit it behaves like the standard RY gate, while for multiple qubits it is the direct sum of individual RY rotations, matching native hardware capabilities of ion‑trap and neutral‑atom systems.", "business_intent": "Enable concise expression and efficient execution of uniform Y‑rotations across all qubits on platforms that support native global gates, reducing circuit depth and simplifying mapping to hardware.", "keywords": ["global RY", "multi‑qubit rotation", "Y‑axis gate", "ion trap", "neutral atoms", "native gate", "quantum circuit", "direct sum", "uniform rotation"], "summary_hash": "326338dc6bd0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:35:30+00:00"}
