{"summary": "Provides a command‑line utility that evaluates CTC and hybrid RNNT‑CTC speech‑recognition models using greedy decoding with optional contextual biasing. It loads a NeMo model, processes an evaluation manifest, applies a CTC‑based word‑spotting biasing graph derived from a user‑supplied context file, optionally runs a grid search over beam thresholds, context scores and alignment token weights, and writes prediction outputs and performance metrics.", "business_intent": "Allows ASR developers and researchers to measure and tune the effect of contextual biasing on model accuracy, especially for domain‑specific terms and abbreviations, facilitating model selection and hyper‑parameter optimization for production or research deployments.", "keywords": ["ASR", "CTC", "RNNT", "contextual biasing", "greedy decoding", "hyperparameter grid search", "word spotting", "model evaluation", "NVIDIA NeMo", "speech recognition"], "summary_hash": "ea537d02b6de", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:43:53+00:00"}
