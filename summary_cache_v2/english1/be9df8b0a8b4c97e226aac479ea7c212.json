{"summary": "Implements a Keras layer that performs max pooling over three spatial dimensions of a 5‑D tensor, reducing depth, height and width by taking the maximum value within sliding windows defined by pool size and stride, with optional padding and configurable channel ordering.", "business_intent": "Provide neural network models with an efficient way to downsample 3‑D feature maps (such as volumetric or spatio‑temporal data), lowering computational cost and memory usage while preserving the most salient activations.", "keywords": ["max pooling", "3D", "downsampling", "spatial dimensions", "stride", "padding", "channels_last", "channels_first", "Keras layer", "neural network", "feature extraction"], "summary_hash": "a89709eeebef", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:02:53+00:00"}
