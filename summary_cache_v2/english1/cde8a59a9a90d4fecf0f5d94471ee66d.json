{"summary": "The script orchestrates the end‑to‑end training workflow for a spoken language understanding model that predicts intents and slots from speech. It guides users to generate a tokenizer, configure dataset manifests, set model and optimizer parameters, launch distributed GPU training, and optionally log experiments with Weights & Biases.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run pipeline for developers and researchers to build, fine‑tune, or evaluate speech intent‑slot models for voice‑assistant or other SLU applications.", "keywords": ["speech intent", "slot filling", "spoken language understanding", "tokenizer preparation", "distributed training", "GPU", "NeMo", "BPE", "WPE", "experiment logging", "fine‑tuning"], "summary_hash": "18673b727360", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:41:24+00:00"}
