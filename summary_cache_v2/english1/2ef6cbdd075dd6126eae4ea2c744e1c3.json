{"summary": "The test suite validates the Marigold depth estimation and surface normal generation pipelines. It includes fast unit tests using lightweight dummy components and a tiny autoencoder to confirm basic functionality and configuration handling, as well as comprehensive integration tests that execute the full pipelines across various model components, schedulers, hardware targets, and numeric precisions, checking for consistent and correct depth and normal outputs under different guidance scales, inference steps, batch sizes, and image resolutions.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability and correctness of Marigold's depth and normal estimation services before they are integrated into computer‑vision products, enabling confident deployment across diverse hardware and precision settings.", "keywords": ["depth estimation", "surface normals", "pipeline testing", "unit tests", "integration tests", "hardware configurations", "numeric precision", "guidance scale", "inference steps", "batch size", "image resolution", "dummy components", "autoencoder"], "summary_hash": "0434e01db3bf", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:35:29+00:00"}
