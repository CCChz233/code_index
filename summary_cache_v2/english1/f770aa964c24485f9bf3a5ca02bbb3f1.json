{"summary": "Provides a stochastic vertical flip augmentation for 3‑D tensors (C, D, H, W) and batched inputs, with configurable probability, optional uniform application across a batch, and shape‑preserving options. When supplied with an accompanying transformation matrix, it updates the matrix to reflect the flip, enabling seamless integration in sequential transformation pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enhance the diversity of 3‑D image datasets—such as medical scans—during model training by applying random vertical flips in a differentiable manner, while maintaining correct spatial metadata for downstream processing.", "keywords": ["random vertical flip", "3D augmentation", "tensor batch handling", "probability", "same_on_batch", "keepdim", "transformation matrix", "torch", "differentiable", "5D tensor"], "summary_hash": "1c40aa446df6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:57:02+00:00"}
