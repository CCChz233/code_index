{"summary": "Implements a variational auto‑encoder that maps images to a low‑dimensional latent distribution using a KL‑regularized encoder and reconstructs images from those latents with a decoder. The architecture is configurable (channel sizes, block types, activation, attention) and includes utilities for scaling latents, handling high‑resolution inputs via upcasting, and optional tiled or sliced processing.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable latent representation layer for diffusion‑based image generation pipelines, enabling efficient encoding/decoding, high‑resolution support, and integration with downstream models that operate on scaled latent spaces.", "keywords": ["VAE", "KL loss", "encoder", "decoder", "latent space", "image compression", "diffusion models", "scaling factor", "attention", "upcasting", "tiling", "slicing", "high‑resolution", "latent diffusion"], "summary_hash": "8a8cb53cbbb6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:34:19+00:00"}
