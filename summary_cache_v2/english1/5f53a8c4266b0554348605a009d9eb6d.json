{"summary": "This module implements the conversion of Qiskit quantum circuits into OpenQASM 3.0 source code. It builds an abstract syntax tree that captures headers, includes, declarations, gate definitions, expressions, control‑flow statements, and quantum/classical instructions, manages naming scopes, and renders the tree to a string or file. Supporting utilities handle identifier escaping and a shared global namespace for reusable definitions.", "business_intent": "Provide a standards‑compliant exporter that allows Qiskit circuits to be serialized as OpenQASM 3.0, enabling circuit sharing, persistence, and execution on external quantum hardware or simulators that accept QASM3.", "keywords": ["OpenQASM 3", "exporter", "quantum circuit serialization", "Qiskit", "abstract syntax tree", "code generation", "gate definition", "control flow", "namespace management", "interoperability"], "summary_hash": "756e23aa8999", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:57:03+00:00"}
