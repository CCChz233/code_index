{"summary": "This module provides a suite of unit tests that validate how Dask arrays interact with CuPy when performing integer-based slicing and indexing. It covers a range of scenarios—including zero‑dimensional arrays, various data types, out‑of‑bounds errors, NaN chunks, negative indices, and lazy computation—to ensure that Dask's slicing semantics remain correct and consistent with NumPy behavior on GPU arrays.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of Dask's GPU‑accelerated array operations, thereby supporting reliable scientific and data‑analytics workloads that rely on CuPy for high‑performance computing.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "cupy", "slicing", "indexing", "unit tests", "GPU", "numpy compatibility", "edge cases", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "0809eda669af", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:22:29+00:00"}
