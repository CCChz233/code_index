{"summary": "The module provides a unit‑test suite that checks the behavior of MONAI's CacheDataset when data is accessed concurrently. It creates temporary NIfTI files, defines several test scenarios, and uses parameterized tests to verify that the cached dataset returns tensors with the expected shapes under parallel execution.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and stability of parallel data loading and caching in medical imaging workflows, ensuring that downstream models receive consistently shaped inputs even when multiple workers read from the cache simultaneously.", "keywords": ["CacheDataset", "parallel execution", "unit testing", "MONAI", "data caching", "shape verification", "NIfTI", "parameterized tests", "temporary files", "concurrency"], "summary_hash": "58461c124463", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:03:32+00:00"}
