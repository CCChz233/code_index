{"summary": "A comprehensive collection of unit tests that verify CuPy's ndarray advanced indexing behavior for both retrieval (getitem) and assignment (setitem). The tests cover a wide range of scenarios including integer and boolean indexing, parameterized cases, permutation and transpose handling, overflow conditions, dtype mismatches, scalar assignments, and proper error raising for invalid indices or values.", "business_intent": "Validate that CuPy's advanced indexing implementation matches NumPy's semantics and remains robust across diverse use cases, thereby ensuring reliable GPU-accelerated array operations for scientific computing and data processing applications.", "keywords": ["CuPy", "advanced indexing", "getitem", "setitem", "unit testing", "GPU arrays", "NumPy compatibility", "overflow handling", "dtype conversion", "boolean mask", "transpose", "error handling", "parameterized tests"], "summary_hash": "74dda2035716", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:25:49+00:00"}
