{"summary": "This module implements a configurable data loading pipeline that bridges Lhotse audio cut collections with PyTorch. It defines schema‑validated configuration objects, duration‑based filtering, multimodal sampling constraints, and utilities for preprocessing such as loudness normalization, channel selection, supervision merging, and tokenization. It also provides a factory function that builds an IterableDataset wrapped in a PyTorch DataLoader with support for dynamic bucketing, random seed handling, and optional CUDA‑expandable segments.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and engineers to efficiently load and preprocess large‑scale speech and multimodal audio datasets for training neural models, offering flexible sampling strategies, preprocessing options, and seamless integration with NeMo's training loops.", "keywords": ["Lhotse", "DataLoader", "PyTorch", "dynamic bucketing", "duration filter", "multimodal sampling", "configuration", "OmegaConf", "speech dataset", "audio preprocessing", "loudness normalization", "channel selection", "tokenization"], "summary_hash": "b8fdc01612f1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:54:01+00:00"}
