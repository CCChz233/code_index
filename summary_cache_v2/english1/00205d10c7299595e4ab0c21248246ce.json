{"summary": "The class acts as a pipeline node that gathers per‑case segmentation statistics and later produces a consolidated report. It accepts configurable keys for images and labels, optionally applies connected‑component processing, computes channel‑wise histograms with user‑defined bins and ranges, and can operate in histogram‑only mode. Internally it manages two kinds of analyzers: one that works on individual data dictionaries (similar to MONAI transforms) and another that aggregates the results from many cases to generate summary metrics.", "business_intent": "Enable automated, configurable statistical evaluation of 3D medical image segmentation workflows, allowing developers and researchers to collect detailed case‑level metrics and obtain overall performance summaries without manual coding.", "keywords": ["segmentation", "statistics", "histogram", "connected components", "data pipeline", "aggregation", "medical imaging", "Auto3Dseg", "transform"], "summary_hash": "e92d3bc9a6da", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:14:29+00:00"}
