{"summary": "The class evaluates 3‑dimensional segmentation results by comparing a predicted mask with a ground‑truth mask. It accounts for voxel spacing, optional removal of small objects, and overlap thresholds to classify each predicted object as true positive, false positive, or false negative. It then computes a set of quantitative measures such as volume differences, detection rates, and size‑specific labeling.", "business_intent": "Enable automated, detailed performance reporting of 3D image segmentation models—particularly in medical imaging—so developers and clinicians can assess accuracy, detect errors, and analyze results across object size ranges.", "keywords": ["3D segmentation", "evaluation metrics", "voxel resolution", "object labeling", "true positive rate", "false detection rate", "volume difference", "size filtering", "overlap criteria", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "31c637f60845", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:27:16+00:00"}
