{"summary": "This module provides a scheduler that implements a variance‑exploding stochastic differential equation (VE‑SDE) for the reverse diffusion process in diffusion models. It manages the noise scale schedule, maps timesteps to continuous sigma values, and performs the prediction‑correction steps needed to generate samples from a trained diffusion model, outputting the intermediate sample and its running mean.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient and high‑quality sample generation from diffusion‑based generative AI models, facilitating image or data synthesis pipelines that rely on stochastic differential equation solvers.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "stochastic differential equation", "variance exploding", "scheduler", "reverse diffusion", "sigma schedule", "timestep mapping", "prediction correction", "generative AI", "sampling", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "ac6827b11cbc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:12:31+00:00"}
