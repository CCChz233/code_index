{"summary": "This module adds a parameterized single‑qubit phase rotation gate and its controlled variants to the circuit library. The gates are diagonal, apply a phase e^{iλ} to the target qubit (or only when the control is |1⟩ for the controlled version), and can be implemented virtually as a frame change without physical error or duration.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to construct quantum circuits that require precise phase adjustments, offering both standalone and controlled phase operations that integrate seamlessly with the broader quantum computing framework.", "keywords": ["quantum gate", "phase rotation", "controlled phase", "diagonal gate", "Qiskit", "quantum circuit", "parameterized gate", "virtual implementation", "Z-axis rotation"], "summary_hash": "8dc26091ca20", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:12:54+00:00"}
