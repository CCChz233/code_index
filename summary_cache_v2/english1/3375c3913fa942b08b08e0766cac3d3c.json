{"summary": "The module offers utilities to reconfigure Megatron‑based language model checkpoints for a different number of tensor and pipeline partitions. It includes helpers for calculating split indices, generating split segments for GPT and T5 inputs, merging and splitting checkpoint files, adjusting virtual parallel ranks, and restoring model configurations within the NeMo framework.", "business_intent": "Allow users to adapt large pretrained Megatron language models to new hardware parallelism configurations, simplifying deployment, scaling, or fine‑tuning across varying numbers of GPUs or nodes.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "tensor parallelism", "pipeline parallelism", "checkpoint conversion", "GPT", "T5", "model partitioning", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "language modeling"], "summary_hash": "94dd040a40b8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:43:53+00:00"}
