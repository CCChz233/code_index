{"summary": "Applies random or fixed-size spatial cropping to one or more image tensors identified by keys, producing a configurable number of patch samples per input. Supports random or centered crop positions, variable ROI size ranges, and adds patch index metadata. Can operate lazily for deferred execution.", "business_intent": "Facilitates generation of diverse training patches from volumetric medical images, enabling data augmentation and efficient handling of large datasets in deep learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["random cropping", "fixed-size ROI", "patch extraction", "multiple samples", "dictionary transform", "lazy execution", "medical imaging", "data augmentation", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "48d21593ff57", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:04:42+00:00"}
