{"summary": "This module implements a collection of diffusion‑based pipelines for generating and transforming video content. It provides high‑level interfaces that encode text, images, or existing video into latent representations, run a 3‑D transformer denoising loop guided by a scheduler and optional control signals, and decode the refined latents back into video frames. The pipelines support text‑to‑video, text‑plus‑control, image‑to‑video, and video‑to‑video generation using a frozen T5 encoder, a variational auto‑encoder, and the CogVideoX diffusion model.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and media creators to produce synthetic video clips from textual descriptions, single images, or source videos, facilitating automated content creation, rapid prototyping, and creative workflows in entertainment, advertising, and digital media industries.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "video generation", "text-to-video", "image-to-video", "video-to-video", "AI", "generative model", "latent diffusion", "3D transformer", "scheduler", "VAE", "T5 encoder", "control"], "summary_hash": "caeb76843c98", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:43:20+00:00"}
