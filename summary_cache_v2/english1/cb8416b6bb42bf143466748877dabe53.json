{"summary": "The module provides a complete training pipeline for a text‑to‑image diffusion model using Flax/JAX. It loads a dataset, tokenizes captions, preprocesses images, initializes the VAE, UNet, text encoder, and schedulers, defines loss computation and a training step, runs the training loop with optimizer updates, handles checkpointing, and optionally uploads the resulting model to the Hugging Face hub.", "business_intent": "To enable developers and researchers to fine‑tune or train custom Stable Diffusion style text‑to‑image generators on their own data using high‑performance JAX/Flax, facilitating the creation of proprietary image generation services or research prototypes.", "keywords": ["Flax", "JAX", "Stable Diffusion", "text-to-image", "diffusion model", "training pipeline", "dataset preprocessing", "tokenizer", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "loss computation", "optimizer", "checkpointing", "Hugging Face"], "summary_hash": "a4b2250058de", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:05:30+00:00"}
