{"summary": "This module provides a collection of unit tests that validate the checkpoint migration utilities of the Lightning framework. The tests simulate legacy checkpoint structures and verify that the migration functions correctly update loop state, optimizer state, Apex AMP data, early stopping, and model checkpoint configurations to the current format, ensuring compatibility across framework versions.", "business_intent": "Guarantee seamless upgrades for users by confirming that older Lightning checkpoints can be automatically migrated to the latest version without loss of training state or functionality, thereby maintaining backward compatibility and reducing migration effort.", "keywords": ["migration", "checkpoint", "Lightning", "PyTorch", "unit test", "backward compatibility", "loop state", "optimizer", "Apex AMP", "early stopping", "model checkpoint", "version upgrade"], "summary_hash": "99abb09f1592", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:44:12+00:00"}
