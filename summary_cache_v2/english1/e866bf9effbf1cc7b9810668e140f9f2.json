{"summary": "Traverses the abstract syntax tree of a program, invoking each node's GIL verification routine to confirm that the Global Interpreter Lock is held when required and that Python operations are not performed in a nogil context. Detects and reports improper nesting of GIL and nogil blocks, aborting execution on violations.", "business_intent": "Provide static or runtime validation of GIL handling in parallel or multi‑threaded Python code, ensuring thread‑safe interaction with the Python interpreter and preventing crashes caused by incorrect GIL usage.", "keywords": ["GIL", "nogil", "AST traversal", "validation", "thread safety", "parallel execution", "error detection", "Python C API"], "summary_hash": "81064509c12d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:52:35+00:00"}
