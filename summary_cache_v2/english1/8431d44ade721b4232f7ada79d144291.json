{"summary": "Implements a transformation that randomly selects a region of an image tensor, optionally consistent across a batch, and resizes it to a target height and width. The crop size is sampled within configurable scale and aspect‑ratio ranges, and the operation supports different interpolation modes, a choice between fast slicing or differentiable resampling, probability control, and optional preservation of batch dimensions. An inverse operation reconstructs the original image region, merging with any provided affine matrix.", "business_intent": "Enhance computer‑vision model training by providing stochastic spatial augmentation that diversifies input data, helping models generalize better to variations in scale, aspect ratio, and cropping.", "keywords": ["random crop", "resize", "image augmentation", "tensor transformation", "scale range", "aspect ratio", "interpolation", "batch consistency", "differentiable cropping", "inverse transform", "affine matrix"], "summary_hash": "f4aca0b034c6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:55:49+00:00"}
