{"summary": "This module implements the calculations required for the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index system, providing functions to compute the drought code, duff moisture code, fine fuel moisture code, initial spread index, fire weather index and related auxiliary quantities. It includes logic for handling seasonal shutdown and startup of the indices based on temperature, precipitation and snow‑depth criteria, as well as utilities for day‑length factors and daily severity rating, all designed to work with xarray and dask data structures.", "business_intent": "Enable climate scientists and fire‑management professionals to assess fire danger and forecast fire behavior by deriving standardized fire weather indices from climate model or observational datasets.", "keywords": ["fire weather index", "Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index", "drought code", "duff moisture code", "fine fuel moisture code", "initial spread index", "fire risk assessment", "climate data analysis", "temperature", "precipitation", "snow depth", "seasonal shutdown", "startup logic", "day length factor", "xarray", "dask", "numba"], "summary_hash": "2ac7f7cecb9b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:32:31+00:00"}
