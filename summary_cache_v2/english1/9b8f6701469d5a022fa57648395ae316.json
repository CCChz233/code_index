{"summary": "The class processes a one‑dimensional signal and its time axis to identify events whose peaks lie between specified lower and upper thresholds. For each detected event it extracts a windowed segment, aligns them, and computes the conditional average waveform, variance, peak indices, arrival times, and inter‑event waiting times, while handling unit consistency and optional constraints such as minimum peak separation and removal of non‑maximal peaks.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers, especially in plasma physics, with a ready‑to‑use tool for conditional averaging of time‑series events, enabling statistical characterization of event shapes, timing, and variability for diagnostic and modeling purposes.", "keywords": ["conditional averaging", "event detection", "peak detection", "time series analysis", "thresholding", "signal processing", "variance calculation", "arrival time", "waiting time", "plasma diagnostics"], "summary_hash": "4c0b8e3ff82c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:58:47+00:00"}
