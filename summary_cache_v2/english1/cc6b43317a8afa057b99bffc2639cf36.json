{"summary": "The module implements algorithms to decompose 2‑qubit and 3‑qubit Clifford operators into a sequence of elementary quantum gates, constructing a QuantumCircuit representation. It includes helper routines for evaluating CX gate costs, rank calculations, and cost reduction, culminating in a public synthesis function that produces an optimized Clifford circuit.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable, low‑overhead method for compiling small Clifford operations into executable quantum circuits, supporting quantum algorithm development, error‑correction code implementation, and performance‑critical simulation workloads.", "keywords": ["Clifford", "circuit synthesis", "decomposition", "quantum circuit", "2-qubit", "3-qubit", "gate optimization", "CX cost", "Bravyi-Maslov", "quantum compilation"], "summary_hash": "ef2b852950f8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:58:56+00:00"}
