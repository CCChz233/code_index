{"summary": "The module defines a generic serializer interface and concrete implementations that transform Python objects to byte streams and back. It includes JSON‑based, pickle‑based, and compressed variants, handling encoding, optional compression, base64 safety, and version tracking to support reliable object persistence and transmission within the Prefect ecosystem.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, version‑aware mechanism for serializing and deserializing workflow data, configuration, and results so they can be stored, transferred between processes, or replayed across different Prefect deployments.", "keywords": ["serialization", "JSON", "pickle", "compression", "base64", "byte conversion", "Prefect", "data persistence", "compatibility", "abstract base class"], "summary_hash": "c8ec9f96b2e8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:24:02+00:00"}
