{"summary": "The module implements a linear evaluation pipeline for node embeddings generated by a graph representation learning model. It prepares labels, splits data, trains logistic regression classifiers (including one‑vs‑rest and hyper‑parameter search), computes predictions, and reports performance metrics such as F1 scores.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream assessment of learned graph embeddings by providing a ready‑to‑use evaluation routine that quantifies how well the embeddings support node classification tasks.", "keywords": ["node embeddings", "linear evaluation", "logistic regression", "node classification", "F1 score", "train-test split", "grid search", "one‑vs‑rest", "graph representation learning", "GRACE"], "summary_hash": "46a95389b831", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:15:48+00:00"}
