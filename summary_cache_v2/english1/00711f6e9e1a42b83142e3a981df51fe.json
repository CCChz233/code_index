{"summary": "Provides a plugin system for synchronizing the state of model layers across multiple processes during distributed PyTorch training, including a ready‑to‑use implementation that automatically wraps batch‑normalization layers to keep their running statistics aligned across workers while acting as a no‑op on single‑device runs.", "business_intent": "Ensures consistent model performance and reproducibility in large‑scale, multi‑GPU or multi‑node training pipelines, reducing divergence caused by unsynchronized batch‑norm statistics and simplifying the integration of custom layer‑synchronization logic.", "keywords": ["distributed training", "PyTorch", "layer synchronization", "batch normalization", "plugin architecture", "multi‑process", "state consistency", "no‑op fallback", "utility functions"], "summary_hash": "6bfa03d344f5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:13:04+00:00"}
