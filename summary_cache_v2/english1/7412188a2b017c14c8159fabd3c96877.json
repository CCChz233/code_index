{"summary": "Provides dummy ONNX‑based Stable Diffusion pipeline classes that simulate model loading, configuration handling, and inference for various tasks (text‑to‑image, img2img, inpainting, upscaling) to allow the library to be imported without requiring the actual torch, transformers, or ONNX runtimes.", "business_intent": "Offer a lightweight fallback that lets developers test, document, or deploy code in environments lacking heavy deep‑learning dependencies, ensuring compatibility and reducing setup overhead.", "keywords": ["ONNX", "Stable Diffusion", "pipeline", "image generation", "inpainting", "img2img", "upscaling", "dummy objects", "fallback", "lightweight", "model loading", "inference"], "summary_hash": "98f2f0077cb8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:10:30+00:00"}
