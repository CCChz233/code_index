{"summary": "Implements a generic, extensible factory mechanism for constructing PyTorch layers in a dimension‑independent way. A central registry maps symbolic names to callables that return layer classes or instances, and helper factories expose common layer types (convolution, pooling, normalization, activation, etc.) so that networks can request a layer by name and required arguments such as spatial dimension.", "business_intent": "Provide MONAI users with a flexible, configurable way to build medical imaging neural networks where layer types can be swapped or parameterized without changing model code, supporting multi‑dimensional data and optional optimizations.", "keywords": ["factory pattern", "layer creation", "dynamic registration", "dimension‑agnostic", "convolution", "pooling", "normalization", "activation", "dropout", "PyTorch", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "2b509c9e8e75", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:16:15+00:00"}
