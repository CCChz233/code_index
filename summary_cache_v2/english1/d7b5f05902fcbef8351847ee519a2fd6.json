{"summary": "Implements an optimized attention mechanism for BART models by leveraging the flash attention API while keeping the original attention weights unchanged. The class reshapes inputs, pads/unpads sequences as needed, and executes the efficient attention computation during the forward pass.", "business_intent": "Boost the speed and memory efficiency of BART-based applications such as text generation, summarization, or translation, enabling faster inference and training on large inputs.", "keywords": ["BART", "flash attention", "efficient attention", "transformer", "padding handling", "performance optimization", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "736ceef185f4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:57:02+00:00"}
