{"summary": "This module implements a transformation class that encapsulates Substrait query plans for Feast feature data. It handles conversion between Substrait protobuf representations and Feast's high‑level abstractions, infers schemas, provisions tables, and executes the transformations using Arrow or Ibis backends.", "business_intent": "Enable Feast users to define and run complex data processing logic via Substrait, leveraging efficient Arrow/Ibis execution and seamless type mapping between Feast, pandas, and pyarrow, thereby extending the feature engineering capabilities of the Feast SDK.", "keywords": ["Substrait", "Feast", "transformation", "schema inference", "Arrow", "Ibis", "protobuf", "type mapping", "feature engineering", "data pipeline"], "summary_hash": "f447a74cda23", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:25:31+00:00"}
