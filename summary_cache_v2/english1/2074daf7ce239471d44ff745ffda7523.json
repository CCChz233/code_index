{"summary": "The module provides neural‑network compatible video augmentation utilities for multimodal speech‑visual models. It supports spatial masking of individual frames, temporal masking of consecutive frames, and a generic augmentation pipeline that operates on batched video tensors (B, C, T, H, W). Masked regions can be filled with the video’s mean pixel values, and mask parameters are configurable to simulate realistic variations.", "business_intent": "Enhance the robustness and generalization of visual speech recognition and related speech‑computer‑vision systems by augmenting training video data with realistic spatial and temporal distortions.", "keywords": ["video augmentation", "spatial masking", "temporal masking", "mean pixel fill", "batch video tensor", "multimodal speech", "visual speech recognition", "data augmentation", "PyTorch", "NeuralModule"], "summary_hash": "6507847cf6ec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:59:09+00:00"}
