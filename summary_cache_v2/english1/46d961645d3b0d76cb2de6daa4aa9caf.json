{"summary": "Defines a collection of helper utilities and factory functions that assemble and manage the sequence of compilation stages used by the Cython compiler. It orchestrates tasks such as parsing source files, injecting utility code, generating Cython-to-C code, handling errors, and recording timing information, offering configurable pipelines for different file types (.py, .pyx, .pxd).", "business_intent": "Enable a modular, extensible compilation workflow for Cython projects, allowing the build system to construct tailored pipelines that transform source code into compiled extensions while providing diagnostics and performance metrics.", "keywords": ["Cython", "compiler", "pipeline", "stage factory", "parsing", "code generation", "utility code injection", "error handling", "timing", "build process", "modular architecture"], "summary_hash": "cacf97bf12c0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:26:17+00:00"}
