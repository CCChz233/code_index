{"summary": "The module implements data augmentation utilities for the Imagen multimodal dataset, primarily providing a transformation that loads pre‑computed feature encodings from pickle files, converts them into PyTorch tensors, and adjusts their spatial dimensions through padding and resizing to match the expected generator configuration, while also generating a validity mask.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient preprocessing of pre‑computed image representations for training and inference of large‑scale multimodal generative models, reducing runtime computation and ensuring compatibility with model input requirements.", "keywords": ["data augmentation", "precomputed encodings", "pickle loading", "tensor conversion", "padding", "resizing", "validity mask", "multimodal", "Imagen", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "8965d62407fa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:05:53+00:00"}
