{"summary": "A neural network layer that enlarges the spatial dimensions of an input tensor by repeating or interpolating its values, with an optional convolution to refine the upscaled features. It supports 1‑D, 2‑D, and 3‑D data, adapting its operation based on the specified dimensionality.", "business_intent": "Enable models to increase resolution of feature maps during decoding or generative stages, improving detail reconstruction while optionally learning a smoothing or sharpening filter via convolution.", "keywords": ["upsampling", "optional convolution", "1D", "2D", "3D", "feature map scaling", "neural network layer", "resolution enhancement"], "summary_hash": "8ce054efc46d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:56:47+00:00"}
