{"summary": "The tracing package equips Metaflow with end‑to‑end distributed tracing capabilities. It initializes OpenTelemetry, injects and extracts trace context across execution environments, provides decorators that automatically create spans around workflow steps, and configures exporters for console, OpenTelemetry, or Zipkin backends. It also includes utilities for CLI integration, environment‑variable handling, and post‑fork reinitialization while respecting enable/disable flags.", "business_intent": "To give Metaflow users visibility into the performance and behavior of their data pipelines, facilitating monitoring, debugging, and root‑cause analysis across distributed and multi‑process executions by integrating with standard tracing systems.", "keywords": ["tracing", "OpenTelemetry", "Metaflow", "distributed tracing", "context propagation", "span exporter", "workflow step decorator", "observability", "monitoring", "Zipkin", "CLI integration", "environment variables"], "summary_hash": "072629f38b67", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:21:34+00:00"}
