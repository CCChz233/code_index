{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that combines a UNet denoiser with a Score SDE variance‑exploding scheduler to synthesize images from random noise without any conditioning. The class manages model loading, device placement, and the inference loop that iteratively denoises the latent tensor and returns the final images.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to generate high‑quality synthetic images using a score‑based diffusion approach, supporting applications such as creative content creation, data augmentation, and experimentation with unconditional generative models.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "score-based", "SDE", "variance exploding", "UNet", "image synthesis", "unconditional generation", "pipeline", "torch", "synthetic data"], "summary_hash": "d79a266e6058", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:27:11+00:00"}
