{"summary": "The module demonstrates a complete training workflow for a simple image classification model using Lightning Fabric. It shows how to instantiate the Fabric object, eliminate manual device placement, configure models, optimizers, and data loaders through Fabric's setup utilities, replace the standard backward call with Fabric's backward method, and execute the script via the Fabric command-line interface with accelerator and device options.", "business_intent": "Guide developers in adopting Lightning Fabric to accelerate and scale PyTorch training pipelines, reducing boilerplate code for device management and enabling easy distributed or multi‑device execution.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "Lightning Fabric", "training loop", "image classification", "MNIST", "distributed training", "accelerator", "device management", "model setup", "optimizer", "dataloader"], "summary_hash": "883044f49ed5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:50:51+00:00"}
