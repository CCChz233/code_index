{"summary": "The module supplies a data access layer for simulation tools, offering utilities to fetch array elements from MongoDB, a mock handler that reads model parameters directly from repository files, and a high‑level handler that abstracts MongoDB interactions such as collection access, bulk writes, versioned document management, GridFS storage, and thread‑safe operations.", "business_intent": "Provide simulation applications with a flexible and efficient mechanism to retrieve, store, and manage model data, supporting both real MongoDB backends and file‑based mock sources while handling versioning, bulk operations, and concurrency safely.", "keywords": ["MongoDB", "simulation data", "array retrieval", "mock repository handler", "GridFS", "bulk write", "versioned documents", "thread safety", "data access layer"], "summary_hash": "56e5eed3b214", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:55:37+00:00"}
