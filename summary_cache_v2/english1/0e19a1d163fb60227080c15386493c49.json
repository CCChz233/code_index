{"summary": "A comprehensive test module that verifies JAX's NumPy‑style indexing and indexed update semantics. It exercises basic slicing, advanced integer and boolean indexing, ellipsis handling, static out‑of‑bounds checks, gradient propagation, batching, type promotion, and segment reduction behavior across JAX and NumPy backends.", "business_intent": "Provide regression‑proof validation of JAX's indexing implementation to guarantee NumPy compatibility, ensure numerical correctness, and support reliable development of JAX‑based machine‑learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["JAX", "NumPy indexing", "unit testing", "advanced indexing", "static indexing", "gradient checking", "batching", "type casting", "error handling", "array updates", "segment reduction"], "summary_hash": "59ac2332ce29", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:04:10+00:00"}
