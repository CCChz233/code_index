{"summary": "The test suite validates the Flux ControlNet diffusion pipelines—including standard generation, image‑to‑image, and inpainting variants—through a combination of fast unit tests with mocked components and slower end‑to‑end executions on real inputs such as Canny edges. It checks integration of ControlNet, attention forwarding, prompt handling, fused QKV projections, conditioning scale effects, batch processing, and GPU‑dependent deterministic behavior.", "business_intent": "Provide comprehensive automated verification of Flux ControlNet pipelines to guarantee functional correctness, performance stability, and reliable behavior across different generation modes before deployment, supporting continuous integration and quality assurance.", "keywords": ["Flux", "ControlNet", "diffusion pipeline", "unit tests", "integration tests", "mock models", "Canny edge", "image-to-image", "inpainting", "attention forwarding", "prompt embeddings", "conditioning scale", "batch inference", "GPU", "deterministic"], "summary_hash": "8e7a346910fd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:33:51+00:00"}
