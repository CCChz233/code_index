{"summary": "A command‑line utility that fine‑tunes the Stable Diffusion InstructPix2Pix model by adding low‑rank (LoRA) adapters to the UNet. It parses user options, loads and preprocesses image‑instruction datasets, configures the diffusion pipeline, runs a distributed training loop with Accelerate, logs metrics (optionally to Weights & Biases), saves checkpoints, and optionally pushes the resulting model to the Hugging Face Hub.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and developers with an easy way to adapt the InstructPix2Pix image‑editing model to specific domains (e.g., cartoonization) using lightweight LoRA weights, accelerating experimentation and deployment of customized text‑to‑image editing solutions.", "keywords": ["InstructPix2Pix", "LoRA", "Stable Diffusion", "image editing", "fine‑tuning", "low‑rank adaptation", "distributed training", "Accelerate", "dataset preprocessing", "checkpointing", "Hugging Face Hub", "Weights & Biases", "custom AI model"], "summary_hash": "0c5db05c9560", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:37:58+00:00"}
