{"summary": "This module defines a model that converts table structure predictions into a visual layout. It computes cell positions, draws table borders and cell outlines on images, and exposes a callable interface to generate rendered representations of tables within document pages.", "business_intent": "To provide a reliable way to visualize and validate detected tables in document processing pipelines, facilitating quality checks, debugging of table detection models, and downstream data extraction workflows.", "keywords": ["table rendering", "visualization", "document analysis", "cell bounding boxes", "table structure prediction", "image drawing", "model inference", "quality assurance"], "summary_hash": "8c0dfb2180e8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:38:38+00:00"}
