{"summary": "This module defines a unit‑test suite that verifies the behavior of MONAI CuCIM image transformation utilities. It runs the same transformation logic on both GPU (CuPy) and CPU (NumPy) back‑ends, testing single‑image and batch cases for operations such as color jitter, flipping, rotation, intensity scaling, and zoom.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that CuCIM‑based preprocessing transforms produce consistent and correct results across hardware platforms, supporting reliable medical imaging pipelines that may run on either GPU or CPU.", "keywords": ["CuCIM", "MONAI", "image transforms", "GPU", "CuPy", "CPU", "NumPy", "unit testing", "parameterized tests", "medical imaging", "augmentation", "determinism"], "summary_hash": "80eb94bd6340", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:58:52+00:00"}
