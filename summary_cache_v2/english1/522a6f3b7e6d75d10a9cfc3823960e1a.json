{"summary": "The module defines unit tests that verify the correct construction of simulated quantum backends, ensuring that version‑2 fake devices consistently include a noise model and that utility routines properly parse keyword arguments. It also supplies a helper to generate a simple quantum circuit used in the tests.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the fake backend infrastructure behaves as expected, providing reliable simulated hardware for developers and researchers to test quantum algorithms without real devices.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "fake quantum backend", "noise model verification", "Qiskit", "quantum circuit generation", "keyword argument handling", "simulation reliability"], "summary_hash": "390a78b41dc7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:01:50+00:00"}
