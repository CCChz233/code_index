{"summary": "The module defines a Meshing utility class that encapsulates ANSYS MAPDL pre‑processor commands for creating, editing, and querying mesh structures. It offers methods to set element sizes, refine or clear meshes, copy mesh data, adjust element orientation, and generate patterned meshes.", "business_intent": "Enable engineers and analysts to programmatically control mesh generation and manipulation within ANSYS MAPDL through a Python interface, streamlining the setup of finite‑element models for simulation workflows.", "keywords": ["mesh", "meshing", "ANSYS", "MAPDL", "preprocessor", "finite element", "mesh sizing", "refinement", "orientation", "pattern generation", "simulation"], "summary_hash": "c72afcf7bb1b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:04:15+00:00"}
