{"summary": "A model that augments a GPT architecture with lightweight adapter modules inserted into each transformer layer, enabling task‑specific fine‑tuning while keeping the original GPT weights frozen. After training, only the adapter parameters are persisted and can be re‑applied to the same base model for inference.", "business_intent": "Provide a resource‑efficient way for enterprises to adapt large language models to custom tasks without retraining the entire model, reducing computational cost and storage while maintaining performance.", "keywords": ["adapter", "GPT", "fine-tuning", "transfer learning", "transformer", "task-specific", "parameter efficient", "model compression", "Megatron", "Houlsby", "inference", "weight loading"], "summary_hash": "e02ead8243d4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:06:36+00:00"}
