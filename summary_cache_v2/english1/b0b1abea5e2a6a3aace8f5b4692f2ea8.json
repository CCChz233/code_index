{"summary": "A utility that walks a parse tree from the leaves upward, invoking user‑defined callbacks for each node type to produce a new tree (or modify the existing one). It automatically handles missing callbacks by copying nodes and allows nodes to be removed by returning a discard marker. Optional token visitation and in‑place variants give flexibility for performance and mutation strategies.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to implement custom transformations, optimizations, or analyses on syntax trees generated by a parser, supporting map/reduce style processing and easy integration into language tooling or data pipelines.", "keywords": ["tree transformation", "bottom‑up traversal", "parse tree", "visitor pattern", "callback", "node rewriting", "token handling", "in‑place modification", "discard", "map‑reduce"], "summary_hash": "dc7180de070e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:59:31+00:00"}
