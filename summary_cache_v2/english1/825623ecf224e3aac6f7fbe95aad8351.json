{"summary": "The module implements a training pipeline for a diffusion‑based image inpainting model. It defines a dataset class that loads paired source and target images with corresponding masks, applies preprocessing and tokenization, and supplies batches for fine‑tuning. Helper utilities handle data collation, model checkpoint loading/saving, validation logging, and argument parsing. The main routine orchestrates distributed training using Accelerate, configures the Stable Diffusion inpainting pipeline, applies optional LoRA adapters, runs the training loop with schedulers and optimizers, and periodically evaluates and saves the model.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use solution for customizing and fine‑tuning diffusion inpainting models on proprietary image collections, enabling businesses to create domain‑specific image completion capabilities with minimal engineering effort.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "inpainting", "fine‑tuning", "LoRA", "diffusion model", "dataset", "mask generation", "accelerate", "distributed training", "PyTorch", "image preprocessing", "checkpointing", "validation logging"], "summary_hash": "e2bffb0602fb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:07:43+00:00"}
