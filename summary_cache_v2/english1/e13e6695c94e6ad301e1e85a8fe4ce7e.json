{"summary": "A lightweight container that groups together scalar register values representing a pseudo‑random number generator (PRNG) key during the compiler's lowering phase. It stores a list of scalar OpResult objects, enabling the key to be passed around and returned as multiple scalar values where the load_op primitive only supports a single result.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the handling of PRNG key material in scalar registers during code lowering, ensuring correct data flow and compatibility with primitives that cannot return multiple values.", "keywords": ["PRNG", "key", "scalar registers", "bundle", "lowering pass", "OpResult", "compiler", "load_op", "data container"], "summary_hash": "df75183adfd1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:44:31+00:00"}
