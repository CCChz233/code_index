It defines helper classes that construct and interpret prompts for generating cron expressions, interval values, and recurrence‑rule strings, including timezone selection, as well as a central handler for entrypoint prompts. It also offers generic helpers for rendering tables, confirming actions, and prompting for work‑pool creation, Docker image configuration, and other deployment‑related inputs, leveraging Rich for rich console output.", "business_intent": "Enable users to configure Prefect deployments, schedules, and infrastructure components through an intuitive, guided CLI experience, optionally leveraging AI‑generated suggestions, thereby simplifying setup and reducing manual input errors.", "keywords": ["prompting", "CLI", "schedule", "cron", "interval", "rrule", "timezone", "entrypoint", "work pool", "docker image", "table", "confirm", "rich", "user input", "Prefect", "deployment", "AI model"], "summary_hash": "ad8b0d28247e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:59:50+00:00"}
