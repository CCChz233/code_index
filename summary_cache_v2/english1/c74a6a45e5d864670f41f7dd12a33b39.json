{"summary": "The module defines a set of classes that compute and analyse evapotranspiration within a water‑quality modeling framework. It validates inputs, renders results with templating, and supports repeated stress‑scenario evaluation across different soil layers, including the most active layer, generic layers, and the top layer, while integrating boundary‑condition handling and numerical operations.", "business_intent": "Enable environmental and water‑resource analysts to simulate and assess evapotranspiration dynamics across soil profiles for water‑balance studies, scenario planning, and regulatory reporting.", "keywords": ["evapotranspiration", "soil layers", "water balance", "environmental modeling", "boundary condition", "numpy", "jinja2", "scenario analysis", "water quality", "soil moisture"], "summary_hash": "1883e854a8e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:47:04+00:00"}
