{"summary": "The module implements container classes for representing quantum measurement outcome data. It supplies a validated probability distribution type that can be inspected, converted to vectors, and interpreted in binary or hexadecimal outcome spaces, as well as a quasiprobability distribution type that supports normalization, conversion to standard probabilities, and arithmetic needed for error‑mitigation and analysis of noisy measurement results.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum‑computing applications to process and analyze execution results by providing robust, easy‑to‑use abstractions for probability and quasiprobability data, facilitating tasks such as result validation, outcome conversion, and error‑mitigation calculations.", "keywords": ["quantum", "measurement", "probability distribution", "quasiprobability", "validation", "conversion", "error mitigation", "arithmetic", "binary outcomes", "hexadecimal outcomes"], "summary_hash": "608b8c915dd5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:05:12+00:00"}
