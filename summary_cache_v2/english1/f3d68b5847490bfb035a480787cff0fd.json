{"summary": "This module supplies a collection of helper utilities for configuring and managing PyTorch DataLoaders within the Lightning Fabric framework. It includes a lightweight attribute-access dictionary, wrappers for method and attribute handling, and a suite of functions that resolve sampler settings, adjust initialization arguments, set epoch values for samplers, detect iterable datasets, and compute resource-based defaults such as the number of workers. The utilities aim to streamline DataLoader preparation for both single‑node and distributed training environments.", "business_intent": "Enable Lightning Fabric users to set up robust, efficient data pipelines with minimal boilerplate, ensuring correct handling of samplers, worker initialization, and resource allocation across diverse hardware and distributed configurations.", "keywords": ["DataLoader", "sampler", "worker initialization", "attribute dictionary", "method wrapping", "iterable dataset detection", "CPU count", "max workers suggestion", "distributed training", "PyTorch", "Lightning Fabric"], "summary_hash": "c74453186702", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:03:07+00:00"}
