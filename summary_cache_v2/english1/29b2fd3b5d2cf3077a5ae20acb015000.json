{"summary": "Provides a Python wrapper around the Modflow 6 DLL (libMF6.dll) exposing the XMI API, allowing users to query and modify internal model arrays—such as constant‑head boundary data and flow terms—while a simulation is running. Configuration options control whether boundary information and flow rates are printed or saved to output files, and the package can be attached to both flow and transport simulations.", "business_intent": "Facilitate real‑time interaction with a Modflow 6 model for advanced coupling, custom monitoring, and on‑the‑fly adjustments, thereby supporting more flexible groundwater modeling workflows and downstream analysis pipelines.", "keywords": ["Modflow 6", "XMI API", "DLL interface", "internal model arrays", "constant head boundaries", "flow reporting", "simulation coupling", "Python wrapper", "libMF6", "groundwater modeling"], "summary_hash": "ba21062fc125", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:37:48+00:00"}
