{"summary": "This module defines a generic dataset wrapper for NeMo multimodal models that abstracts the loading and iteration of WebDataset shards, handling local and S3 sources, distributed partitioning, size reporting, and deterministic shuffling. It also provides a utility for reproducible random ordering of samples.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable and reproducible data ingestion pipelines for training and evaluating large‑scale multimodal AI models across distributed environments.", "keywords": ["webdataset", "multimodal", "data loading", "distributed training", "deterministic shuffle", "S3", "NeMo", "iterable dataset", "size reporting", "data pipeline"], "summary_hash": "bd7d92cab5a7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:05:18+00:00"}
