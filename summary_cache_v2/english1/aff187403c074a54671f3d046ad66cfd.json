{"summary": "Provides a set of configuration classes that describe how attention matrices should be sparsified in transformer models. Includes abstract and concrete configurations for dense, fixed, variable, and model‑specific (e.g., Longformer, BigBird) block‑sparse patterns, along with utilities to build and manipulate these layouts.", "business_intent": "Allows developers to define and experiment with different sparse attention schemes to reduce memory and compute costs of self‑attention, improving scalability and performance of large transformer architectures.", "keywords": ["sparsity", "attention", "transformer", "configuration", "block-sparse", "dense", "variable", "fixed", "Longformer", "BigBird", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "8d6c95ff18ed", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:30:54+00:00"}
