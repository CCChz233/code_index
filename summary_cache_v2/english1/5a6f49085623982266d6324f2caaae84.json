{"summary": "This module implements algorithms to synthesize quantum circuits that prepare stabilizer states. It converts a stabilizer description into a sequence of Clifford operations, builds an intermediate graph state, and decomposes it into layers of gates, optionally optimizing for linear nearest‑neighbor connectivity and circuit depth.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum software developers and researchers to generate efficient, hardware‑aware circuits for stabilizer state preparation, facilitating simulation, benchmarking, and execution on quantum processors.", "keywords": ["stabilizer", "circuit synthesis", "quantum circuit", "Clifford decomposition", "graph state", "CZ synthesis", "linear nearest neighbor", "depth optimization", "Qiskit", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "fd4b8e3ccada", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:58:37+00:00"}
