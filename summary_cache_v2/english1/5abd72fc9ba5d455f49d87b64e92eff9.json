{"summary": "A configuration container that encapsulates all architectural and training hyperparameters required to build a ConvBERT transformer model, including vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, layer count, attention heads, convolution kernel size, dropout rates, initialization range, and layer‑norm epsilon. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate a ConvBERT model with the specified settings.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to define, customize, and reproduce ConvBERT model architectures for natural language processing tasks, facilitating easy model creation and integration within the Transformers ecosystem.", "keywords": ["configuration", "ConvBERT", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "model architecture", "vocabulary size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "convolution kernel", "dropout", "layer normalization", "pretrained"], "summary_hash": "c6de741e4554", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:05:44+00:00"}
