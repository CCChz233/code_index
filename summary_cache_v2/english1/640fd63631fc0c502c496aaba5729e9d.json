{"summary": "Provides example training scripts that implement the Contrastive Tension (CT) method with in‑batch negative sampling to learn sentence embeddings in an unsupervised manner. The scripts load raw sentence corpora (e.g., AskUbuntu), construct dual encoders, apply a contrastive loss, manage training loops with logging, checkpointing, and evaluate the resulting embeddings on semantic similarity benchmarks.", "business_intent": "Showcase how to generate high‑quality sentence representations that can be used to improve performance on downstream tasks such as semantic textual similarity, duplicate question detection, and other natural‑language understanding applications.", "keywords": ["unsupervised learning", "sentence embeddings", "contrastive learning", "in‑batch negatives", "CT", "dual encoders", "SentenceTransformer", "training script", "semantic similarity", "AskUbuntu"], "summary_hash": "005aa64d42ab", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:00:27+00:00"}
