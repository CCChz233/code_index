{"summary": "The module implements a suite of high‑level array operations that mirror NumPy's API but operate on Dask arrays. It supplies lazy, blockwise implementations for reshaping, stacking, broadcasting, reductions, histograms, and other common manipulations, handling chunked data and integrating with Dask's high‑level graph execution.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, out‑of‑core data processing by offering familiar NumPy‑style functions that automatically distribute work across multiple cores or machines, allowing analysts and engineers to work with datasets larger than memory while preserving a simple, declarative programming model.", "keywords": ["Dask", "array", "parallel", "lazy evaluation", "NumPy compatibility", "blockwise computation", "chunked data", "high‑level graph", "out‑of‑core processing", "data analysis"], "summary_hash": "b58e19244ea7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:18:00+00:00"}
