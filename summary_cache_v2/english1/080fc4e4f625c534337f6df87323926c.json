{"summary": "The module provides an implementation of the Graph Attention Network v2 (GATv2) layer using DGL's optimized convolution, along with a training script that applies this layer to standard citation graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed). It leverages sparse matrix‑vector multiplication and multi‑head attention for efficient node feature aggregation, and includes early‑stopping to avoid overfitting.", "business_intent": "To offer a ready‑to‑use, high‑performance example for researchers and engineers who need to apply or benchmark advanced graph attention models on citation networks, facilitating rapid experimentation and performance evaluation of GATv2 in PyTorch/DGL environments.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "GATv2", "attention mechanism", "DGL", "PyTorch", "sparse matrix multiplication", "citation datasets", "node classification", "early stopping"], "summary_hash": "e2087066c44c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:53:45+00:00"}
