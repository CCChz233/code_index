{"summary": "The module defines a solver that coordinates multiple connection solvers to resolve complex relationships between infrastructure resources. It aggregates solvers, removes duplicate or irrelevant outcomes, orders them appropriately, and applies attribute-specific logic to produce final connection results.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate detection of intricate resource connections in infrastructure-as-code scans, supporting security and compliance assessments by handling sophisticated graph relationships.", "keywords": ["complex connection solving", "solver orchestration", "attribute solvers", "connection solvers", "filtering duplicates", "sorting solvers", "infrastructure analysis", "IaC security", "graph-based checks", "compliance validation"], "summary_hash": "a67f26d27380", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T19:46:23+00:00"}
