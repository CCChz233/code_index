{"summary": "This module provides utilities to transform raw audio files into a structured supervised dataset for self‑supervised text‑to‑speech training. It defines a dataset abstraction that loads waveforms, computes mel‑spectrograms and pitch contours, validates pitch values, segments audio into manageable chunks, and saves the resulting feature representations and metadata for downstream model training.", "business_intent": "Enable automated preparation of high‑quality acoustic training data for SSL‑based TTS systems, facilitating feature extraction, validation, and organization of audio resources to accelerate model development and fine‑tuning.", "keywords": ["audio processing", "mel spectrogram", "pitch extraction", "data segmentation", "dataset preparation", "self‑supervised TTS", "feature extraction", "multiprocessing", "training data generation"], "summary_hash": "2a40718099d4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:44:28+00:00"}
