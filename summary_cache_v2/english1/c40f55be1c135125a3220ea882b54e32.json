{"summary": "Applies random rectangular occlusions to an image and optionally its associated mask, with configurable number, size, and fill strategies (constant, per‑pixel random, per‑hole random, or OpenCV inpainting). The transformation also updates related annotations such as bounding boxes and keypoints to reflect the dropped regions.", "business_intent": "Enhance model robustness by augmenting training data with realistic occlusions and varying object scales, helping computer‑vision systems handle missing or obstructed visual information.", "keywords": ["data augmentation", "occlusion simulation", "random dropout", "cutout", "random erasing", "inpainting", "image mask", "bounding box adjustment", "keypoint handling", "computer vision robustness"], "summary_hash": "4c0705dd7ed3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:24:32+00:00"}
