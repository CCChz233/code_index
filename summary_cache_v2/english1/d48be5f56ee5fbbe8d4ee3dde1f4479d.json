{"summary": "Provides a synthesis driver that converts any two‑qubit unitary into an optimal sequence of native XX‑type (CAN(α,0,0)) gates. It evaluates interaction strengths using fidelity data, polytope geometry, and Weyl decomposition, selecting the best circuit embodiment and optionally falling back to a secondary optimizer. Includes a utility for computing average infidelity of candidate circuits.", "business_intent": "Allows quantum software developers and compiler engineers to generate hardware‑efficient, high‑fidelity two‑qubit gate implementations for devices whose native entangling operation is an XX interaction, thereby improving overall circuit performance and reducing error rates.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit synthesis", "two‑qubit decomposition", "XX gate optimization", "fidelity‑aware compilation", "Weyl decomposition", "polytope analysis", "native gate set", "infidelity calculation", "quantum compilation"], "summary_hash": "d0c80b0944f9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:01:35+00:00"}
