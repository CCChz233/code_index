{"summary": "Provides high‑level pipelines that combine Stable Diffusion (including the XL variant) with a lightweight ControlNet‑XS adapter to generate images from textual prompts and additional visual conditioning. The pipelines manage tokenization, dual CLIP text encoding, VAE latent encoding/decoding, UNet denoising, scheduler stepping, safety checking, optional watermarking, and allow model extensions such as LoRA weights and textual inversion embeddings.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to produce customized, high‑quality images from text and auxiliary visual cues while supporting flexible model fine‑tuning and safety mechanisms, facilitating integration of advanced diffusion models into applications.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "text-to-image", "ControlNet-XS", "Stable Diffusion", "Stable Diffusion XL", "image generation", "UNet", "VAE", "CLIP", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "safety checker", "watermark", "pipeline"], "summary_hash": "f47e9340c356", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:41:09+00:00"}
