{"summary": "The module implements an evaluator that measures the classification accuracy of a sentence‑transformer model on a labeled dataset. It loads data in batches, moves inputs to the appropriate device, obtains model logits assuming a softmax loss, computes the proportion of correct predictions, and appends the resulting accuracy metrics to a CSV file for later analysis.", "business_intent": "To provide a reliable way to quantify and record the performance of embedding models on supervised labeling tasks, supporting model validation, comparison, and continuous monitoring during development and training pipelines.", "keywords": ["evaluation", "accuracy", "classification", "softmax", "CSV logging", "sentence transformers", "model performance", "data loader", "batch processing"], "summary_hash": "62c40230eedb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:55:42+00:00"}
