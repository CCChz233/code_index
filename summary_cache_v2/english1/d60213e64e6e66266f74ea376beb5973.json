{"summary": "The repository offers a complete reference implementation of the Hierarchical Graph Pooling with Structure Learning (HGP‑SL) model using DGL and PyTorch. It includes custom sparsemax edge attention, weighted graph convolution, hierarchical pooling with learned adjacency, and a full network architecture for graph‑level classification. Supporting utilities handle dataset loading, batching, statistical metrics, and training orchestration. The main script ties everything together, allowing configurable hyper‑parameters, GPU execution, and evaluation on standard graph benchmark datasets.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to reproduce, benchmark, and extend the HGP‑SL graph neural network approach for graph classification tasks, providing a practical example that demonstrates hierarchical pooling, structure learning, and edge‑aware message passing within the DGL ecosystem.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "hierarchical pooling", "structure learning", "sparsemax", "edge attention", "DGL", "PyTorch", "graph classification", "benchmark datasets", "GPU training", "reproducible research"], "summary_hash": "200f82ecc24d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:52:48+00:00"}
