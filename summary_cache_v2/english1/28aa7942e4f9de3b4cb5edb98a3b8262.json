{"summary": "The module implements algorithms that translate CNOT‑dihedral operators into equivalent QuantumCircuit objects. It offers a full‑connectivity routine that selects between a generic multi‑qubit decomposition and a dedicated two‑qubit method, a generic decomposition handling linear, phase, and Pauli parts for any number of qubits, and an exact two‑qubit synthesis using CNOTs and single‑qubit Pauli/phase gates.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient compilation of CNOT‑dihedral gates by providing reusable synthesis utilities that generate hardware‑compatible quantum circuits, supporting both general multi‑qubit scenarios and optimized two‑qubit cases for quantum algorithm implementation.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit synthesis", "CNOT-dihedral decomposition", "multi-qubit algorithm", "two-qubit exact synthesis", "full qubit connectivity", "phase gates", "Pauli gates", "quantum compilation"], "summary_hash": "f137a0af2a08", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:04:32+00:00"}
