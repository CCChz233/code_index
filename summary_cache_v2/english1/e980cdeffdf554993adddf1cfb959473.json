{"summary": "This module provides a PyTorch implementation of the node2vec algorithm for learning low‑dimensional embeddings of nodes in a DGL graph. It handles biased random walks, skip‑gram training with negative sampling, configurable walk and window parameters, and optional sparse embeddings, and includes a model class suitable for downstream graph‑learning tasks.", "business_intent": "Enable the generation of high‑quality node embeddings that can be leveraged in graph‑based machine learning applications such as node classification, link prediction, or clustering within a PyTorch workflow.", "keywords": ["node2vec", "graph embedding", "DGL", "random walk", "skip-gram", "negative sampling", "PyTorch", "sparse embeddings", "node classification", "logistic regression"], "summary_hash": "98fa1939644b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:12:23+00:00"}
