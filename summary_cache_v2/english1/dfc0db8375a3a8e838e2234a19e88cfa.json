{"summary": "The module defines a Pipeline abstraction that groups processing nodes into a directed acyclic graph, offering utilities to inspect inputs, outputs, and dependencies, validate uniqueness constraints, and combine pipelines using set‑like operations. It also provides custom exceptions for cycle detection and duplicate dataset usage.", "business_intent": "To give data engineers a reliable, composable way to declare and execute data transformation workflows, ensuring correct ordering, preventing conflicting dataset definitions, and supporting modular pipeline construction within the Kedro framework.", "keywords": ["pipeline", "directed acyclic graph", "node", "dependency management", "topological sort", "validation", "duplicate outputs", "cycle detection", "composition", "Kedro"], "summary_hash": "74d3c372647b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:17:00+00:00"}
