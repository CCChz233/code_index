{"summary": "The module provides utility functions for training and evaluating simple linear classifiers—primarily logistic regression—on graph embeddings generated by a PyTorch BGRL model. It includes routines for splitting data, performing hyperparameter grid search, and computing classification metrics using scikit‑learn tools.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream performance assessment of graph representation learning models by fitting lightweight classifiers to node embeddings, facilitating quick benchmarking of learned features for tasks such as node classification or protein‑protein interaction prediction.", "keywords": ["logistic regression", "graph embeddings", "downstream evaluation", "train‑test split", "grid search", "scikit-learn", "PyTorch", "BGRL", "linear classifier", "benchmarking"], "summary_hash": "9e2b0ff2b199", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:13:31+00:00"}
