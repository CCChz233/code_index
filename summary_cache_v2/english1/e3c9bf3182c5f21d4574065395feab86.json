{"summary": "The accelerators package defines a unified abstraction layer for hardware back‑ends in Lightning Fabric. It provides an abstract accelerator base, concrete implementations for CPU, NVIDIA CUDA GPUs, Apple Silicon MPS GPUs, and XLA/TPU devices, as well as a registry to discover, register, and manage these accelerator classes. Each implementation handles device discovery, availability checks, parallel device configuration, precision settings, memory handling, and lifecycle setup/teardown.", "business_intent": "Enable Lightning Fabric users to run deep‑learning workloads seamlessly across diverse compute resources—CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, Apple Silicon GPUs, and TPUs—by offering a consistent API for device management, parallel execution, and resource cleanup, thereby simplifying deployment and scaling of models in production and research environments.", "keywords": ["accelerator", "hardware abstraction", "device discovery", "registry", "CPU", "CUDA", "GPU", "MPS", "Apple Silicon", "XLA", "TPU", "Lightning Fabric", "parallel execution", "resource management", "precision", "memory handling"], "summary_hash": "caebbd797ab4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:14:56+00:00"}
