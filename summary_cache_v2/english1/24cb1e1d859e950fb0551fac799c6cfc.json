{"summary": "Implements a diffusion‑based pipeline that converts a single RGB image into a dense depth map. It orchestrates a conditional UNet, a variational auto‑encoder, a scheduler and a CLIP text encoder to encode the input, run denoising steps, decode the latent depth, and optionally post‑process (colorization, resizing, ensembling).", "business_intent": "Enable developers to add accurate monocular depth perception to applications such as augmented reality, robotics navigation, 3D scene reconstruction, and visual effects, without requiring stereo cameras or LiDAR.", "keywords": ["monocular depth estimation", "diffusion pipeline", "UNet", "VAE", "scheduler", "CLIP text encoder", "depth map generation", "image encoding", "depth decoding", "post‑processing", "AR", "robotics", "3D reconstruction"], "summary_hash": "56a5798a6ec5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:29:04+00:00"}
