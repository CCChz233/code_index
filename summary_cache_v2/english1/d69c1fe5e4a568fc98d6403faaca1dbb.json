{"summary": "A collection of Django test cases that exercise many‑to‑many relationships defined with explicit intermediate (through) models. The tests cover serialization of such relations, restrictions on direct creation or assignment, efficient join query trimming, forward and reverse lookups (including custom primary keys), data‑loading sequence creation, and operations on through models that use a custom to_field, checking add, remove, clear and edge cases with null primary keys.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correct implementation of many‑to‑many relationships with explicit through tables in Django projects, ensuring that serialization, query behavior, data loading, and custom field handling work as expected and regressions are caught early.", "keywords": ["Django", "many-to-many", "through model", "serialization", "unit tests", "query optimization", "data loading", "custom primary key", "to_field", "add/remove/clear", "reverse relation"], "summary_hash": "05867f854f86", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:48:51+00:00"}
