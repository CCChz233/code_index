{"summary": "Implements a pipeline that transforms an input image into a new image guided by a textual prompt using the Stable Diffusion latent diffusion model. It encodes the prompt and text into latent space, iteratively denoises with a UNet conditioned on text, applies classifier‑free guidance, decodes the latents back to pixel space, and optionally runs a safety checker. The pipeline also supports loading of additional assets such as textual inversion embeddings, LoRA weights, and IP adapters.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and creators with a ready‑to‑use tool for generating customized visual content from existing images and descriptive text, supporting creative workflows, rapid prototyping, marketing assets, and other content‑creation needs while maintaining safety safeguards.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "image-to-image", "text-guided generation", "latent diffusion", "UNet", "VAE", "CLIP", "classifier-free guidance", "safety checker", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "IP adapter", "scheduler"], "summary_hash": "11bb33cd9087", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:25:29+00:00"}
