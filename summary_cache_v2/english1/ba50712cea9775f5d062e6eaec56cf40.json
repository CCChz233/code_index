{"summary": "A command‑line utility that runs batched, buffered inference with neural RNNT speech‑to‑text models on long audio files. It splits audio into configurable chunks, adds context buffers, decodes each chunk, and merges the partial hypotheses using either a middle‑token or longest‑common‑subsequence algorithm, then writes the final transcriptions (and optional WER) to a file.", "business_intent": "Provide an efficient, scalable solution for transcribing lengthy recordings (e.g., meetings, podcasts) while keeping memory and latency manageable, enabling downstream services such as automated captioning, analytics, and searchable archives.", "keywords": ["RNNT", "buffered inference", "speech-to-text", "chunked processing", "token merging", "LCS algorithm", "audio transcription", "NeMo", "ASR", "batch processing"], "summary_hash": "9f98cbfd15e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:40:28+00:00"}
