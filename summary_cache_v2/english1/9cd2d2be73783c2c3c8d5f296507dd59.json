{"summary": "The ECAPAEncoder class implements a streamlined ECAPA encoder that processes mel‑spectrogram inputs through stacked SE‑TDNN convolutional blocks, omitting the Res2Net component to accelerate training and inference while delivering superior speaker diarization performance. It manages feature dimensions, filter configurations, kernel sizes, dilations, and scaling, and produces encoded representations with corresponding sequence lengths, supporting model export and providing example inputs and type specifications.", "business_intent": "Provide a fast, high‑accuracy front‑end for speaker diarization systems, enabling efficient training and real‑time inference of speaker embeddings for robust diarization pipelines.", "keywords": ["ECAPA encoder", "speaker diarization", "mel spectrogram", "SE‑TDNN", "convolutional neural network", "fast training", "fast inference", "audio processing", "speaker embeddings"], "summary_hash": "716077999b3f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:07:37+00:00"}
