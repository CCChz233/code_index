{"summary": "This module adds Avro file support to Dask's bag collection, offering utilities to read Avro data into a bag and to serialize a bag back to Avro. It handles schema verification, low‑level block parsing, and constructs a HighLevelGraph for parallel, chunk‑based processing using fsspec for abstracted file access.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, distributed processing of Avro datasets within Dask, allowing data engineers to ingest large Avro files as parallel collections and to export processed results back to Avro for downstream big‑data pipelines.", "keywords": ["dask", "bag", "avro", "parallel I/O", "high‑level graph", "fsspec", "schema verification", "distributed processing", "big data"], "summary_hash": "b3c2af35d0eb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:20:15+00:00"}
