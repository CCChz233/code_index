{"summary": "The module implements a cumulative metric class that computes the Panoptic Quality (PQ) for instance segmentation masks, optionally returning its components Segmentation Quality (SQ) and Recognition Quality (RQ). It supports multi‑class handling, configurable reduction across batches, and IoU‑based matching of predicted and ground‑truth instances. The file also contains several auxiliary functions that are currently unused.", "business_intent": "Enable quantitative evaluation of segmentation models by measuring combined detection and segmentation performance, facilitating model comparison and validation in medical imaging workflows.", "keywords": ["panoptic quality", "PQ", "SQ", "RQ", "instance segmentation", "evaluation metric", "IoU matching", "multi‑class", "reduction", "MONAI", "torch"], "summary_hash": "42f8eaf48b1b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:13:27+00:00"}
