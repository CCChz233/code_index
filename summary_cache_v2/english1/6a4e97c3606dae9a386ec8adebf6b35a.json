{"summary": "The module adds accessor classes that extend unstructured grid and data array objects with spatial subsetting methods. Users can extract portions of a grid or its associated data using geometric filters such as bounding boxes, circles, polygons, or nearest‑neighbor point queries, leveraging an internal spatial index for fast cell location.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient extraction of relevant subsets from large unstructured grid datasets, supporting analysis, visualization, and downstream processing by providing convenient, high‑performance spatial selection tools.", "keywords": ["subsetting", "unstructured grid", "spatial filter", "bounding box", "polygon", "nearest neighbor", "data array", "grid accessor", "spatial index", "extraction"], "summary_hash": "60dfa384809e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:30:58+00:00"}
