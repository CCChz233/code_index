{"summary": "This module implements a graph‑based transformer architecture that extends the standard transformer attention mechanism to operate on graph‑structured data. It provides layers that combine node features and edge information through sparse multi‑head attention, a model class that stacks these layers for downstream tasks, and utilities for training and evaluation on benchmark graph property prediction datasets.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and practitioners to apply efficient transformer‑style models to graph learning problems, such as molecular property prediction, by leveraging sparse attention for reduced computational cost and improved scalability.", "keywords": ["graph transformer", "sparse attention", "multi‑head attention", "graph neural network", "DGL", "OGB", "property prediction", "efficient computation", "graph representation learning"], "summary_hash": "ec0955ea8ce4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:09:05+00:00"}
