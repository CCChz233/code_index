{"summary": "This file defines two neural modules that encapsulate a transformer encoder and a transformer decoder for the NeMo NLP framework. Each module handles token and positional embeddings, stacks of self‑attention (and cross‑attention for the decoder), configurable hyper‑parameters such as hidden size, number of layers, and vocabulary size, and provides a forward method along with utilities for model export and example input generation, enabling seamless integration into larger transformer‑based models.", "business_intent": "Provide reusable, exportable components that simplify the construction, training, inference, and deployment of transformer‑based NLP models (e.g., language modeling, translation, summarization) within the NeMo ecosystem.", "keywords": ["transformer", "encoder", "decoder", "NeMo", "NLP", "self‑attention", "cross‑attention", "embeddings", "model export", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "f8778fbdf142", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:08:28+00:00"}
