{"summary": "Provides rotation‑invariant descriptor matching by applying a discrete steerer to rotate feature descriptors. Supports a global mode that selects the rotation yielding the most matches and a local mode that computes per‑pair minimal distances over all discretized rotations. Allows configurable matching strategies (nearest‑neighbor, symmetric NN, mutual NN, symmetric mutual NN) and a quality threshold.", "business_intent": "Deliver robust feature correspondence across rotated images for computer‑vision pipelines such as pose estimation, image stitching, and 3‑D reconstruction.", "keywords": ["rotation invariance", "descriptor matching", "discrete steerer", "global rotation selection", "local distance minimization", "nearest neighbor", "symmetric matching", "mutual nearest neighbor", "thresholding", "computer vision", "feature correspondence"], "summary_hash": "654324799e8a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:41:26+00:00"}
