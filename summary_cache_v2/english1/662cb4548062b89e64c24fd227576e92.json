{"summary": "The script prepares a Stable Diffusion XL text‑to‑image model for efficient inference by performing calibration, applying INT8 quantization, and exporting the quantized model to ONNX/TensorRT formats. It leverages NVIDIA's Ammo quantization utilities and NeMo's diffusion engine and pipeline components to modify the model configuration, generate dummy inputs, and build a TensorRT engine for accelerated deployment.", "business_intent": "To reduce computational cost and latency of Stable Diffusion XL generation, enabling scalable, low‑resource deployment of high‑quality text‑to‑image generation services.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion XL", "text-to-image", "quantization", "INT8", "calibration", "ONNX", "TensorRT", "NVIDIA Ammo", "NeMo", "diffusion engine", "model optimization"], "summary_hash": "03392afeaee1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:37:53+00:00"}
