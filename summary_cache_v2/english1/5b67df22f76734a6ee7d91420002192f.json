{"summary": "This module centralizes optimizer handling for the NeMo framework. It maintains a registry of supported optimizer classes, including standard PyTorch optimizers and custom implementations, and provides a factory mechanism to instantiate an optimizer based on a configuration object. It also offers utilities for registering optimizer parameter schemas and (currently unused) helpers for initializing optimizer state and parsing optimizer arguments. Compatibility with Apex's distributed Adam optimizer is conditionally supported.", "business_intent": "Enable configurable and extensible selection of training optimizers, allowing users to specify optimizer types and hyperparameters via configuration files and obtain ready-to-use optimizer instances for deep learning model training.", "keywords": ["optimizer", "registry", "factory", "configuration", "PyTorch", "NeMo", "Adafactor", "Adan", "Novograd", "Apex", "distributed training"], "summary_hash": "a626f4f94908", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:42:07+00:00"}
