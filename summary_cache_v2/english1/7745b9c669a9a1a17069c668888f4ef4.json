{"summary": "A dataset class that reads a line‑by‑line JSON manifest describing audio file paths, durations, labels, and offsets, and provides filtered, optionally trimmed and normalized audio tensors for training or inference. It supports duration‑based exclusion, silence trimming, fixed‑length window slicing for speaker‑recognition or voice‑activity‑detection (VAD) tasks, configurable window shift for VAD inference, regression or classification label handling, and optional label‑frequency statistics. Helper collate routines package variable‑length sequences or VAD frames into batch tensors.", "business_intent": "Enable rapid development of speech‑related machine‑learning pipelines—such as speech command classification, speaker identification, and VAD—by supplying a ready‑to‑use, configurable audio dataset that integrates with training frameworks and handles common preprocessing steps.", "keywords": ["audio dataset", "manifest json", "duration filtering", "silence trimming", "audio normalization", "window slicing", "voice activity detection", "speaker recognition", "regression task", "label occurrence", "collate function", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "2901fbb531e8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:17:29+00:00"}
