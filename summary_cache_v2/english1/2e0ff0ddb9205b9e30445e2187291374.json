{"summary": "The package contains tools for preparing supervised training data from raw audio and for performing voice conversion using self‑supervised speech representations. One utility converts waveforms into mel‑spectrograms, extracts pitch, validates and segments the signals, and stores the features and metadata for SSL‑based TTS model training. The other utility extracts SSL features, pitch, and speaker embeddings from an input utterance and synthesizes a converted voice using NeMo SSL‑TTS and HiFiGAN decoders.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient creation of high‑quality training datasets and provide a ready‑to‑use voice conversion pipeline for commercial text‑to‑speech and voice cloning applications.", "keywords": ["audio preprocessing", "mel spectrogram", "pitch extraction", "self‑supervised learning", "text‑to‑speech", "voice conversion", "NeMo", "HiFiGAN", "dataset generation", "speaker embedding"], "summary_hash": "d8a49c1f1c37", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:13:15+00:00"}
