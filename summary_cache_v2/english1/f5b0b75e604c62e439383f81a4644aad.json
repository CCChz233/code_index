{"summary": "This module implements internal data‑fetching utilities for Lightning training loops. It defines iterator classes that handle combined data loaders, wrap fetchers to expose a standard iterator interface, provide raw dataloader iterators for custom pre‑fetching or manual device placement, and manage prefetch buffers with unknown dataset lengths. The utilities also include lifecycle hooks for setup, reset, and teardown, and raise configuration errors when misuse is detected.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible, efficient, and configurable data loading strategies within Lightning's PyTorch training workflows, supporting combined loaders, custom prefetching, and manual batch handling while ensuring proper resource management.", "keywords": ["data fetching", "iterator", "prefetch", "combined loader", "Lightning", "PyTorch", "training loop", "data loader iterator", "resource management", "misconfiguration handling"], "summary_hash": "e0a588d1051f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:58:42+00:00"}
