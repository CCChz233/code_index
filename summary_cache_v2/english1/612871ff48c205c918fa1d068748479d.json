{"summary": "The module offers utilities to assess whether a numeric value or a parameter expression corresponds to a rational multiple of π. It employs pre‑computed fraction and power meshes together with a normalization helper to perform the check efficiently.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum circuit tools to recognize and simplify angles that are rational multiples of π, facilitating gate simplification, circuit optimization, and accurate parameter handling in quantum algorithms.", "keywords": ["π multiple detection", "rational fraction", "angle normalization", "parameter expression", "quantum circuit", "gate simplification", "precomputed mesh", "numeric check"], "summary_hash": "bd3ff95ddee8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:06:54+00:00"}
