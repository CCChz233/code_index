{"summary": "The module provides utilities for summarizing model weights and architecture in PyTorch Lightning. It includes a LayerSummary class that captures key characteristics of a single neural network layer, such as class name, total trainable parameters, and input/output tensor dimensions during the first forward pass. The ModelSummary class generates a textual summary table of layers in a LightningModule, showing name, type, param count, mode, input/output shapes, etc. It can limit depth, uses example_input_array to run forward pass to capture shapes, handles tensors and nested structures, and shows unknown shapes as ?. It also aggregates parameter counts, training/eval mode counts, and model size.", "business_intent": "The utilities aim to help developers understand model architecture, parameter distribution, memory footprint, and debugging, facilitating documentation and reporting.", "keywords": ["model", "summary", "weights", "layer", "architecture", "parameter", "debugging"], "summary_hash": "8a5ef880f241", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:01:07+00:00"}
