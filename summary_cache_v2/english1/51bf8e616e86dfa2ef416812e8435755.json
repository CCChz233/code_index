{"summary": "This module contains automated test suites for the Allegro diffusion pipeline, covering both fast unit tests with mock components and full integration tests with real models. The tests verify core behaviors such as attention slicing, callback execution, inference outputs, model saving/loading, and VAE tiling, ensuring deterministic results and proper resource handling.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness, stability, and performance of the Allegro text-to-image generation pipeline to guarantee reliable deployment in production environments.", "keywords": ["Allegro pipeline", "unit testing", "integration testing", "diffusion model", "attention slicing", "callback handling", "model serialization", "VAE tiling", "deterministic inference", "GPU testing", "text-to-image"], "summary_hash": "38e393438fa0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:54:00+00:00"}
