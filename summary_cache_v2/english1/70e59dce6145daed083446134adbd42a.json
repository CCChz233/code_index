{"summary": "This module integrates a Triton inference server into the Litellm framework, providing functionality to request text completions and vector embeddings. It manages both synchronous and asynchronous HTTP interactions, supports streaming responses, processes embedding tensors, and defines a custom error type for consistent exception handling.", "business_intent": "Allow applications to leverage Triton as a scalable backend for large language model generation and embedding services, simplifying integration and improving performance for developers using the Litellm ecosystem.", "keywords": ["Triton", "inference server", "LLM integration", "text completion", "embeddings", "streaming", "asynchronous", "HTTP client", "error handling", "litellm"], "summary_hash": "f2fef7ffa8d2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:44:43+00:00"}
