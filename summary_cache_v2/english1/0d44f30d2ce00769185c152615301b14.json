{"summary": "The module defines unit tests that verify the correctness of distributed regression metric handlers (mean absolute error, mean squared error, peak signal‑to‑noise ratio, root mean squared error) in the MONAI framework. It creates synthetic tensors, runs them through Ignite engines across simulated distributed ranks, aggregates partial results, and compares the outcomes with NumPy reference implementations using helper utilities.", "business_intent": "Ensure that evaluation metrics for regression tasks operate reliably in multi‑node or distributed training environments, providing trustworthy performance measurements for medical imaging models deployed in production pipelines.", "keywords": ["distributed computing", "regression metrics", "mean absolute error", "mean squared error", "peak signal-to-noise ratio", "root mean squared error", "MONAI", "Ignite", "unit testing", "PyTorch", "deterministic behavior", "validation"], "summary_hash": "8cc5e5fc6957", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:39:01+00:00"}
