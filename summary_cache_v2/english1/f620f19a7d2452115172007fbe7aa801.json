{"summary": "Provides a suite of dictionary‑compatible wrappers that adapt MONAI’s core post‑processing transforms (e.g., activations, discretization, distance mapping, ensemble methods, label manipulation, and morphological operations) so they can be applied directly to entries within a data mapping, preserving metadata and handling missing keys gracefully.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless integration of a wide range of post‑processing steps into medical imaging pipelines that operate on dictionary‑structured data, simplifying the handling of model outputs and downstream analysis without requiring manual extraction or re‑packing of tensors.", "keywords": ["dictionary-based transforms", "post‑processing", "model output handling", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "metadata preservation", "activation functions", "distance transform", "ensemble aggregation", "label manipulation", "morphological operations"], "summary_hash": "dc1f27c9df8f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:23:16+00:00"}
