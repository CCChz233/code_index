{"summary": "The module implements a tree‑matching engine that uses a Lark grammar to verify and locate sub‑structures within parse trees. It includes a lightweight lexer for processing child nodes, a matcher builder that creates callable predicates for specific patterns, and assorted helpers for rule handling and terminal filtering.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable component for analyzing and transforming parse trees in language‑processing applications, enabling validation, pattern extraction, and reconstruction based on a defined grammar.", "keywords": ["tree matching", "Lark grammar", "parse tree", "pattern matcher", "lexer", "rule processing", "syntax validation", "AST transformation", "grammar reconstruction"], "summary_hash": "a80985f9ce7d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:41:52+00:00"}
