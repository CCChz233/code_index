{"summary": "This test module validates the behavior of MONAI dataset classes, focusing on lazy loading mechanisms, shape and dimensionality checks, and proper logging integration. It includes helper utilities for verifying dataset outputs and a suite of parameterized tests covering standard and tuple-based datasets.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that dataset components reliably handle deferred data loading and maintain correct output shapes, thereby supporting robust medical imaging pipelines and preventing runtime errors in downstream processing.", "keywords": ["dataset", "lazy loading", "shape verification", "tuple dataset", "logging", "unit testing", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "transforms", "parameterized tests"], "summary_hash": "6b0b4900f3cb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:32:16+00:00"}
