{"summary": "Implements a transpiler transformation that examines a circuit's DAG, finds measurement and barrier operations that occur solely at the end of the circuit, removes those trailing operations, and then deletes any classical registers or bits that become unused as a result.", "business_intent": "Helps clean up quantum circuits before they are sent to hardware or further optimization passes by stripping unnecessary final measurements and barriers, reducing circuit size and depth, and ensuring compatibility with backends that do not require explicit final measurements.", "keywords": ["transpiler pass", "circuit optimization", "final measurement removal", "barrier removal", "DAG manipulation", "unused classical register pruning", "quantum circuit cleanup"], "summary_hash": "4242a175a321", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:26:27+00:00"}
