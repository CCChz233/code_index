{"summary": "A configuration container for the GLPN model that encapsulates all architectural hyper‑parameters such as input channels, encoder block counts, depths, patch sizes, attention heads, dropout rates, initializer settings, and decoder dimensions. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate a GLPN model with a specific structure.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to easily define, customize, and reproduce the exact architecture and training settings of a GLPN model without hard‑coding values, facilitating model creation, fine‑tuning, and deployment.", "keywords": ["GLPN", "model configuration", "encoder blocks", "transformer", "attention heads", "dropout", "initializer", "decoder size", "pretrained config", "hyperparameters"], "summary_hash": "02395fb0a521", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:13:54+00:00"}
