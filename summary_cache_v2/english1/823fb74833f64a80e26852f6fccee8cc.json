{"summary": "Implements a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) scheduler that governs the diffusion timeline, computes cumulative scaling factors, injects noise into latent representations, adjusts model inputs according to the current step, and advances the diffusion state during sampling or training. It leverages mixins for configuration management and model persistence.", "business_intent": "Provides a configurable and reusable diffusion scheduling component for generative AI pipelines, enabling efficient and controllable image synthesis using DDPM techniques.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "denoising", "timesteps", "noise injection", "latent scaling", "generative model", "DDPM", "Wuerstchen", "stepwise sampling"], "summary_hash": "37d47151f8b4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:56:33+00:00"}
