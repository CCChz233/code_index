{"summary": "The component enriches input data with randomly selected guidance cues derived from discrepancy maps that highlight differences between ground‑truth labels and model predictions. It extracts relevant guidance vectors, optionally randomizes their selection based on a probability factor, and integrates them into the data pipeline for downstream processing.", "business_intent": "To boost model performance and robustness by supplying supplemental, stochastic guidance that targets prediction errors, supporting strategies such as active learning, error‑focused training, or interactive refinement.", "keywords": ["guidance augmentation", "discrepancy analysis", "random selection", "probability weighting", "label‑prediction mismatch", "machine learning preprocessing", "training enhancement"], "summary_hash": "45fce0083d74", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:13:19+00:00"}
