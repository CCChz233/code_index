{"summary": "The benchmark package provides a framework for defining, executing, and reporting performance evaluations of machine learning models. It includes a core orchestrator that runs benchmarks based on configurable parameters, utilities for generating consistent output identifiers and interacting with the Hugging Face Hub, and data structures for collecting and aggregating metrics such as latency, throughput, memory usage, and energy efficiency, ultimately producing structured reports that can be logged or uploaded.", "business_intent": "To give developers and researchers a reproducible, extensible tool for measuring and comparing model performance across different hardware and software setups, and to facilitate sharing of benchmark results with the community via model hubs.", "keywords": ["benchmark", "performance evaluation", "configuration", "reporting", "latency", "throughput", "memory usage", "energy consumption", "efficiency", "Hugging Face Hub", "model metrics", "aggregation"], "summary_hash": "7542dbb0d93d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:32:33+00:00"}
