{"summary": "Defines a unified interface that encapsulates the current state of a sequence decoder—typically the hidden vectors—but also supports alternative representations such as input‑feeding vectors or stateless decoders. The interface supplies utilities for updating the state across beam candidates, detaching it from the autograd graph, and applying batch‑wise transformations, allowing downstream modules to handle decoder state uniformly during generation.", "business_intent": "Standardize how models store and manipulate decoder states so that beam‑search decoding and other generation strategies can be applied consistently across different decoder architectures.", "keywords": ["decoder state", "hidden vectors", "beam search", "input feeding", "non‑recurrent decoder", "state management", "detach", "batch mapping", "generation"], "summary_hash": "3b1bf81a6393", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:08:30+00:00"}
