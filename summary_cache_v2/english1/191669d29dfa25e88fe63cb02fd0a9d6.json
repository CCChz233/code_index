{"summary": "A pipeline that orchestrates unconditional or class‑conditional image synthesis using a UNet denoiser and a consistency‑model scheduler. It validates inputs, prepares latent tensors and optional class labels, runs the iterative denoising process, and converts the resulting latents into final images.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑level, easy‑to‑use interface for generating images with consistency models, supporting creative, marketing, and prototyping workflows that require fast, high‑quality visual content.", "keywords": ["image generation", "consistency model", "diffusion pipeline", "UNet denoiser", "scheduler", "latent preparation", "class‑conditional synthesis", "post‑processing"], "summary_hash": "b708ea0aa3a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:14:57+00:00"}
