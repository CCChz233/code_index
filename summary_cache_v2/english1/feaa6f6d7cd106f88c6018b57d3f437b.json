{"summary": "A configuration container for the OPT transformer model that stores all architectural and training hyperparameters—vocabulary size, hidden dimension, number of decoder layers, feed‑forward size, attention heads, activation function, maximum position embeddings, dropout rates, layer‑norm options, cache usage, bias settings, and initialization scale. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration and is used to instantiate an OPT model with the specified setup.", "business_intent": "Provide a structured way for developers to define, customize, and reproduce the architecture and behavior of an OPT language model, enabling easy model creation, fine‑tuning, and consistent configuration management.", "keywords": ["OPT", "configuration", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "decoder layers", "attention heads", "dropout", "layer norm", "cache", "bias", "pretrained config", "model initialization"], "summary_hash": "91347ab05e9c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:06:44+00:00"}
