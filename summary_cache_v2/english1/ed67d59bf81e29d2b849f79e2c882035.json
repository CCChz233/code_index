{"summary": "The script demonstrates how to perform schedule‑free training for a text classification task using the Accelerate library. It loads a dataset, tokenizes the text, creates data loaders, defines a training loop that leverages schedule‑free optimization, and evaluates the model with the Hugging Face Transformers and Evaluate libraries.", "business_intent": "Provide a concise, ready‑to‑run example that helps developers adopt schedule‑free distributed training for NLP classification models, reducing the need for manual gradient accumulation and improving training efficiency.", "keywords": ["accelerate", "schedule-free", "distributed training", "PyTorch", "transformers", "tokenization", "dataset", "dataloader", "sequence classification", "NLP", "evaluation"], "summary_hash": "b4ea245382fd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:16:33+00:00"}
