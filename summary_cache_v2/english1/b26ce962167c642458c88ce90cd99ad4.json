{"summary": "This module implements the conversion layer between generic OpenAI‑style embedding requests/responses and the specific request and response schema required by the Amazon Titan G1 model on AWS Bedrock. It encapsulates configuration handling, maps input parameters to the Bedrock format, and translates the model's output back into a unified embedding response structure.", "business_intent": "Allow applications that use OpenAI‑compatible embedding APIs to seamlessly leverage the Amazon Titan G1 embedding model on Bedrock without dealing with format incompatibilities, simplifying integration and reducing development overhead.", "keywords": ["embedding transformation", "OpenAI format", "Amazon Titan G1", "AWS Bedrock", "request mapping", "response conversion", "parameter translation", "API integration"], "summary_hash": "a9be7f0d0170", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:00:23+00:00"}
