{"summary": "The script orchestrates an end‑to‑end training pipeline for an unsupervised GraphSAGE model using PyTorch Lightning. It defines a data module that loads graph datasets, prepares training and validation loaders with negative sampling, configures a Lightning module that implements the model, loss computation, optimizer, and validation logic, and runs the training loop with checkpointing and callbacks.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run example that demonstrates how to train graph neural networks in an unsupervised fashion at scale, enabling practitioners to quickly apply GraphSAGE to large graph datasets for downstream node classification or representation learning tasks.", "keywords": ["GraphSAGE", "unsupervised learning", "PyTorch Lightning", "negative sampling", "node classification", "DGL", "graph neural network", "data module", "training pipeline", "cross‑entropy loss", "OGB", "Reddit"], "summary_hash": "a3afc507f3f9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:32:55+00:00"}
