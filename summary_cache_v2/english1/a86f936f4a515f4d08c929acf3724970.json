{"summary": "The package provides a unified, type‑safe abstraction layer for interacting with a wide range of large language‑model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Gemini, Mistral, Vertex AI, etc.). It includes synchronous and asynchronous client wrappers, request templating, hook mechanisms, retry and re‑ask logic, function/tool schema conversion, multimodal content handling, and utilities that parse raw model responses into Pydantic models with validation and token‑usage tracking.", "business_intent": "To streamline and standardize LLM integration for developers, delivering structured, validated outputs with minimal boilerplate while supporting multiple providers, retries, multimodal data, and extensible processing pipelines.", "keywords": ["LLM integration", "client abstraction", "synchronous", "asynchronous", "function calling", "tool schema", "retry", "re‑ask", "hooks", "templating", "multimodal", "Pydantic validation", "token usage", "type‑safe responses"], "summary_hash": "75570a415e7d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:41:29+00:00"}
