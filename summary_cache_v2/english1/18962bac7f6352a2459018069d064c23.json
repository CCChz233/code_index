{"summary": "This module implements GPU‑accelerated Fast Fourier Transform utilities that emulate the SciPy fftpack interface using CuPy and cuFFT. It provides thin wrappers for one‑, two‑ and N‑dimensional forward and inverse transforms, including real‑valued variants, handling data type conversion, output sizing, and FFT plan management.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to perform high‑performance Fourier analysis on CUDA‑enabled hardware through a familiar SciPy‑like API, simplifying integration of GPU‑based signal processing into scientific Python workflows.", "keywords": ["fast Fourier transform", "gpu acceleration", "cupy", "cufft", "scipy compatibility", "multidimensional transform", "fft plan management", "signal processing"], "summary_hash": "8be1821f89d2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:33:29+00:00"}
