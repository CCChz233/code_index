{"summary": "A collection of unit tests for the plasma source components of the library, covering the OpenPMD HDF5 data reader, three‑dimensional plasma source initialization, and the plasma blob model. The tests verify that physical quantities such as charge density, fields, and currents are correctly loaded with proper shapes and units, that derived properties and regime classifications are computed accurately, and that error handling works for invalid inputs.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and scientific accuracy of plasma source data ingestion and modeling features, supporting downstream plasma physics simulations and analyses.", "keywords": ["plasma source", "unit testing", "OpenPMD", "HDF5", "charge density", "electric field", "magnetic field", "current", "3D plasma", "plasma blob", "coupling strength", "quantum theta", "ionization", "regime classification", "magnetostatic integration", "derived properties"], "summary_hash": "c110307ee731", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:15:26+00:00"}
