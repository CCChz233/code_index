{"summary": "This test module defines scenario data and helper utilities for evaluating how unstructured MODFLOW‑6 simulations are partitioned. It includes predefined configurations for horizontal flow barriers, array partitioning patterns, and well setups, and provides a suite of test functions that exercise transport, multispecies transport, inactive cells, and well handling across model partitions.", "business_intent": "Validate and ensure the correctness of the partitioning logic in the IMOD groundwater modeling framework for complex unstructured MODFLOW‑6 models, thereby supporting reliable simulation of flow barriers, wells, and transport processes in real‑world hydrogeologic applications.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW 6", "unstructured grid", "partitioning", "horizontal flow barrier", "well", "transport", "testing", "groundwater modeling", "simulation", "array partition"], "summary_hash": "c7e8b3ceee6a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:00:21+00:00"}
