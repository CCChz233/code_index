{"summary": "Implements a patch merging layer for Swin Transformer models. The layer receives a feature map with a specified spatial resolution and channel depth, optionally pads it to ensure even dimensions, groups neighboring patches, normalizes the concatenated features, and projects them to a higher-dimensional space, thereby halving the height and width while increasing the channel dimension.", "business_intent": "Offer an efficient, learnable down‑sampling component for vision transformer architectures to build hierarchical representations and reduce computational load in image analysis applications.", "keywords": ["patch merging", "Swin Transformer", "downsampling", "layer normalization", "feature map", "spatial resolution", "channel expansion", "computer vision", "hierarchical representation"], "summary_hash": "8c887ce73ffd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:32:21+00:00"}
