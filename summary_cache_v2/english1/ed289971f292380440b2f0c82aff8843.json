{"summary": "The module implements a simple numerical routine that estimates the value of π by summing a series of reciprocal squares, along with a small helper for computing 1/n². It serves as a concise example used in a profiling tutorial.", "business_intent": "To illustrate performance measurement and optimization techniques (e.g., using Cython) in an educational setting, showing how a basic mathematical computation can be profiled and accelerated.", "keywords": ["π approximation", "reciprocal square series", "performance profiling", "Cython tutorial", "numerical computation", "educational example", "optimization"], "summary_hash": "aca31093b7b6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:19:34+00:00"}
