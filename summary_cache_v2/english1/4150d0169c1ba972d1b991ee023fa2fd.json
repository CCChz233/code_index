{"summary": "This module implements a set of string‑derived classes that encapsulate raw MAPDL command output and provide convenient parsing methods to convert the text into native Python data structures such as lists, NumPy arrays, or Pandas DataFrames. It also defines a Commands wrapper that builds, manages, and dispatches MAPDL command strings to the MAPDL engine, along with helper utilities for docstring manipulation and text indentation.", "business_intent": "To streamline interaction with ANSYS Mechanical APDL by offering a high‑level Python interface that constructs MAPDL commands, sends them to the solver, and translates the textual results into easily consumable Python objects for further analysis or automation.", "keywords": ["ANSYS", "MAPDL", "command wrapper", "output parsing", "string subclass", "boundary conditions", "component listing", "NumPy", "pandas", "docstring injection", "utility functions"], "summary_hash": "6c284e187c15", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:57:57+00:00"}
