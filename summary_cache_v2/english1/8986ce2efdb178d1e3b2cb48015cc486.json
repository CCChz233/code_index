{"summary": "This module configures the pytest environment for Lightning Fabric's test suite. It supplies fixtures and utility helpers that mock hardware accelerator availability, reset deterministic settings, manage distributed process groups, and clean up temporary artifacts, ensuring each test runs in a controlled and isolated context.", "business_intent": "Establish a robust testing framework for the Lightning Fabric library that can simulate various accelerator backends and distributed configurations while guaranteeing reproducibility and proper resource cleanup.", "keywords": ["pytest", "fixtures", "Lightning Fabric", "accelerator mocking", "TPU", "XLA", "distributed training", "process group teardown", "environment reset", "deterministic behavior", "logging capture"], "summary_hash": "677267502854", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:32:46+00:00"}
