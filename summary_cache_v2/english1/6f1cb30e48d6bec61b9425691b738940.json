{"summary": "The module provides a set of adapters that convert generic DGL datasets into specialized formats for graph‑level, link‑level, and node‑level prediction tasks. Each adapter handles indexing, length queries, automatic creation and caching of train/validation/test splits, and exposes relevant metadata such as number of tasks, classes, and feature dimensions. It also includes utilities for generating negative samples needed in link prediction.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to quickly repurpose existing graph datasets for different machine‑learning objectives without manual preprocessing, thereby accelerating the development and evaluation of graph neural network models.", "keywords": ["dataset adapter", "graph neural network", "DGL", "graph property prediction", "link prediction", "node prediction", "data splitting", "caching", "metadata extraction", "negative sampling", "heterogeneous graphs"], "summary_hash": "94fa2991e675", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:40:44+00:00"}
