{"summary": "This example implements the GraphSAINT framework for training graph convolutional networks on large-scale graph datasets. It includes a GCN model, various subgraph samplers (node, edge, random-walk) compatible with DGL's SAINTSampler, a training script that orchestrates data loading, sampling, model optimization, and evaluation, and utility functions for logging, metric computation, and data preprocessing.", "business_intent": "Provide a reference implementation that demonstrates how to apply GraphSAINT sampling for efficient, inductive training of GNNs, enabling researchers and developers to benchmark, reproduce, and extend graph learning methods on real-world datasets.", "keywords": ["GraphSAINT", "graph sampling", "graph convolutional network", "GNN", "DGL", "PyTorch", "inductive learning", "subgraph mini-batch", "node classification", "large-scale graphs"], "summary_hash": "1ddec53e15f6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:55:15+00:00"}
