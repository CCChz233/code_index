{"summary": "The module orchestrates the end‑to‑end training pipeline for a Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion (GCMC) model on the MovieLens dataset using PyTorch. It loads the full interaction graph onto the selected device, builds the GCMC architecture with decoder layers, configures the optimizer and activation functions, runs the training loop with periodic evaluation, logs metrics, and saves model checkpoints.", "business_intent": "To develop and train a graph‑based recommendation system that predicts user ratings for movies, enabling improved personalized recommendations in a collaborative‑filtering scenario.", "keywords": ["GCMC", "Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion", "MovieLens", "PyTorch", "training pipeline", "recommendation system", "collaborative filtering", "neural network", "optimizer", "evaluation", "logging", "checkpoint"], "summary_hash": "2a5119722143", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:19:11+00:00"}
