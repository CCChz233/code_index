{"summary": "A set of neural modules that prepare and transform video data for multimodal speech‑visual systems. They include front‑ends that convert raw frames into compact embeddings using either a simple linear projection or a configurable ResNet backbone, utilities for normalizing, resizing, and permuting video tensors, and augmentation tools that apply spatial and temporal masking to simulate realistic variations.", "business_intent": "Enable robust lip‑reading and speech‑visual models by providing ready‑to‑use video preprocessing, feature extraction, and augmentation components that can be integrated into end‑to‑end training pipelines.", "keywords": ["video preprocessing", "feature extraction", "linear projection", "ResNet backbone", "spatial masking", "temporal masking", "multimodal speech", "lip reading", "neural augmentation", "tensor normalization"], "summary_hash": "44875739f1af", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:02:37+00:00"}
