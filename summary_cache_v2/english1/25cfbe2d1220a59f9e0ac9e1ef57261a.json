{"summary": "Implements the RetinaNet detection architecture, processing 2‑D or 3‑D image tensors through a configurable feature extractor to generate multi‑scale feature maps, and outputs per‑anchor classification scores and bounding‑box regression tensors for each pyramid level. Allows customization of class count, anchor count, input size constraints, and output format (dictionary or flat list).", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, ready‑to‑use RetinaNet object‑detection model for medical imaging applications, enabling easy integration of multi‑scale detection capabilities into 2‑D and 3‑D pipelines.", "keywords": ["RetinaNet", "object detection", "feature pyramid network", "classification head", "regression head", "2D", "3D", "medical imaging", "deep learning", "anchor boxes"], "summary_hash": "ae301d01a007", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:26:29+00:00"}
