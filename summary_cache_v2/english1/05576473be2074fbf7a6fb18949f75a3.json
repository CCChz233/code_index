{"summary": "The module aggregates and re‑exports core building blocks for constructing transformer components, such as activation layers, attention mechanisms, input projections, multi‑head dispatch strategies, patch embeddings, and residual connections. It also provides a helper to instantiate a multi‑head attention component based on configuration.", "business_intent": "To simplify the assembly of customizable transformer architectures, enabling developers and researchers to plug‑and‑play different components for rapid prototyping, experimentation, and production deployment of advanced neural network models.", "keywords": ["transformer", "attention", "multi-head", "activation", "residual", "patch embedding", "input projection", "component factory", "modular architecture", "xformers"], "summary_hash": "cb0e10a54fc8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:28:54+00:00"}
