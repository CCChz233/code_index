{"summary": "The script orchestrates an end‑to‑end workflow for training and evaluating a hierarchical graph pooling self‑supervised model on graph benchmark datasets using PyTorch and DGL. It handles command‑line option parsing, dataset loading, data loader creation, model instantiation, training loop with loss computation and optimizer updates, periodic validation/testing, metric logging, and checkpoint saving.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run example that enables researchers and developers to experiment with hierarchical graph pooling self‑supervised learning on standard graph datasets, supporting reproducible experiments and performance benchmarking.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "DGL", "graph neural networks", "hierarchical graph pooling", "self-supervised learning", "training loop", "evaluation", "command-line interface", "graph dataset", "benchmark"], "summary_hash": "0127eac7549c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:16:44+00:00"}
