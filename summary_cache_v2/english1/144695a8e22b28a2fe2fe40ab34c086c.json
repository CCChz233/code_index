{"summary": "Implements a custom diffusion pipeline that generates new variations of an input image (optionally guided by text) by encoding the image with CLIP models, projecting the embeddings, and decoding them through a conditional UNet followed by multi‑stage super‑resolution, all coordinated by specialized schedulers. Includes a helper for spherical linear interpolation of latent vectors.", "business_intent": "Demonstrates how to leverage UnCLIP technology for creative image editing and content generation, enabling developers to build AI‑powered tools for image variation, design iteration, and visual content creation.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "image variation", "CLIP encoding", "UNet decoding", "super‑resolution", "spherical interpolation", "latent space", "generative AI", "content creation", "AI‑driven design"], "summary_hash": "8a654139bb5c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:04:06+00:00"}
