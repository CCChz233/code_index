{"summary": "Implements a high‑level trainer that orchestrates the full lifecycle of fine‑tuning a language model using a reinforcement‑learning‑style loop. It loads datasets, runs iterative training steps, generates model outputs for reward evaluation, updates the model, and finally produces a model card describing the trained model.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to efficiently apply reinforcement‑learning‑based optimization to language models, automating data handling, training cycles, reward‑driven updates, and documentation generation for production‑ready models.", "keywords": ["language model fine‑tuning", "reinforcement learning", "RLOO", "data loading", "iterative training", "output generation", "reward evaluation", "model documentation", "accelerate", "transformers"], "summary_hash": "939a5a79597d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:59:19+00:00"}
