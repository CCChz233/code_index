{"summary": "The class models a linear reversible quantum circuit on a configurable number of qubits by storing its action as a binary n × n matrix. It maintains the matrix in the big‑endian ordering required by the underlying synthesis routine and offers utilities to convert between circuit, Clifford, and permutation representations. Its core capability is to synthesize the stored linear function into a sequence of CNOT and SWAP gates using the Patel‑Markov‑Hayes optimal algorithm.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to represent, validate, and efficiently compile linear reversible quantum operations into hardware‑compatible gate sets, facilitating circuit optimization and integration within quantum software stacks.", "keywords": ["linear reversible circuit", "quantum matrix representation", "binary matrix", "CNOT synthesis", "SWAP gates", "Patel‑Markov‑Hayes algorithm", "gate-level compilation", "Qiskit integration", "reversible function"], "summary_hash": "141278b30fec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:35:45+00:00"}
