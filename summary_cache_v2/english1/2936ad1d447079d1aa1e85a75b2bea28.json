{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class FastPath: micro-optimized class for searching a path for children. Methods: children, joinpath, lookup, mtime, search, zip_children. So class responsibility: provide fast path manipulation and retrieval of child entries, joining paths, looking up entries, getting modification times, searching, zipping children. Business intent: improve performance for filesystem-like path operations, used in applications needing rapid traversal of hierarchical data (e.g., file system, virtual file system, content management). Keywords: path, children, fast, lookup, search, join, modification time, zip, optimization, traversal.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed to ensure no method names verbatim? The constraint: \"Do NOT list method names verbatim.\" That means we shouldn't include method names in summary or business_intent? Probably avoid listing them directly. Use generic terms.\n\nLet's craft summary: \"Provides a lightweight, high‑performance interface for navigating and querying hierarchical paths, exposing utilities to retrieve child elements, combine segments, locate entries, obtain timestamps, perform searches and pair child collections.\"\n\nBusiness intent: \"Accelerate path‑based operations in systems such as file managers, content repositories, or any application that frequently traverses directory‑like structures, reducing overhead compared to standard libraries.\"\n\nKeywords list: [\"path traversal\", \"fast lookup\", \"child enumeration\", \"join segments\", \"modification time\", \"search optimization\", \"zip children\", \"performance\"].\n\nMake sure not to include method names verbatim: \"children\", \"joinpath\", etc appear in keywords maybe okay? The constraint says do NOT list method names verbatim. So we should avoid using exact method names. Use synonyms. So avoid \"children\", \"joinpath\", \"lookup\", \"mtime\", \"search\", \"zip_children\". Use \"child enumeration\", \"path joining\", \"entry lookup\", \"modification timestamp\", \"search operation\", \"pairing child collections\". In keywords we can use similar but not exact method names. So avoid \"children\". Use \"child enumeration\". Avoid \"joinpath\". Use \"path concatenation\". Avoid \"lookup\". Use \"entry resolution\". Avoid \"mtime\". Use \"mod time\". Avoid \"search\". Use \"searching\". Avoid \"zip_children\". Use \"zipping children\". Might still be considered verbatim? \"zipping children\" includes \"children\". Might be okay. But to be safe, maybe \"pairing child lists\". Let's craft keywords accordingly.\n\nKeywords: [\"", "business_intent": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class FastPath: micro-optimized class for searching a path for children.
