{"summary": "Implements a two-qubit parameterized XX+YY interaction gate (also known as an XY gate) that performs a coherent rotation by angle theta between the |01> and |10> states, with an optional phase beta applied to the first qubit. Provides the unitary matrix and circuit symbol for integration into quantum circuits.", "business_intent": "Enables quantum programmers to add an entangling XX+YY rotation to circuits, facilitating universal gate sets, simulation of spin-exchange Hamiltonians, and algorithms requiring iSWAP-like behavior or controlled swapping.", "keywords": ["quantum gate", "two-qubit", "XX+YY interaction", "XY gate", "parameterized rotation", "phase beta", "entanglement", "Qiskit", "unitary matrix", "spin exchange"], "summary_hash": "e21443dd8302", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:12:17+00:00"}
