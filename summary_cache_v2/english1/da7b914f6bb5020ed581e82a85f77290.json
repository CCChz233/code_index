{"summary": "This module defines a complete latent diffusion pipeline for converting textual descriptions into images. It includes a BERT‑style transformer encoder for processing prompts, a UNet denoiser conditioned on the encoded text, various diffusion schedulers for iterative refinement, and a VAE decoder to reconstruct pixel images from latent representations. Supporting classes implement the attention, configuration, and encoder layers required by the text model.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to integrate state‑of‑the‑art text‑to‑image generation into applications, providing a high‑level API that handles prompt encoding, diffusion sampling, and image decoding without requiring low‑level model management.", "keywords": ["latent diffusion", "text-to-image generation", "BERT encoder", "UNet denoiser", "diffusion scheduler", "VAE decoder", "transformer attention", "AI image synthesis", "pipeline abstraction"], "summary_hash": "797160cc678d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:20:00+00:00"}
