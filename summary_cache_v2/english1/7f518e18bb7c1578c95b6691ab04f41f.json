{"summary": "The script demonstrates how to perform inference with a Duplex Text Normalization system that combines a trained tagger and decoder model. It supports two usage modes: batch processing of a raw text file (producing normalized and denormalized output files) and interactive, one‑query‑at‑a‑time inference. Configuration is handled via a default YAML file or a user‑specified config, and the required pretrained models are supplied via command‑line arguments.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to apply pre‑trained text normalization models for converting spoken‑style text to written form (and vice versa) across multiple languages, facilitating downstream tasks such as speech synthesis, automatic speech recognition post‑processing, and language data preparation.", "keywords": ["inference", "text normalization", "Duplex model", "tagger", "decoder", "batch processing", "interactive mode", "NeMo", "pretrained models", "multilingual"], "summary_hash": "a893dc3300e7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:41:43+00:00"}
