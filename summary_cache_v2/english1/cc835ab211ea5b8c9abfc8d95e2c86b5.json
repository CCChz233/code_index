{"summary": "The parity_pytorch package contains utilities and test suites that verify numerical consistency and performance of PyTorch Lightning models across different training configurations. It includes helpers for conditional test execution, timing and memory measurement, a LightningModule for CIFAR training, a script to run multiple training scenarios and generate comparison plots, and tests that compare basic model implementations and synchronized batch‑norm behavior between single‑process and distributed runs.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that various PyTorch Lightning model implementations behave identically and meet performance expectations regardless of execution mode, thereby increasing reliability of the library for production and research deployments.", "keywords": ["PyTorch Lightning", "parity testing", "model consistency", "benchmarking", "performance measurement", "synchronized batch normalization", "distributed training", "CIFAR", "MNIST", "RNN", "pytest utilities"], "summary_hash": "8efd601402a6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:08:03+00:00"}
