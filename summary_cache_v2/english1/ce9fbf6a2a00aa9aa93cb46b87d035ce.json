{"summary": "The script configures and launches a Megatron BART language model pretraining job using NVIDIA NeMo. It parses a Hydra configuration, sets up experiment management, logging, and a PyTorch Lightning trainer with custom plugins for mixed‑precision, gradient scaling, and distributed data parallelism, then instantiates the MegatronBARTModel and runs training.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example that demonstrates how to pretrain a large‑scale Megatron BART model for language modeling tasks, enabling users to leverage NeMo's distributed training and mixed‑precision capabilities for building downstream NLP applications.", "keywords": ["Megatron BART", "pretraining", "language modeling", "NeMo", "Hydra", "PyTorch Lightning", "distributed training", "mixed precision", "gradient scaling", "experiment manager"], "summary_hash": "24d52aa243cf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:43:25+00:00"}
