{"summary": "The module provides a suite of tools for locating and characterising three‑dimensional magnetic null points in plasma simulations. It defines abstract point representations, specialised null‑point objects, and a hierarchy of warnings and exceptions to handle issues such as multiple nearby nulls or non‑zero divergence. A collection of numerical helpers implements bilinear/trilinear interpolation, Jacobian evaluation and root‑finding algorithms that underpin the null‑point detection process.", "business_intent": "Support plasma‑physics research by offering reliable detection and analysis of magnetic null points, which are critical for studying magnetic reconnection, field topology and stability in computational and observational datasets.", "keywords": ["magnetic null point", "3D magnetic field", "plasma analysis", "root finding", "trilinear interpolation", "Jacobian", "divergence check", "warnings", "exceptions"], "summary_hash": "4dad3f568f99", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:05:31+00:00"}
