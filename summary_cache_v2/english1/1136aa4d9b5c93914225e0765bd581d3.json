{"summary": "Defines a high‑level pipeline that orchestrates the consistency‑model image synthesis process. It creates latent tensors, optionally adds class conditioning, iteratively denoises them with a UNet and a stochastic scheduler, and finally decodes the latents into RGB images.", "business_intent": "Offers developers and researchers an out‑of‑the‑box, easy‑to‑use component for fast, high‑quality image generation using consistency models, facilitating integration into applications such as content creation, prototyping, and AI‑driven visual tools.", "keywords": ["consistency model", "image synthesis", "diffusion pipeline", "UNet denoiser", "stochastic scheduler", "latent preparation", "conditional generation", "decoding", "AI art", "diffusers"], "summary_hash": "3a54c53bebd8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:41:07+00:00"}
