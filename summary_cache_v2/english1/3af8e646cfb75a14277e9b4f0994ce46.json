{"summary": "This module contains a collection of unit tests that verify the functionality of Lightning's data connector component. It defines lightweight stub models and data modules to exercise scenarios such as data hook selection, dataloader source handling, sampler replacement, persistent worker warnings, iterable validation, and error conditions related to batch limits and distributed training. The tests assert correct warning emission, proper configuration handling, and robust error raising for mis‑configured data pipelines.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the data loading infrastructure of the Lightning training framework, ensuring that users receive accurate warnings and errors when configuring dataloaders, hooks, and distributed samplers, thereby improving reliability and developer experience.", "keywords": ["Lightning", "Trainer", "DataConnector", "DataLoader", "hooks", "distributed sampler", "warnings", "validation", "unit tests", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "012f6628dd0e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:42:46+00:00"}
