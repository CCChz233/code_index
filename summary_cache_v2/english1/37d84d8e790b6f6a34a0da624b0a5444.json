{"summary": "The package implements a ctypes‑based foreign‑function interface for the Deep Graph Library, translating low‑level C APIs into Python objects. It supplies generic wrappers for library functions, array structures, and generic objects, handling argument conversion, return value processing, lifecycle management, and registration of extensions.", "business_intent": "To provide a seamless and efficient bridge between Python code and DGL’s high‑performance C backend, enabling developers to invoke graph operations, manipulate tensors, and manage library objects directly from Python while abstracting away low‑level details.", "keywords": ["ctypes", "FFI", "DGL", "Python bindings", "C backend", "function wrapper", "NDArray", "object management", "type conversion", "graph library"], "summary_hash": "07dd1af52dfa", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:59:29+00:00"}
