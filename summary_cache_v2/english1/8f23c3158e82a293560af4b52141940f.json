{"summary": "Implements a multi‑layer perceptron that partitions its computation among multiple expert sub‑networks, using a learned routing mechanism to direct each input to a selected expert. The class relies on FairScale's Mixture‑of‑Experts implementation to achieve efficient parallelism and scaling, especially in distributed training setups.", "business_intent": "Offer a high‑performance, scalable neural network layer that reduces per‑token compute by routing data through a subset of experts, enabling larger MLP models to be trained efficiently across multiple devices.", "keywords": ["Mixture of Experts", "MLP", "distributed training", "FairScale", "Gshard", "expert routing", "model scaling", "parallelism", "neural network layer"], "summary_hash": "a8ff3bcc3107", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:21:27+00:00"}
