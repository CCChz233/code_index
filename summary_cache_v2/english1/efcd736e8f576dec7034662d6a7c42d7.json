{"summary": "A configuration container for the vision encoder of a BridgeTower multimodal model, encapsulating hyperparameters such as hidden dimension, number of visual transformer layers, patch and image resolution, initialization scaling, layer‑norm epsilon, gradient stopping, shared layer‑norm usage, and optional removal of the final encoder layer. It inherits from the generic pretrained configuration class to allow seamless loading of default values matching the BridgeTower‑base checkpoint and to be passed to model constructors.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to instantiate and customize the visual backbone of a BridgeTower model with sensible defaults, facilitating loading of pretrained weights, fine‑tuning, or architecture tweaks without hard‑coding values.", "keywords": ["vision encoder", "BridgeTower", "configuration", "hidden size", "transformer layers", "patch size", "image size", "layer normalization", "gradient control", "pretrained config", "multimodal model"], "summary_hash": "d3203115dc6c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:52:02+00:00"}
