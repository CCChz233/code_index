{"summary": "The package implements a collection of benchmark utilities for assessing the classification accuracy of various graph neural network architectures—including attention‑based, convolutional, relational, and inductive models—using DGL and PyTorch. Each file defines a specific GNN model, its training/evaluation loop, and helper routines for computing and recording accuracy on node or graph prediction tasks.", "business_intent": "To provide a standardized framework for measuring and comparing the predictive performance of different GNN models on graph‑structured datasets, enabling researchers and engineers to evaluate model suitability and guide selection for downstream applications.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "GAT", "GCN", "RGCN", "GraphSAGE", "DGL", "PyTorch", "benchmark", "model accuracy", "node classification", "graph classification", "heterogeneous graphs", "relational graphs", "evaluation metrics"], "summary_hash": "37a1a1265aa2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:48:41+00:00"}
