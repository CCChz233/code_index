{"summary": "Implements a discrete diffusion scheduler based on KDPM2 with ancestral sampling, offering configurable beta or sigma schedules (linear, scaled, Karras, exponential, beta), handling different prediction types (epsilon, sample, v_prediction), and managing timestep spacing and offsets. Includes utilities to convert schedules, initialize timesteps, add noise, scale model inputs, and execute a single sampling step.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible and efficient scheduler for diffusion model inference, enabling fast generation of images or videos by supporting multiple noise schedules and prediction modes within generative AI pipelines.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "KDPM2", "ancestral sampling", "beta schedule", "Karras sigma", "exponential sigma", "beta sigma", "prediction type", "timestep spacing", "steps offset", "noise addition", "model input scaling", "sampling step"], "summary_hash": "6c9608ded197", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:55:27+00:00"}
