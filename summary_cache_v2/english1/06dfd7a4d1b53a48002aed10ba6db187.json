{"summary": "A Python module that sets up a Feast feature repository for driver-related data stored in Snowflake. It defines the driver entity, configures Snowflake push and request sources, creates feature views for raw driver metrics, and adds an on‑demand feature view that calculates a transformed conversion rate using helper utilities.", "business_intent": "Enable a machine‑learning workflow to ingest, store, and serve driver features from Snowflake, providing both raw and derived metrics (e.g., conversion rate) for downstream models.", "keywords": ["Feast", "Snowflake", "feature repository", "driver data", "entity", "feature view", "on-demand feature view", "conversion rate", "feature engineering", "data source"], "summary_hash": "46c12c085e52", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:37:20+00:00"}
