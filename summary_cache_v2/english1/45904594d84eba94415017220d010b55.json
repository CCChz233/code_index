{"summary": "This module defines a comprehensive set of unit tests for CuPy's sorting capabilities. It exercises the GPU‑accelerated sorting primitives—including general sorting, argument sorting, partitioning, lexicographic sorting, and multi‑dimensional sorting—across a wide range of array shapes, data types (including complex and NaN‑containing values), memory layouts, and axis specifications, while also checking proper error handling for invalid inputs.", "business_intent": "Validate that CuPy's sorting operations behave correctly and consistently with NumPy, ensuring reliability, performance, and correctness for end‑users who rely on GPU‑based array sorting in scientific and data‑processing applications.", "keywords": ["sorting", "unit testing", "CuPy", "GPU arrays", "validation", "edge cases", "NaN handling", "complex numbers", "multi‑dimensional", "axis", "partition", "lexicographic sort"], "summary_hash": "6dd49a018872", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:24:15+00:00"}
