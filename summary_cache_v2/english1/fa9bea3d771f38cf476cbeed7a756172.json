{"summary": "A DGL‑based example that implements the node2vec graph embedding algorithm with PyTorch. It includes utilities for loading benchmark graphs, a model that performs biased random walks and skip‑gram training with negative sampling (supporting sparse embeddings), and a command‑line script to train the model or benchmark walk generation on datasets such as Cora and ogbn‑products.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run reference implementation for researchers and engineers to experiment with node2vec, generate node embeddings for downstream graph‑learning tasks, and compare performance against alternative frameworks.", "keywords": ["node2vec", "graph embedding", "DGL", "PyTorch", "biased random walks", "skip-gram", "negative sampling", "sparse embeddings", "Cora", "ogbn-products", "benchmark"], "summary_hash": "9c3534c4f16f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:51:16+00:00"}
