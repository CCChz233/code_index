{"summary": "The xformers.sparse package implements sparse tensor data structures and core linear‑algebra primitives for deep‑learning models. It provides CSR‑based tensors, block‑sparse tensors, and associated utilities for conversion, masked multiplication, softmax, and gradient computation, all tightly integrated with PyTorch’s dispatch system.", "business_intent": "To accelerate training and inference of large neural networks by exploiting sparsity, reducing memory footprint and compute cost, and offering ready‑to‑use sparse operations for transformer‑style architectures.", "keywords": ["sparse tensors", "CSR", "block-sparse", "PyTorch", "matrix multiplication", "softmax", "gradient support", "conversion utilities", "deep learning efficiency"], "summary_hash": "30185bc69388", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:34:15+00:00"}
