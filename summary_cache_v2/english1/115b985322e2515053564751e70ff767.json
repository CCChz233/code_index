{"summary": "The module implements a configurable RetinaNet‑style object detection solution for medical imaging, offering both the core network that extracts multi‑scale features and predicts per‑anchor class scores and bounding‑box offsets, and a high‑level detector wrapper that handles anchor generation, ground‑truth matching, loss computation, and post‑processing (including optional sliding‑window inference) for 2‑D and 3‑D data.", "business_intent": "To provide researchers and developers with an out‑of‑the‑box, flexible RetinaNet implementation that can be readily integrated into medical imaging pipelines for detecting anatomical structures or pathologies, accelerating model development, training, and deployment in clinical or research settings.", "keywords": ["RetinaNet", "object detection", "medical imaging", "2D", "3D", "anchor generation", "ground truth matching", "loss calculation", "inference", "sliding window", "feature extractor", "multi‑scale feature maps", "classification scores", "bounding box regression", "configurable"], "summary_hash": "9820120dd6c4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:32:10+00:00"}
