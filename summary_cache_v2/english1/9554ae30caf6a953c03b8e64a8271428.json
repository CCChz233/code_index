{"summary": "Implements a composite loss function designed for the HoVer‑Net model used in digital pathology. The loss combines Dice loss for nuclear segmentation, cross‑entropy loss for classification, and Sobel‑gradient based losses for horizontal and vertical distance map predictions, enabling precise nuclei detection and instance separation during model training.", "business_intent": "Provide a specialized training objective that enhances the accuracy of nuclei segmentation and instance separation in pathology images, supporting research and clinical workflows that rely on automated histopathology analysis.", "keywords": ["HoVer-Net", "composite loss", "Dice loss", "cross-entropy", "Sobel gradient", "nuclei detection", "instance segmentation", "digital pathology", "deep learning", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "24b65b91e38e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:31:55+00:00"}
