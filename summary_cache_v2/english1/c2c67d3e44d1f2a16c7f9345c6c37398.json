{"summary": "The module implements elliptic‑curve digital signature (ECDSA) key handling, providing classes for private signing keys and public verifying keys. It supports generating keys, loading and exporting them in PEM/DER and other encodings, and performing signing and verification operations using various hash algorithms.", "business_intent": "Enable applications to securely create, store, transmit, and use ECDSA keys for generating and validating digital signatures, facilitating authentication and integrity checks in cryptographic workflows.", "keywords": ["ECDSA", "signing key", "verifying key", "elliptic curve", "digital signature", "key generation", "key serialization", "PEM", "DER", "signature verification", "cryptography"], "summary_hash": "d28a7fd5b8c6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:40:21+00:00"}
