{"summary": "This module implements a comprehensive tuberculosis (TB) disease model within a population health simulation. It simulates acquisition of infection, the natural history of latent and active disease, diagnostic screening processes, initiation and follow‑up of treatment regimens, provision of preventive therapy, outcomes including mortality and self‑cure, and incorporates programmatic activities such as periodic scaling‑up and routine polling events to update the TB burden over time.", "business_intent": "To enable analysts and policymakers to evaluate TB control strategies, resource needs, and health‑system impacts by providing a detailed, event‑driven representation of TB transmission, diagnosis, treatment pathways, and outcomes in a simulated population.", "keywords": ["tuberculosis", "TB", "infection acquisition", "disease progression", "latent infection", "active disease", "diagnostic screening", "treatment initiation", "treatment follow‑up", "preventive therapy", "mortality", "self‑cure", "health‑system simulation", "program scaling", "regular polling", "disease burden"], "summary_hash": "3abf0079d643", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:02:00+00:00"}
