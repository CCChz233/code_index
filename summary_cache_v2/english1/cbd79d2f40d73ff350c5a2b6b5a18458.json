{"summary": "This module implements a hybrid automatic speech recognition model that combines an encoder‑decoder RNNT architecture with an auxiliary CTC decoder and loss, using byte‑pair‑encoding (BPE) subword tokenization. It encapsulates data loading for training and inference, supports dynamic switching of decoding strategies and vocabularies, and registers compatible model variants.", "business_intent": "Offer a versatile, high‑accuracy ASR solution that leverages both RNNT and CTC objectives together with subword tokenization, enabling developers to efficiently train, fine‑tune, and deploy speech‑to‑text systems with customizable decoding and vocabulary handling.", "keywords": ["speech recognition", "RNNT", "CTC", "hybrid model", "BPE tokenization", "encoder‑decoder", "ASR", "decoding strategy", "training data loading", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "3c556497de02", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:10:44+00:00"}
