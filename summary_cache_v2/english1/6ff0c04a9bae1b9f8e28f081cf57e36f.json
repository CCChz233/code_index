{"summary": "The class encapsulates a single-qubit Y‑axis rotation gate, defining its matrix representation, symbolic circuit symbol, and integration with quantum circuits. It provides core functionality such as equality checking, array conversion, and supports derived operations like controlled versions, inversion, and exponentiation.", "business_intent": "To give quantum programmers a reusable, mathematically precise component for applying Y‑rotations within circuits, facilitating algorithm design, simulation, and compilation across Qiskit workflows.", "keywords": ["Y rotation", "single-qubit gate", "quantum gate", "matrix representation", "controlled operation", "inverse", "exponentiation", "Qiskit", "quantum circuit"], "summary_hash": "6cda85d1c22d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:29:42+00:00"}
