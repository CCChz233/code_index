{"summary": "Provides a dataset class that reads sentences with multiple intent labels and corresponding slot annotations, tokenizes and processes them for joint multi‑label intent detection and slot filling using a pretrained language model. Handles lower‑casing, truncation/padding to a fixed length, creates attention and label masks, and can sample a subset for quick experiments.", "business_intent": "Facilitates building and training conversational AI models that simultaneously predict multiple user intents and extract slot entities from utterances.", "keywords": ["multi-label intent classification", "slot filling", "dataset preprocessing", "tokenization", "padding", "masking", "NeMo", "NLP", "pretrained language model", "conversation AI"], "summary_hash": "2457b083eeca", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:29:21+00:00"}
