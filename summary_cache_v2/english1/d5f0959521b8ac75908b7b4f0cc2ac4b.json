{"summary": "This module provides a suite of unit tests for Django admin list filter functionality, defining custom filter classes that manipulate querysets, generate decade‑based and dynamic lookups, handle non‑string values and exclusion logic, and deliberately trigger errors. The tests verify that these filters integrate correctly with the admin change list and behave as expected across various scenarios, using a helper selection function to simulate user choices.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the behavior of Django admin list filters, ensuring that both built‑in and custom filter implementations work correctly, handle edge cases gracefully, and do not introduce regressions in the admin interface.", "keywords": ["Django", "admin", "list filter", "unit test", "custom filter", "queryset", "lookup", "decade filter", "boolean filter", "related filter", "choice filter", "error handling", "dynamic values", "non‑string field"], "summary_hash": "445878f2aa89", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:36:17+00:00"}
