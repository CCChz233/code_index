{"summary": "Implements a flexible residual block that can adjust channel dimensions, optionally perform up‑ or down‑sampling, and support gradient checkpointing. It handles 1D, 2D, or 3D data and can use either a 1×1 or spatial convolution in the skip connection to match output channels.", "business_intent": "Provide an efficient, configurable building unit for deep neural networks that maintains residual connections while allowing channel reshaping and spatial scaling, improving model performance and training stability.", "keywords": ["residual block", "channel adaptation", "upsampling", "downsampling", "gradient checkpointing", "spatial convolution", "multi‑dimensional", "deep learning", "efficient architecture"], "summary_hash": "f4bceb8de275", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:01:07+00:00"}
