{"summary": "This module implements a comprehensive wrapper around OpenAI‑compatible services, offering unified classes to perform chat and text completions, embeddings, image generation, speech synthesis, file management, batch processing, and assistant workflows. It abstracts provider‑specific details for OpenAI, DeepInfra, and Mistral, handling both synchronous and asynchronous calls, streaming responses, configuration translation, and standardized error handling.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with a single, consistent interface to integrate a wide range of OpenAI‑style AI capabilities into their applications, simplifying multi‑provider support, reducing boilerplate code, and enabling scalable, production‑ready interactions with language, vision, and speech models.", "keywords": ["OpenAI", "API wrapper", "chat completion", "text completion", "embeddings", "image generation", "speech synthesis", "assistants", "batch processing", "file management", "async", "streaming", "error handling", "provider abstraction", "DeepInfra", "Mistral", "configuration"], "summary_hash": "93803571cca7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:53:48+00:00"}
