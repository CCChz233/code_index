{"summary": "The positional embedding package supplies a collection of interchangeable components that generate position‑dependent vectors for sequence models. It defines a common abstract base, registers concrete implementations (learnable, sinusoidal, rotary, and vocabulary‑based embeddings), and provides a factory to instantiate the appropriate embedding based on configuration.", "business_intent": "To give transformer‑style architectures a flexible, plug‑and‑play way to encode token order, improving model accuracy on sequential data while allowing easy experimentation with different positional encoding strategies.", "keywords": ["positional embedding", "transformer", "sequence encoding", "sinusoidal", "rotary", "learnable", "vocabulary embedding", "registry", "factory pattern", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "27bb86ec1ab4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:34:54+00:00"}
