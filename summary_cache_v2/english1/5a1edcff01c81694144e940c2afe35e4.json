{"summary": "This module implements a fast greedy decoder for Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) models used in automatic speech recognition. It converts model log‑probabilities into token sequences, supports both single‑sample and batch decoding, handles the blank token, optionally records alignment histories, computes per‑token timestamps, and can produce per‑frame confidence scores using configurable confidence methods such as max probability and entropy‑based measures.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient, real‑time transcription and captioning by providing a lightweight inference decoder that transforms acoustic model outputs into readable text with optional confidence and timing information, facilitating downstream ASR applications and services.", "keywords": ["greedy decoding", "CTC", "speech recognition", "inference", "confidence scoring", "timestamps", "alignment", "batch processing", "NeMo", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "42eca28ec6d1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:16:01+00:00"}
