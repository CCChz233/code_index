{"summary": "A comprehensive test suite for the Prefect orchestration engine that validates API health checks, flow and task run creation, subflow handling, pause and resume mechanics (including out‑of‑process scenarios), state transitions, retry logic, result linking, crash classification, and dynamic key management. The file also provides utility helpers for constructing mock flows, tasks, and result factories used throughout the tests.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the workflow execution platform reliably manages runs, handles errors, respects pause/resume signals, correctly maps states to results, and maintains API availability, thereby ensuring stable and predictable automation for end‑users.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "engine testing", "flow run", "task run", "orchestration", "state management", "pause", "resume", "suspend", "subflow", "API healthcheck", "result linking", "crash detection", "retry logic", "async testing", "mock utilities"], "summary_hash": "9265f8a83d82", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:08:15+00:00"}
