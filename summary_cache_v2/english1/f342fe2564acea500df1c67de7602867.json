{"summary": "The module implements two layer‑normalization layers tailored for Megatron‑based NLP models. One variant initializes full parameters, while the other uses a single learnable scaling factor, both performing input normalization and offering parameter reinitialization, with support for automatic mixed‑precision casting.", "business_intent": "Enable stable and efficient training of large language models by providing lightweight, high‑performance normalization layers that work with mixed‑precision and Megatron parallelism.", "keywords": ["layer normalization", "Megatron", "NLP", "PyTorch", "mixed precision", "scaling factor", "parameter reinitialization", "neural network stability"], "summary_hash": "f0cff5d07781", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:24:21+00:00"}
