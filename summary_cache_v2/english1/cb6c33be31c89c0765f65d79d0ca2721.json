{"summary": "The module provides an internal helper that gathers, validates, and configures all callbacks required for a Lightning trainer run. It merges user‑defined callbacks with default ones (checkpointing, model summary, progress bar, timer, etc.), links model‑specific callbacks, sets up logging hooks, and determines the execution order before training starts.", "business_intent": "Automate and centralize the management of training callbacks so that users get consistent checkpointing, progress reporting, logging, and other utilities without manual setup, improving usability and reliability of the training workflow.", "keywords": ["callbacks", "trainer", "checkpointing", "model summary", "progress bar", "timer", "logging", "configuration", "PyTorch Lightning", "callback ordering"], "summary_hash": "ff61e2217226", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:00:27+00:00"}
