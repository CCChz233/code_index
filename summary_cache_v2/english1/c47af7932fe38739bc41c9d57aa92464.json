{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class NoInitFields. It seems to be a dataclass with fields that have default values but no __init__ parameters? The docstring shows that calling NoInitFields() returns an instance with default values: has_default=DummyObj(), has_factory='From a lambda', neither=None. Also, NoInitFields().has_default is NoInitFields().has_default True, meaning default is a shared object (maybe default_factory?).
