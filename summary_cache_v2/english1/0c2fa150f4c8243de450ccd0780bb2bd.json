{"summary": "Implements a NeMo model that provides an end‑to‑end pipeline for converting natural‑language questions into SPARQL queries. It configures tokenizers, loads the Text2Sparql dataset, builds a transformer encoder‑decoder (e.g., BART), and defines training, validation, and testing logic with metrics such as perplexity, orchestrated via PyTorch Lightning.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to train and deploy models that automatically translate user utterances into SPARQL queries for querying knowledge graphs, facilitating natural‑language interfaces to structured data.", "keywords": ["natural language processing", "SPARQL", "knowledge graph", "transformer", "encoder-decoder", "BART", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "text-to-SPARQL", "training pipeline", "perplexity metric"], "summary_hash": "1cf80fe560a8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:11:29+00:00"}
