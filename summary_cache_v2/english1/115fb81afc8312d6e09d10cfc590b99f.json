{"summary": "A collection of low‑level utilities that perform image cropping and optional padding, and that update related annotations such as bounding boxes and keypoints. It includes helpers to compute crop coordinates (centered or arbitrary) and to apply the transformations while preserving channel dimensions.", "business_intent": "Support computer‑vision data augmentation pipelines by providing reliable spatial cropping operations that keep image metadata (e.g., detection boxes, pose keypoints) consistent, thereby improving model robustness for tasks like object detection and pose estimation.", "keywords": ["image cropping", "padding", "bounding box adjustment", "keypoint transformation", "augmentation", "computer vision", "spatial transformation", "coordinate calculation"], "summary_hash": "6a6a67b4a742", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:28:31+00:00"}
