{"summary": "The module implements a tokenizer that converts tabular structures into linear token sequences and can reconstruct the original tables. It encodes column values using predefined column codes, inserts special markers for row and document boundaries, and operates with a fixed vocabulary to produce token IDs suitable for language models.", "business_intent": "Enable language models to ingest, process, and generate tabular data by providing a reliable conversion between tables and token streams, supporting downstream tasks such as table understanding, data-to-text generation, and tabular classification.", "keywords": ["tabular tokenization", "column encoding", "special markers", "fixed vocabulary", "token sequence", "data reconstruction", "preprocessing", "language model input"], "summary_hash": "9e22b2288555", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:52:44+00:00"}
