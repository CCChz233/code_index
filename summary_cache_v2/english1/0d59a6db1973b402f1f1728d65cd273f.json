{"summary": "A test suite that verifies the functionality of various text‑to‑speech feature processing components, including scaling, log compression with optional clamping, mean‑variance normalization (standard and masked), and speaker‑specific normalization (standard and masked). It also supplies utilities for creating synthetic feature dictionaries used in the tests.", "business_intent": "Provide automated validation to ensure that TTS preprocessing modules work correctly and remain stable across code changes, preventing regressions that could degrade downstream speech synthesis performance.", "keywords": ["TTS", "feature processing", "scaling", "log compression", "mean variance normalization", "speaker normalization", "unit testing", "pytest", "numpy", "torch", "audio preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "44f281367aa2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:32:12+00:00"}
