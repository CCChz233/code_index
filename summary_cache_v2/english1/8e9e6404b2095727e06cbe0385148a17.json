{"summary": "Implements a parallel training strategy that leverages PyTorch's DataParallel to run a model on multiple GPUs within a single process. The strategy manages device placement, forward and backward passes, gradient synchronization, and checkpoint handling while integrating with Lightning Fabric's accelerator, precision, and I/O plugins.", "business_intent": "Enable users to scale model training across several GPUs easily, without the complexity of distributed training, by providing a ready‑to‑use DataParallel strategy compatible with Lightning Fabric's ecosystem.", "keywords": ["DataParallel", "multi‑GPU", "parallel strategy", "Lightning Fabric", "device placement", "gradient reduction", "checkpoint I/O", "accelerator", "precision", "torch.nn.DataParallel"], "summary_hash": "b343dc2c8123", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:02:26+00:00"}
