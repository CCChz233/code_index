{"summary": "Implements a configurable 2‑dimensional transformer architecture for processing latent image tensors, typically used in diffusion models. The model splits inputs into patches, runs them through a stack of transformer blocks with multi‑head self‑attention, adaptive layer‑norm, feed‑forward layers, and optional dropout or up‑casting, and produces a transformed tensor with optional channel conversion.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, high‑capacity backbone that can be integrated into image generation, denoising, or other computer‑vision pipelines requiring powerful 2‑D attention mechanisms, while allowing fine‑grained control over depth, head count, dimensionality, and normalization to meet diverse performance and resource constraints.", "keywords": ["2D transformer", "patch embedding", "multi-head attention", "adaptive layer norm", "diffusion models", "image generation", "latent representation", "configurable depth", "dropout", "feed-forward network", "vision transformer"], "summary_hash": "5d204674bc12", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:30:16+00:00"}
