{"summary": "This module integrates with Vertex AI and Google AI Studio to facilitate image generation requests. It includes a handler that manages synchronous and asynchronous API calls, validates responses, and converts results into a uniform image representation, as well as a utility that computes the monetary cost of each generation request based on model pricing and usage details.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with a seamless way to generate images via Vertex AI/Google AI Studio while offering transparent cost estimation for budgeting and billing purposes.", "keywords": ["image generation", "Vertex AI", "Google AI Studio", "cost estimation", "API handler", "synchronous", "asynchronous", "HTTP communication", "response validation", "standard image objects"], "summary_hash": "8b8e029a932c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:10:18+00:00"}
