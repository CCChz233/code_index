{"summary": "The module defines two neural network components for graph‑structured data: a graph convolutional network that generates node embeddings via DGL’s GraphConv layers, and a lightweight rectangular transformation layer that maps these embeddings to a target space. Together they form the core model used for downstream graph learning tasks.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to build and deploy graph neural network models for applications such as node classification, link prediction, or recommendation systems by providing ready‑to‑use GCN and embedding transformation layers.", "keywords": ["graph convolutional network", "GCN", "rectangular transformation layer", "DGL", "PyTorch", "node embeddings", "graph neural network", "deep learning", "representation learning", "graph data"], "summary_hash": "ba7947dd8c9f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:20:09+00:00"}
