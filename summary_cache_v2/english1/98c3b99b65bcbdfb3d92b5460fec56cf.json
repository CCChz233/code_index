{"summary": "The transform package supplies a configurable pipeline for preprocessing document text, allowing developers to compose and apply a series of transformation steps such as language filtering, length limiting, and custom processing. It parses textual specifications, creates appropriate transformation objects, and manages their sequential execution on individual strings or collections of documents.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and reusable text preprocessing to improve downstream annotation or classification tasks by ensuring inputs meet language and size requirements before further analysis.", "keywords": ["text preprocessing", "pipeline", "configurable transforms", "language detection", "input length limiting", "document processing", "annotation", "classification"], "summary_hash": "2ca2977ba6d5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:37:09+00:00"}
