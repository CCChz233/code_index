{"summary": "This module implements a lightweight variational autoencoder that encodes images into compact latent tensors and decodes them back to images. It offers configurable channel sizes, block depths, activation functions, and latent scaling, and supports tiled processing and precision upcasting for efficient inference.", "business_intent": "Provide an efficient, low‑resource autoencoding component for diffusion‑based image generation pipelines, enabling fast encoding/decoding and reduced memory usage in production or edge environments.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "tiny", "latent encoding", "image reconstruction", "configurable architecture", "tiled processing", "precision upcasting", "latent scaling", "PyTorch", "diffusion models"], "summary_hash": "c671d28a9214", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:29:31+00:00"}
