{"summary": "The file defines a core class representing a remote array and a suite of helper functions for array operations, statistical calculations, and server interactions. The class encapsulates metadata and provides Pythonic interfaces for arithmetic, logical, reduction, and I/O operations, delegating computation to the server. Helper functions offer shortcuts for common tasks like aggregation, statistical measures, and array manipulation, often wrapping class methods or server calls.", "business_intent": "Enable large‑scale, distributed data analysis by allowing users to work with massive arrays through familiar Python syntax while offloading storage and computation to a remote server, improving scalability and performance.", "keywords": ["remote array", "server‑side computation", "distributed analytics", "Pythonic API", "statistical functions", "aggregation", "array manipulation", "large‑scale data processing"], "summary_hash": "22e40bfec2f4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:22:37+00:00"}
