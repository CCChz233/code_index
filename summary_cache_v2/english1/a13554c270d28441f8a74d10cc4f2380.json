{"summary": "The module defines a collection of utility functions that generate continuous-time waveform samples for quantum control pulses. Each function returns an array representing the amplitude of a specific shape (e.g., constant, sinusoidal, square, triangular, Gaussian, DRAG, hyperbolic‑secant, etc.) and includes validation of parameters such as duration and width.", "business_intent": "Enable users of the quantum pulse framework to easily create standard analog pulse shapes without manually coding the mathematics, thereby simplifying the construction of pulse schedules for quantum hardware.", "keywords": ["quantum pulse", "waveform generation", "continuous signal", "Qiskit", "control envelope", "sinusoid", "square wave", "triangle wave", "sawtooth", "Gaussian envelope", "DRAG", "hyperbolic secant", "signal processing"], "summary_hash": "8a5a4d5599f5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:05:49+00:00"}
