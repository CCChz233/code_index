{"summary": "Implements the joint network of a Recurrent Neural Network Transducer, merging encoder and prediction representations through a configurable feed‑forward module, applying an activation function and optional dropout, and producing log‑probabilities over the output vocabulary (including the blank token). It also supports optional fused computation of the transducer loss and word‑error‑rate to reduce memory usage, and provides utilities for adapters, export preparation, and input‑output type handling.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient training and inference of speech‑to‑text models based on the RNN‑T architecture by providing a flexible, memory‑aware joint computation layer that can directly output loss and WER metrics, facilitating deployment in production speech recognition systems.", "keywords": ["RNN‑T", "joint network", "speech recognition", "encoder‑prediction fusion", "feedforward layer", "activation function", "dropout", "loss calculation", "word error rate", "memory optimization", "fused processing", "adapter support", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "f58409dc2b68", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:13:34+00:00"}
