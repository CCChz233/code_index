{"summary": "The module defines a class that manages precipitation and evapotranspiration raster grids required by the MetaSWAP hydrological model. It validates the presence of a time dimension, constructs appropriate file names, and exports the grids as ESRI ASCII files compatible with MetaSWAP.", "business_intent": "Enable users to prepare and export meteorological raster datasets in the correct format and temporal structure for seamless integration into MetaSWAP simulations.", "keywords": ["precipitation", "evapotranspiration", "raster grid", "ESRI ASCII", "MetaSWAP", "time dimension", "data validation", "hydrological modeling", "GIS", "grid export"], "summary_hash": "e7c0059c0bec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:43:56+00:00"}
