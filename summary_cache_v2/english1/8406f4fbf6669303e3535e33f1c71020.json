{"summary": "Provides a collection of KAK‑based algorithms to decompose any two‑qubit unitary into a circuit composed of a minimal number of entangling two‑qubit gates (such as CX or a user‑specified basis) surrounded by single‑qubit rotations, including exact, approximate, diagonal‑up‑to, controlled‑U, and Weyl‑canonical forms, together with lazy caching utilities and helper functions for fidelity and serialization.", "business_intent": "Allows quantum programmers and hardware engineers to automatically translate arbitrary two‑qubit operations into efficient, hardware‑native gate sequences, supporting circuit optimization, benchmarking, and validation across different quantum back‑ends.", "keywords": ["two-qubit", "KAK decomposition", "Weyl decomposition", "circuit synthesis", "minimal entangling gates", "approximate decomposition", "controlled-U", "diagonal up to", "lazy caching", "quantum compilation"], "summary_hash": "6fc115311ccf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:59:13+00:00"}
