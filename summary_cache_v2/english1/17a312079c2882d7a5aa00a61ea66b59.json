{"summary": "This test module validates the behavior of the lowest‑latency routing strategy in the Litellm library. It sets up mock deployments, exercises helper utilities, and runs a series of unit tests that verify deployment discovery, rate‑limit enforcement, latency measurement, TTL handling, buffering, first‑pick logic, time‑to‑first‑token tracking, timeout handling, and streaming response support.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that the routing component reliably selects the fastest available model deployment while respecting usage limits and maintaining performance metrics, thereby ensuring high‑quality, low‑latency AI service delivery in production environments.", "keywords": ["litellm", "lowest latency routing", "unit tests", "deployment selection", "rate limiting", "latency tracking", "TTL", "buffering", "timeouts", "streaming", "pytest", "async"], "summary_hash": "cb3baa483aff", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:24:49+00:00"}
