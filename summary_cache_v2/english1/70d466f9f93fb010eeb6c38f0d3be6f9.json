{"summary": "This module supplies scripts for preparing large heterogeneous graphs and executing a distributed relational graph convolutional network to perform entity classification. It includes utilities for graph partitioning, distributed embedding handling, graph convolution with basis decomposition, and orchestrates training and evaluation across multiple machines using DGL's distributed runtime.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, high‑performance training of RGCN models on massive multi‑relational graphs by distributing computation over several nodes and GPUs, thereby accelerating research and production workflows that require node classification on large‑scale graph data.", "keywords": ["distributed training", "relational graph convolutional network", "entity classification", "graph partitioning", "DGL", "PyTorch", "heterogeneous graph", "sparse embedding", "multi‑GPU", "multi‑node"], "summary_hash": "955d5e7250db", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:58:07+00:00"}
