{"summary": "The module demonstrates how to construct and analyze a 2‑D quadrilateral finite element using an isoparametric formulation. It defines lightweight classes for element behavior, isotropic material properties, and a demo element, and provides helper routines for shape functions, gradients, interpolation, and matrix assembly, culminating in a simple example validated against PyMAPDL.", "business_intent": "Provide an educational example that teaches engineers and students how to implement basic finite element analysis in Python and integrate it with ANSYS MAPDL for verification.", "keywords": ["finite element", "isoparametric", "quadrilateral element", "shape functions", "stiffness matrix", "isotropic material", "PyMAPDL", "Python", "engineering simulation", "educational demo"], "summary_hash": "71983e826316", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:57:32+00:00"}
