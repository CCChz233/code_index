{"summary": "This module contains a comprehensive test suite for the VF2Layout transpiler pass in Qiskit. It defines several test classes that verify the algorithm’s ability to generate valid qubit layouts across different back‑ends, coupling maps, and circuit structures, including multiple trial execution, custom scoring, lattice embedding, three‑qubit gates, and control‑flow constructs, while also checking error handling and performance constraints.", "business_intent": "Validate and guarantee the correctness, robustness, and performance of the VF2Layout mapping algorithm so that quantum circuits can be reliably placed onto hardware topologies during transpilation.", "keywords": ["VF2Layout", "Qiskit", "transpiler", "layout mapping", "coupling map", "backend testing", "quantum circuit", "graph state", "embedding", "multiple trials", "custom scoring", "error map", "control flow", "unit tests"], "summary_hash": "35a67c42252b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:45:11+00:00"}
