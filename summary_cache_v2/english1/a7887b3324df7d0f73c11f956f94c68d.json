{"summary": "This module defines a suite of unit tests that verify the GateDirection transpiler pass in Qiskit. The tests check that the pass correctly respects hardware coupling maps and target specifications when determining the allowed direction of two‑qubit gates, handles calibrated and custom gates, and raises appropriate errors for unsupported configurations.", "business_intent": "Validate that quantum circuit transpilation enforces hardware connectivity constraints, ensuring generated circuits are compatible with the target device and reducing execution errors.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "transpiler", "GateDirection", "unit tests", "coupling map", "target specification", "gate direction", "calibrated gates", "hardware constraints", "quantum compilation"], "summary_hash": "d97e87625b5d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:48:19+00:00"}
