{"summary": "Implements a Shared Packed Parse Forest (SPPF) used by the Earley parser to represent ambiguous parse results. Defines node types for symbols, tokens, and packed derivations, and provides visitors and transformers for traversing, aggregating priorities, converting the forest to concrete parse trees, visualising it with GraphViz, and performing generic bottom‑up transformations.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient handling of ambiguous grammars in the Earley parsing engine, allowing downstream applications to resolve ambiguities, apply rule priorities, generate parse trees, and visualise parse structures without re‑parsing.", "keywords": ["Earley parser", "shared packed parse forest", "SPPF", "ambiguity resolution", "priority propagation", "parse tree conversion", "visitor pattern", "transformer", "graphviz", "token node", "symbol node", "packed node"], "summary_hash": "50de2c9c8ab7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:47:20+00:00"}
