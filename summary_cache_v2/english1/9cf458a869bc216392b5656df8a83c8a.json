{"summary": "This module centralises configuration handling for the OpenMAStr project. It sets up console and file logging, manages creation of project and data directories, generates and stores filenames for various data artefacts, and provides accessor utilities for configuration values such as data version paths and output locations. It also supports loading and persisting API‑key related settings via YAML.", "business_intent": "Provide a unified, reusable way to initialise logging, organise filesystem layout, and expose configuration parameters so that other components can reliably read/write data, track versions, and record operational events without duplicating setup code.", "keywords": ["configuration", "logging", "directory management", "filename generation", "data versioning", "project home", "API keys", "YAML", "setup", "OpenMAStr"], "summary_hash": "8758c1178ee5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:07:40+00:00"}
