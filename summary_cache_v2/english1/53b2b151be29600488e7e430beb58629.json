{"summary": "Implements a text‑to‑image diffusion pipeline that transforms a textual prompt into a latent representation, denoises it using a UNet guided by a scheduler based on Rectified Flow with Euler discretization, decodes the latent into an image via a VAE, and optionally applies a safety checker to filter the output.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and creators with a reliable, high‑quality, and safe text‑to‑image generation tool for use in content creation, marketing, design, and rapid prototyping.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "diffusion", "rectified flow", "Euler discretization", "stable diffusion", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "prompt encoding", "latent preparation", "image decoding", "safety checking", "LoRA", "textual inversion"], "summary_hash": "458f7f4a07db", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:04:26+00:00"}
