{"summary": "The Dispersion class encapsulates the calculation of dispersion effects on solute concentration in a groundwater model. It computes explicit concentration changes or assembles the coefficient matrix for the dispersion term used by a matrix solver, supporting both isotropic and anisotropic dispersion through longitudinal dispersivity, horizontal and vertical transverse ratios, and optional molecular diffusion.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate simulation of contaminant transport and water‑quality dynamics in environmental and hydrogeological applications, providing modelers with configurable dispersion parameters for regional groundwater assessments.", "keywords": ["dispersion", "longitudinal dispersivity", "transverse dispersivity", "anisotropic dispersion", "diffusion coefficient", "matrix formulation", "groundwater modeling", "contaminant transport", "environmental simulation"], "summary_hash": "3dbc63bb1c1b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:32:35+00:00"}
