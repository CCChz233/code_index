{"summary": "This test module exercises the Qiskit high‑level synthesis transpiler pass, using mock operations and synthesis plugins to verify that configuration parameters, coupling maps, qubit selections and target specifications are correctly forwarded, that gate modifiers (control, inverse, power) are processed, that the token‑swapper permutation plugin synthesises permutation gates, and that the new pass remains compatible with the legacy unroll‑custom‑definitions behavior.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness, flexibility and backward‑compatibility of the high‑level synthesis transformation in Qiskit’s transpiler pipeline, ensuring that plugins receive proper context, modifiers are handled accurately, permutation synthesis works, and existing workflows continue to function after the refactor.", "keywords": ["high‑level synthesis", "transpiler pass", "Qiskit", "plugin manager", "synthesis plugins", "gate modifiers", "control inverse power", "token‑swapper", "permutation synthesis", "unroll custom definitions", "compatibility testing", "quantum circuit"], "summary_hash": "d428038bc478", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:47:56+00:00"}
