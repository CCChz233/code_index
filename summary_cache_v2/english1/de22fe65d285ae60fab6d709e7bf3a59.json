{"summary": "The package supplies a collection of reusable neural modules, utilities and services that form the building blocks for NeMo NLP models. It includes abstract encoder/decoder bases, wrappers for pretrained BERT and GPT models, classification and regression heads, token‑level classifiers, prompt‑tuning components, text‑generation strategies, and helper functions for tokenizers, language‑model configuration, and distributed generation. Additionally, it provides web and Flask servers for interactive or API‑driven text generation and retrieval‑augmented generation.", "business_intent": "Accelerate the creation, fine‑tuning and deployment of state‑of‑the‑art NLP solutions by offering standardized components and ready‑to‑use services, reducing engineering effort and time‑to‑market for applications such as chatbots, document retrieval, language generation, and token‑level labeling.", "keywords": ["NeMo", "NLP", "encoder", "decoder", "BERT", "GPT", "classification", "regression", "tokenization", "prompt tuning", "text generation", "retrieval‑augmented generation", "REST API", "web server", "utilities"], "summary_hash": "2712726f7ac0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:08:20+00:00"}
