{"summary": "The module provides a unified framework for loading, configuring, and handling vector spatial data within Raster Vision. It defines an abstract vector source interface, concrete implementations for GeoJSON files and vector tiles, utilities for inferring missing class identifiers, and default provider classes. Configuration objects and builders enable creation, validation, serialization (including protobuf), and command‑line updates of vector sources.", "business_intent": "To simplify the integration of vector map data into computer‑vision pipelines, allowing users to ingest, manage, and preprocess geographic features (e.g., for training or evaluation) across multiple formats with minimal setup.", "keywords": ["vector source", "GeoJSON", "vector tiles", "class inference", "configuration", "builder", "Raster Vision", "spatial data", "GIS", "protobuf", "shapely"], "summary_hash": "9cb8c910d11b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:05:03+00:00"}
