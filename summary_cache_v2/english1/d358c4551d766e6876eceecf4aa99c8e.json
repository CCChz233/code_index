{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that converts text prompts into images using the Stable UnCLIP architecture. It maps text to image embeddings with a prior transformer, applies a configurable noise schedule, denoises the latent representation with a UNet, and decodes the result into an image via a VAE. The class orchestrates tokenization, text encoding, scheduling, normalization, and provides helpers for prompt encoding, latent preparation, and noise handling.", "business_intent": "Offer developers and researchers a ready‑to‑use, extensible interface for high‑quality text‑to‑image generation, supporting custom LoRA or textual inversion weights and flexible device deployment.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "diffusion", "Stable UnCLIP", "prior transformer", "UNet", "VAE", "tokenizer", "scheduler", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "image generation"], "summary_hash": "2be480244391", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:25:31+00:00"}
