Methods include __call__, __init__, and many helper methods for processing prompts, latents, guidance, etc.\n\nWe need to summarize class responsibility and state/behavior. Business intent: generate images from text using advanced diffusion model, support fine-tuning via LoRA, textual inversion, IP adapters, etc. Keywords: text-to-image, diffusion, Matryoshka, pipeline, guidance, scheduler, UNet, tokenizer, encoder, LoRA, textual inversion, IP adapter, safety checker, latent preparation, etc.\n\nMake sure not to list method names verbatim.

It integrates a frozen T5 text encoder, tokenizer, a conditional UNet, a scheduler, and an image feature extractor for safety checking. It handles prompt encoding, latent initialization, guidance scaling, classifier‑free guidance, and optional adapters (LoRA, textual inversion, IP adapters). It provides utilities to adjust nesting levels, manage inference steps, and interrupt generation.\n\nBusiness intent: Provide a ready‑to‑use, extensible pipeline for developers and enterprises to generate high‑quality images from text, with support for model customization and safety features, enabling integration into creative applications, content generation platforms, or AI services.\n\nKeywords list.\n\nMake sure JSON format with double quotes.\n\nLet's craft.\n\nassistantfinal{\n  \"summary\": \"The class orchestrates the full text‑to‑image generation process using Matryoshka diffusion models.
