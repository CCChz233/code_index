{"summary": "This module defines comprehensive test suites for the Stable Diffusion SAG image generation pipeline, covering both full integration scenarios and fast unit-like checks. The tests validate correct pipeline execution, batch processing consistency, scheduler compatibility, deterministic behavior, and optional xformers attention support, using dummy components and real model configurations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability and correctness of the Stable Diffusion SAG pipeline across diverse configurations, preventing regressions and ensuring high‑quality image generation for downstream products and services.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "SAG pipeline", "image generation", "integration testing", "unit testing", "batch inference", "scheduler compatibility", "deterministic", "GPU", "torch", "diffusers", "transformers", "xformers", "IPAdapter"], "summary_hash": "ece0e8a35b8a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:54:02+00:00"}
