{"summary": "A utility module that centralizes detection of optional machine‑learning and system libraries, provides their version information, and retrieves environment metadata such as the current Git revision and Hugging Face library details. It offers simple boolean helpers to test whether each dependency is installed, enabling other parts of the benchmark suite to adapt to the available stack.", "business_intent": "Enable robust, reproducible benchmarking by programmatically verifying the presence and versions of required and optional ML frameworks and system tools, and by capturing environment identifiers for reporting and comparison across runs.", "keywords": ["dependency detection", "version checking", "environment introspection", "benchmark utilities", "optional libraries", "Git revision", "Hugging Face", "PyTorch", "TensorFlow", "ONNX", "Accelerate", "Transformers", "DeepSpeed", "LLM", "hardware awareness"], "summary_hash": "2fd743bf3cdd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:28:38+00:00"}
