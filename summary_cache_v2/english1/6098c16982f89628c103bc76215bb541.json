{"summary": "The module supplies a suite of cancellation utilities for both synchronous and asynchronous execution. It defines context managers that create cancellable scopes, enforce timeouts, translate alarm signals into exceptions, and protect critical sections from cross‑thread interruptions. Additional helpers expose deadline and timeout information and provide mechanisms to schedule cancellations at specific times.", "business_intent": "To give Prefect's runtime a reliable way to interrupt long‑running or blocked operations, enforce execution time limits, and safely shield code sections from external cancellation, thereby improving robustness and predictability of workflow execution.", "keywords": ["cancellation", "timeout", "async", "sync", "context manager", "alarm signal", "thread shielding", "deadline", "interruption", "concurrency"], "summary_hash": "4c49483fa97d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:33:19+00:00"}
