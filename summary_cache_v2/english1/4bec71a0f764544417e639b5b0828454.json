{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class HiveDeviceLight representing a Hive Active Light Device. Methods include brightness, color_temp, device_state_attributes, handle_update, hs_color, is_on, max_mireds, min_mireds, name, supported_features, turn_off, turn_on, update. So class responsibility: interface to control and monitor a smart light device (Hive). It provides state attributes, brightness, color temperature, color, on/off, update handling, etc. Business intent: integrate Hive smart lighting into home automation platforms, enable remote control, monitoring, and automation of lighting. Keywords: Hive, smart light, brightness, color temperature, hue-saturation, on/off, device state, home automation, integration, update, supported features.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed to ensure no method names verbatim.
