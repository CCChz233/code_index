{"summary": "The script demonstrates how to extend a monolingual sentence embedding model to multiple languages by training a multilingual student model that mimics the teacher model using parallel sentence data. It automatically downloads a large multilingual parallel corpus, prepares the dataset, configures training arguments, runs knowledge‑distillation training, and evaluates the resulting model.", "business_intent": "Enable users to create multilingual sentence‑embedding models from existing monolingual models, supporting multilingual NLP tasks such as cross‑language retrieval and similarity scoring.", "keywords": ["sentence embeddings", "multilingual", "knowledge distillation", "parallel corpus", "teacher model", "student model", "training", "evaluation", "translation data", "MSE loss"], "summary_hash": "c6bab5d06ecc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:57:45+00:00"}
