{"summary": "The class models a single‑qubit phase rotation about the Z axis, represented by a diagonal 2×2 matrix with entries (1, e^{iλ}). It can be realized virtually as a frame change, incurring no physical error or duration. Although functionally equivalent to a Z‑rotation (RZ) up to a global phase, the gate is deprecated in favor of the explicit phase gate or a generic U‑gate with zero X/Y components.", "business_intent": "Offer a convenient abstraction for applying a virtual Z‑axis phase shift within quantum circuits, enabling zero‑cost rotations while maintaining compatibility with legacy Qiskit code, but guide users toward the newer phase‑gate implementation.", "keywords": ["quantum gate", "Z rotation", "phase gate", "virtual Z", "diagonal gate", "single‑qubit", "deprecated", "Qiskit", "matrix representation", "RZ equivalence"], "summary_hash": "f67a9dc6b535", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:31:42+00:00"}
