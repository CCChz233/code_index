{"summary": "The module implements a set of composite solvers that combine individual graph‑based checks using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT). It provides an abstract foundation for complex solvers and concrete implementations that evaluate combined conditions across infrastructure‑as‑code graphs.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and reusable policy evaluation in Checkov by allowing simple checks to be composed into more expressive rules, improving the accuracy and maintainability of security and compliance analysis for IaC deployments.", "keywords": ["composite solver", "logical AND", "logical OR", "logical NOT", "infrastructure as code", "policy evaluation", "graph analysis", "Checkov", "abstract base class", "solver composition"], "summary_hash": "0e63caa7583e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:16:29+00:00"}
