{"summary": "Implements a configurable multi‑head attention layer with an optional feed‑forward sub‑network, supporting separate dropout rates for attention heads and other sub‑layers. The layer projects inputs into multiple attention heads, computes scaled dot‑product attention in parallel, concatenates the results, and applies a final linear transformation, making it suitable for Transformer‑style models and set‑based architectures.", "business_intent": "Offer a reusable neural network component that captures pairwise relationships among elements in sequences or sets, enabling developers to build high‑performance models for natural language processing, computer vision, and other domains that rely on attention mechanisms.", "keywords": ["multi-head attention", "transformer", "set transformer", "attention mechanism", "neural network layer", "dropout", "feed-forward network", "parallel heads", "scaled dot-product"], "summary_hash": "8b87efeea6c0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:51:01+00:00"}
