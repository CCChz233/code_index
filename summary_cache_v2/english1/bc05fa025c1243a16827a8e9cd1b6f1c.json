{"summary": "The module showcases a complete transfer‑learning workflow for image classification using PyTorch Lightning. It loads a small cats‑vs‑dogs dataset, defines a data handling component, builds a model that adapts a pretrained ResNet50 to the new task, and applies a three‑stage fine‑tuning schedule that progressively unfreezes layers with distinct learning‑rate groups. A command‑line interface ties everything together, allowing the experiment to be launched with a single command.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and data scientists with a ready‑to‑run example that illustrates how to efficiently fine‑tune pretrained vision models in production‑like settings, accelerating model development and serving as an educational reference for staged transfer learning.", "keywords": ["transfer learning", "fine‑tuning", "PyTorch Lightning", "ResNet50", "image classification", "cats and dogs dataset", "staged unfreezing", "learning rate groups", "CLI", "data module"], "summary_hash": "d20b851bea8a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:49:44+00:00"}
