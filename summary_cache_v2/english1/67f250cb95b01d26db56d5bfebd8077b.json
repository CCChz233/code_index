{"summary": "The module implements the scheduling logic for CogVideoX diffusion models, providing a DDIM‑based scheduler class that manages timesteps, beta schedules, noise addition, sample scaling, clipping, and dynamic thresholding. It also defines a lightweight output container for scheduler steps and includes helper utilities for beta computation and SNR rescaling.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and stable inference of video diffusion models by offering a configurable scheduler and supporting utilities that control noise schedules, timestep progression, and post‑processing of generated samples, thereby improving generation quality and adaptability.", "keywords": ["DDIM", "diffusion scheduler", "CogVideoX", "beta schedule", "noise addition", "timestep management", "dynamic thresholding", "sample clipping", "SNR rescaling", "output container"], "summary_hash": "2caf5896aa6b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:14:36+00:00"}
