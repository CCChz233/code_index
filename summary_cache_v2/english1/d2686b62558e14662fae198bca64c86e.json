{"summary": "A script that sets up and runs a fine‑tuning job for an instruction‑guided Stable Diffusion model (Instruct‑Pix2Pix) using Megatron‑based latent diffusion editing. It parses Hydra configurations, builds a Megatron trainer, initializes the diffusion edit model, executes the training loop, and manages experiment logging and checkpoints.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to adapt the Instruct‑Pix2Pix diffusion model to custom datasets, creating specialized text‑driven image‑editing capabilities for downstream applications.", "keywords": ["fine-tuning", "Instruct-Pix2Pix", "Stable Diffusion", "Megatron", "latent diffusion", "Hydra", "training loop", "image editing", "diffusion models", "model customization", "experiment tracking"], "summary_hash": "072a5c3cd7ff", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:56:34+00:00"}
