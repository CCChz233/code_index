{"summary": "This module implements the delayed execution API for Dask. It defines a core class that represents a lazily evaluated computation, proxy objects for deferred attribute access and method calls, and leaf nodes that wrap callables. Together they build and manage Dask task graphs, integrate with tokenization, high‑level graph handling, and optimization mechanisms, allowing users to construct complex workflows without immediate execution.", "business_intent": "Provide a user‑friendly way to construct and manage scalable, parallel task graphs by deferring computation until explicitly executed, thereby enabling efficient use of distributed resources and simplifying complex workflow definition.", "keywords": ["delayed", "lazy evaluation", "task graph", "Dask", "high‑level graph", "parallel computing", "deferred execution", "graph optimization", "attribute proxy", "distributed computation"], "summary_hash": "5d0e3abc0330", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:15:48+00:00"}
