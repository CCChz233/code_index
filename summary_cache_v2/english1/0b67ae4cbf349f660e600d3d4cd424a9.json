{"summary": "A decorator that injects an Airflow S3KeySensor into a flow, causing the flow's initial step to pause until the specified S3 objects appear. It operates only with Airflow‑scheduled flows compiled via `airflow create` and supports multiple sensors, each configurable with timeout, polling interval, execution mode, exponential backoff, pool, soft‑fail, naming, description, bucket/key specifications, wildcard matching, AWS connection ID, and SSL verification. Includes validation of parameters.", "business_intent": "Ensure that data pipelines start only after required files are present in S3, preventing downstream failures and synchronizing execution within Airflow‑managed workflows.", "keywords": ["airflow", "s3", "sensor", "decorator", "pipeline", "data availability", "timeout", "polling", "execution mode", "backoff", "pool", "soft fail", "aws connection"], "summary_hash": "79391046f4ef", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:14:21+00:00"}
