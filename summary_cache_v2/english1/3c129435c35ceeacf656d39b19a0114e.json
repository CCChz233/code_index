{"summary": "The module defines a transpiler transformation pass that walks a circuit's DAG representation and removes any operation nodes that fail a user‑provided predicate, yielding a filtered DAG containing only the desired operations.", "business_intent": "To give developers a flexible tool for pruning quantum circuits during transpilation, enabling custom gate selection and simplifying downstream optimization or analysis steps.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "transpiler", "pass", "DAG", "filter", "operation nodes", "predicate", "circuit optimization", "transformation pass", "quantum circuit"], "summary_hash": "c04d7a536a2b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:27:03+00:00"}
