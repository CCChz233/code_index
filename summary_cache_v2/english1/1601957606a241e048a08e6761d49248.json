{"summary": "The module implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using MXNet and DGL, including a multi‑layer GCN model and a single GCN layer that aggregate and transform node features based on graph connectivity. It provides utilities for training and evaluating the model on standard citation graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) with batch processing support, illustrating semi‑supervised node classification.", "business_intent": "Offer a reference implementation for researchers and developers to experiment with semi‑supervised graph neural network models, facilitating rapid prototyping and benchmarking of GCNs on citation network data.", "keywords": ["graph convolutional network", "semi-supervised classification", "MXNet", "DGL", "citation datasets", "batch processing", "node embeddings", "graph neural network"], "summary_hash": "70a0989edaae", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:09:59+00:00"}
