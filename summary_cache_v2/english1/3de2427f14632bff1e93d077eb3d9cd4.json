{"summary": "This module defines the core node types used to represent parse trees, including generic nodes, regex match nodes, and rule‑decorator infrastructure, and provides a visitor framework that traverses these trees in depth‑first order. It also supplies lightweight helpers for creating rule decorators, enabling users to build and walk parse trees while preserving state and handling errors.", "business_intent": "Supply the fundamental data structures and traversal utilities required by the parsing engine so that developers can construct, inspect, and process abstract syntax trees efficiently and safely.", "keywords": ["parse tree", "node", "regex match", "visitor pattern", "depth‑first traversal", "rule decorator", "metaclass", "stateful processing", "symbol table", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "8caf95aa1456", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:42:09+00:00"}
