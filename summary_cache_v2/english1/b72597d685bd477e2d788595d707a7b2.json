{"summary": "The module defines data structures that capture taxonomy information for special particles. It includes a class that assembles pre‑computed sets representing categories such as leptons, baryons, bosons, and antiparticles, exposing them as attributes for fast membership testing. An auxiliary, currently unused, routine exists for constructing particle dictionaries.", "business_intent": "Supply a centralized, ready‑to‑use collection of special‑particle classifications to support plasma‑physics calculations and validation within the Plasmapy ecosystem.", "keywords": ["particle taxonomy", "special particles", "leptons", "baryons", "bosons", "antiparticles", "particle sets", "membership testing", "plasma physics", "data structures", "placeholder helper"], "summary_hash": "5b07e4760e89", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:05:06+00:00"}
