{"summary": "Provides a collection of utilities for managing HTTP caching in Django. It handles generation of cache keys, evaluation of conditional request headers (such as If‑None‑Match and If‑Modified‑Since), setting of ETag and Cache‑Control headers, and manipulation of the Vary header on HttpResponse objects. The helpers can patch responses directly or be used by decorators to ensure proper cache behavior.", "business_intent": "Ensures that Django applications produce correct cache directives and respect client‑side cache validation, allowing caches to vary on specified request headers (e.g., language) and to return appropriate 304 or 412 responses, thereby improving performance and content correctness.", "keywords": ["caching", "HTTP Vary header", "cache key generation", "conditional GET", "ETag", "Cache-Control", "Django response utilities", "response header manipulation"], "summary_hash": "bdca50cfba50", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:20:40+00:00"}
