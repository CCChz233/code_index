{"summary": "This module supplies the core logic for altering the shape and chunk layout of Dask arrays. It includes utilities to contract or expand dimension specifications, compute new chunk boundaries, adjust array metadata, and build the high‑level graph needed to represent a reshaped or rechunked array lazily.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient, out‑of‑core manipulation of large distributed arrays by allowing users to reshape or repartition data without materializing it, thereby supporting scientific computing, data analytics, and machine‑learning workflows that require flexible array dimensions and optimized memory distribution.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "reshape", "rechunk", "chunking", "lazy evaluation", "high‑level graph", "distributed computing", "numpy compatibility", "metadata handling"], "summary_hash": "625d2313dfe1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:17:44+00:00"}
