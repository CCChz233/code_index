{"summary": "A command‑line utility that runs large‑scale, distributed inference with the Florence‑2 vision‑language model. It leverages Accelerate for multi‑GPU coordination, processes image datasets (including WebDataset format), applies the model via HuggingFace Transformers, and writes the generated outputs to disk.", "business_intent": "Enable enterprises and developers to efficiently apply a state‑of‑the‑art image understanding model across massive image collections, reducing inference time and resource overhead for tasks such as captioning, OCR, and visual question answering.", "keywords": ["distributed inference", "Florence-2", "vision-language model", "accelerate", "multi‑GPU", "image processing", "batch inference", "webdataset", "torch", "transformers", "CLI"], "summary_hash": "2f736de9ea8b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:17:26+00:00"}
