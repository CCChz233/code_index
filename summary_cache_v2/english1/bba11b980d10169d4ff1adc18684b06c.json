{"summary": "The module supplies dictionary-oriented wrappers for signal processing transforms, enabling array-level signal operations to be applied to selected keys within data dictionaries. It builds on generic map‑transform infrastructure to manipulate signal fields directly in dictionary structures.", "business_intent": "To simplify and standardize preprocessing of signal data stored in dictionaries for medical imaging workflows, ensuring missing or NaN values are appropriately filled and transforms are consistently applied before model training or inference.", "keywords": ["dictionary transform", "signal preprocessing", "NaN replacement", "missing value handling", "map transform", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "data pipeline"], "summary_hash": "afce96c1e305", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:23:38+00:00"}
