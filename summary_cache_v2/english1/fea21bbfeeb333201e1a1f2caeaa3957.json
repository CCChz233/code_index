{"summary": "Defines a suite of unit tests tailored for the Bit model, verifying its configuration, initialization, forward behavior, attention outputs, backbone functionality, feed‑forward chunking, hidden‑state handling, image‑classification capability, and loading from pretrained weights, while adapting tests to the model's omission of standard inputs such as input_ids, inputs_embeds, attention_mask, and sequence length.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and robustness of the Bit model across core components and use‑cases to ensure reliable integration in downstream applications, especially those involving image classification and custom input handling.", "keywords": ["Bit model", "unit testing", "configuration validation", "model initialization", "attention output verification", "backbone behavior", "feed‑forward chunking", "hidden state output", "image classification test", "pretrained model loading", "custom input handling", "no input_ids", "no attention_mask"], "summary_hash": "01bc40ee4780", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:53:25+00:00"}
