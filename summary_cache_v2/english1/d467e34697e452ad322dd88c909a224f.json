{"summary": "The package provides two example training scripts for a simple convolutional neural network that classifies MNIST digits. One script shows a classic PyTorch implementation limited to single‑GPU or CPU execution, while the other rewrites the same workflow with Lightning Fabric, handling device placement, optimizer and data‑loader setup, and enabling GPU or multi‑GPU training through a streamlined command‑line interface.", "business_intent": "Illustrate how to upgrade a basic PyTorch image classifier to a scalable, distributed training solution using Lightning Fabric, helping developers accelerate model training across different hardware configurations.", "keywords": ["MNIST", "image classification", "PyTorch", "Lightning Fabric", "CNN", "training loop", "GPU", "multi‑GPU", "distributed training", "command‑line interface", "optimizer", "data loader"], "summary_hash": "f4269d76c0b1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:11:59+00:00"}
