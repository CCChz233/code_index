{"summary": "Implements a variational fully‑connected neural network that encodes inputs into a latent distribution, samples via reparameterization, and decodes the sampled latent vectors back to the desired output shape. The architecture is configurable with separate hidden layer sizes for the encoder and decoder, optional dropout, customizable activation functions, and bias handling.", "business_intent": "Provides a compact VAE‑style model for learning latent representations and generating predictions in medical imaging or related domains, enabling reconstruction, synthesis, and uncertainty quantification from low‑dimensional or tabular data.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "fully connected network", "encoder", "decoder", "reparameterization", "latent space", "dropout", "activation function", "bias", "MONAI", "deep learning", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "8d4ac972e480", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:17:15+00:00"}
