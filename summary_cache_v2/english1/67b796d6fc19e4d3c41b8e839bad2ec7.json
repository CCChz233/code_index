{"summary": "The analytical dispersion package supplies a collection of physics‑based models for calculating wave characteristics in magnetized plasmas. It includes implementations for fast magnetosonic (magnetoacoustic) waves, the Stix cold‑plasma dispersion function, and a two‑fluid plasma description, each providing methods to evaluate frequencies, phase and group velocities, dielectric tensor components, and related plasma parameters using unit‑aware quantities.", "business_intent": "Enable plasma scientists, fusion engineers, and space‑physics researchers to quickly obtain accurate wave dispersion properties for design, diagnostics, and theoretical studies without resorting to full numerical simulations.", "keywords": ["plasma dispersion", "analytical models", "magnetohydrodynamics", "fast magnetosonic wave", "Stix cold plasma", "two‑fluid plasma", "wave frequency", "phase velocity", "group velocity", "Alfvén speed", "dielectric tensor"], "summary_hash": "e6e00a96c3e8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:16:11+00:00"}
