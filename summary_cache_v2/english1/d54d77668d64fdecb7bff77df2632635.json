{"summary": "The module acts as the main entry point for a PyTorch training pipeline that employs a Smooth AP loss. It parses command‑line options, prepares datasets and data loaders, constructs the model and associated loss functions, runs the training and validation loops, logs metrics with TensorBoard, and manages checkpointing and multiprocessing for efficient execution.", "business_intent": "Provide a configurable, high‑performance framework for training and evaluating deep learning models with Smooth AP loss, facilitating research and development of image retrieval or similar computer‑vision systems.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "training pipeline", "Smooth AP loss", "data loading", "model evaluation", "TensorBoard", "multiprocessing", "command line interface", "checkpointing", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "4e8d90828655", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:27:29+00:00"}
