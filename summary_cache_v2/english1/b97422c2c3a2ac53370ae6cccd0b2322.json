{"summary": "The module provides a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the nesting setup utilities in the ROMS tools package. It verifies calculations of boundary distances, interpolation index mapping between parent and child grids, child boundary mapping logic, modification of child topography and masks based on parent land, and overall nesting object behavior such as grid compatibility checks, file hash validation, plotting, YAML serialization, and saving mechanisms.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the correctness and robustness of nesting operations used in ocean modeling workflows, ensuring that grid interactions, land‑water boundary handling, and data persistence functions perform reliably across various scenarios.", "keywords": ["testing", "unit tests", "nesting", "grid", "boundary distance", "interpolation indices", "child-parent mapping", "topography modification", "mask adjustment", "ROMs", "ocean modeling", "validation", "serialization", "plotting", "file hash"], "summary_hash": "71aff58802bd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:16:35+00:00"}
