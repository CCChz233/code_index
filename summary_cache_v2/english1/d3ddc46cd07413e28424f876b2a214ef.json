{"summary": "The module provides a collection of pytest functions that assess AWS Kinesis size constraints—specifically the 1 MiB per record and 5 MiB per batch limits—by using moto to mock AWS services. Helper tests generate payloads of exact, smaller, or larger sizes and verify that oversized data triggers appropriate client errors, while some functions are placeholders or currently unused.", "business_intent": "Validate that applications interacting with Kinesis respect AWS-imposed size limits, preventing runtime failures and ensuring reliable data ingestion.", "keywords": ["AWS Kinesis", "size limits", "record size", "batch size", "boto3", "moto", "pytest", "mock AWS", "client error", "testing"], "summary_hash": "a388f1df7874", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:33:13+00:00"}
