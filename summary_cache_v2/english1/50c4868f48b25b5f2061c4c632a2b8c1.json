{"summary": "Implements a dual image‑mask transform that randomly selects a subset of object instances encoded in a single‑channel mask, removes those regions from the image and mask, optionally fills the void with a constant value or inpaints it, and updates or discards related bounding boxes and keypoints based on configurable area and visibility thresholds.", "business_intent": "Enhance computer‑vision training pipelines for segmentation, detection and keypoint tasks by simulating occlusions or missing objects, increasing data diversity and model robustness.", "keywords": ["mask dropout", "data augmentation", "instance removal", "occlusion simulation", "inpainting", "bounding box adjustment", "keypoint update", "segmentation", "object detection", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "a5b1cd308f22", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:29:00+00:00"}
