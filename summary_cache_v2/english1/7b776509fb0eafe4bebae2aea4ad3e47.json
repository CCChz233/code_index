{"summary": "Implements a diffusion‑based image‑to‑image pipeline that takes an input image, encodes it into latent space, combines it with textual prompts encoded by CLIP and T5 models, and iteratively denoises the latents using a conditional transformer and scheduler to produce edited or inpainted images. It manages VAE encoding/decoding, latent packing, prompt embedding, timestep handling, and guidance scaling.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and end‑users to generate or modify images guided by natural‑language descriptions, supporting applications such as creative content creation, visual editing, and AI‑driven design.", "keywords": ["image-to-image generation", "inpainting", "diffusion model", "latent diffusion", "transformer denoiser", "scheduler", "VAE encoder", "CLIP text encoder", "T5 text encoder", "prompt embedding", "guidance scale", "timesteps", "latent preparation"], "summary_hash": "b9c0524ffd6d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:14:30+00:00"}
