{"summary": "Provides a transformation pass that recursively decomposes any gate acting on three or more qubits into a sequence of one‑ and two‑qubit operations, converting the circuit to a DAG, handling control‑flow constructs, and raising errors when a decomposition is unavailable.", "business_intent": "Allows quantum circuits to be compiled for back‑ends that only support up to two‑qubit gates by automatically breaking down larger multi‑qubit operations into hardware‑compatible primitives.", "keywords": ["transpiler", "pass", "gate decomposition", "multi-qubit", "three-qubit", "two-qubit", "one-qubit", "circuit transformation", "quantum compilation", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "b1b89cb8834c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:27:09+00:00"}
