{"summary": "Creates an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit whose gate layout consists of an initial layer of Hadamard gates, a diagonal layer of T‑gate rotations, a set of controlled‑phase (CS) gates determined by the upper‑triangular part of an interaction matrix, and a final layer of Hadamards. The matrix entries directly set the rotation exponents, allowing the circuit to be instantiated from any n × n interaction matrix.", "business_intent": "Enable users to generate standard IQP circuits for research on commuting quantum computations, complexity analysis, and benchmarking of quantum simulators within the Qiskit framework.", "keywords": ["IQP", "quantum circuit", "Hadamard", "T gate", "controlled-phase", "interaction matrix", "Qiskit", "complexity", "simulation", "commuting quantum computation"], "summary_hash": "e5b836df2cf5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:25:40+00:00"}
