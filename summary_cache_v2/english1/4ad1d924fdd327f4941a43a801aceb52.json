{"summary": "The module provides utilities for planning and performing rechunking of Dask arrays. It computes how existing blocks intersect with new chunk boundaries, estimates the size of the resulting task graph, and builds a high‑level graph that reshapes an array into a different chunk layout or block shape.", "business_intent": "Allow users to reconfigure the chunking of large distributed arrays to improve memory utilization, I/O patterns, and parallel execution efficiency within Dask workflows.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "rechunk", "chunk layout", "high‑level graph", "distributed computing", "memory optimization", "parallel processing", "task graph estimation"], "summary_hash": "ffda156fdb7d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:18:06+00:00"}
