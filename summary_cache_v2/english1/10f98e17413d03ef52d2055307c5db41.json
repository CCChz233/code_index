{"summary": "A transformation that extracts a fixed-size patch from an image (and associated masks, bounding boxes, and keypoints). It first tries to locate a region where the mask contains non‑zero (or non‑ignored) pixels and crops around that area; if the mask is empty, missing, or no suitable region is found, it defaults to a random crop. The transform validates crop dimensions, respects ignore values and channels, and updates all targets to reflect the new crop.", "business_intent": "Provide a data‑augmentation step for segmentation and related computer‑vision tasks that preferentially samples image regions containing foreground objects, improving model learning on relevant areas while still allowing random sampling when foreground is absent.", "keywords": ["cropping", "mask‑aware", "segmentation augmentation", "foreground‑focused sampling", "random crop fallback", "ignore value handling", "bounding box adjustment", "keypoint transformation", "image preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "64ac0069d8dd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:28:28+00:00"}
