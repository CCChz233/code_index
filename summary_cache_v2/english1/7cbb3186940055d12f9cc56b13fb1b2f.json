{"summary": "A lightweight container that captures the result of a model closure during training, storing the original loss tensor with its computation graph, a detached copy for safe logging or metric computation, and any additional values returned by the training step. It includes helpers to clone the loss, serialize the contents to a dictionary, and instantiate itself directly from a training_step output.", "business_intent": "Enable the training loop to manage closure outputs efficiently by providing both graph‑attached and detached loss representations while preserving auxiliary data, simplifying loss handling, logging, and downstream processing in Lightning modules.", "keywords": ["closure", "loss", "detached loss", "training_step", "container", "result", "extra data", "asdict", "clone loss", "post init"], "summary_hash": "70c372cada50", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:24:33+00:00"}
