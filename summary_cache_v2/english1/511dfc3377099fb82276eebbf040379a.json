{"summary": "The module defines the Lake package API for MODFLOW‑6, providing classes that encapsulate lake characteristics, groundwater‑lake connections, and various outlet formulations (Manning, specified flow, weir). It includes utilities to assemble connection and outlet tables, manage time‑varying series, and render the required input files via Jinja templates.", "business_intent": "Allow groundwater modelers to integrate lake systems into MODFLOW‑6 simulations by programmatically constructing lake definitions, linking them to model cells, specifying outlet behavior, and generating the corresponding package input files.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW", "lake package", "groundwater modeling", "hydraulic connections", "outlet types", "time series", "Jinja template rendering", "simulation input generation", "hydrology"], "summary_hash": "9c3fec3fbcd2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:48:12+00:00"}
