{"summary": "The class serves as a preprocessing component that walks through parsed structures, extracts raw text, normalizes escaped characters, and converts function argument values into appropriate native types. It also handles function declaration nodes and state identifiers, preparing a clean, typed representation for downstream logic.", "business_intent": "To convert raw parsed input into a normalized, type‑safe model that can be used for building or executing state‑based workflows or function calls.", "keywords": ["preprocessing", "AST visitor", "type conversion", "escaped character handling", "function argument extraction", "state name processing", "text normalization", "parsing utilities"], "summary_hash": "24f714c492e4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:22:48+00:00"}
