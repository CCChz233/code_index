{"summary": "The module provides a set of dataset wrappers that load audio‑text pairs from HuggingFace collections and prepare them for NeMo automatic speech recognition models. It supports both map‑style and iterable datasets, handling audio augmentation, channel selection, silence trimming, RMS normalization, and text processing including language‑specific cleaning, whitelist filtering, and insertion of BOS/EOS/PAD token IDs for either byte‑pair‑encoding or character tokenizations.", "business_intent": "Simplify integration of HuggingFace speech corpora into NeMo training pipelines, allowing users to quickly create ready‑to‑train ASR datasets with minimal code while supporting various tokenization strategies and distributed training.", "keywords": ["huggingface", "dataset", "audio", "speech recognition", "preprocessing", "augmentation", "tokenization", "BPE", "character", "iterable", "NeMo", "ASR", "collate", "normalization", "distributed"], "summary_hash": "8bdece438736", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:07:19+00:00"}
