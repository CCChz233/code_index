{"summary": "A high-level pipeline that orchestrates a multilingual text encoder, tokenizers, a prior transformer, a conditional UNet, and a VQ‑decoder to perform image‑to‑image generation using the Kandinsky diffusion model. It extracts text and image embeddings, runs a diffusion process conditioned on these embeddings, and decodes the resulting latents into images. The pipeline also manages device placement, memory‑efficient attention, and progress monitoring.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to quickly generate new images conditioned on existing images and textual prompts, supporting creative prototyping, artistic exploration, and marketing material creation.", "keywords": ["image-to-image generation", "diffusion model", "Kandinsky", "multilingual text encoder", "prior transformer", "conditional UNet", "VQ decoder", "scheduler", "tokenizer", "pipeline", "memory-efficient attention", "progress monitoring"], "summary_hash": "4fff6e5b1fab", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:26:11+00:00"}
