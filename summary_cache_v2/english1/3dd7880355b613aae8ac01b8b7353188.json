{"summary": "The module defines an evaluator that measures the binary classification accuracy of CrossEncoder models. It processes input examples, obtains a single prediction score per example, converts scores to class labels using a configurable threshold, compares them with ground‑truth labels, and reports the overall accuracy. The evaluator also supports logging results and optionally writing detailed scores to a CSV file.", "business_intent": "To provide a reliable way to validate and compare the performance of binary sentence‑pair classification models, facilitating model selection, monitoring, and quality assurance in NLP applications such as entailment detection, sentiment analysis, or duplicate detection.", "keywords": ["cross-encoder", "binary classification", "accuracy evaluation", "thresholding", "model assessment", "NLP", "sentence_transformers", "evaluation metrics", "CSV logging"], "summary_hash": "303ccdcfbbdb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:56:39+00:00"}
