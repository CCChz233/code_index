{"summary": "CuGraphRelGraphConv provides a GPU‑only implementation of a relational graph convolution layer, using cuGraph‑ops for high‑performance aggregation. It follows the RelGraphConv formulation, supports basis‑decomposition regularization, optional bias, activation, self‑loops, dropout and layer‑norm, and transforms node features based on edge type indices.", "business_intent": "Deliver fast, scalable training and inference of relational graph neural networks on large heterogeneous graphs by exploiting NVIDIA cuGraph‑ops acceleration on CUDA devices.", "keywords": ["relational graph convolution", "GPU acceleration", "cuGraph", "basis decomposition", "regularization", "self loop", "dropout", "layer normalization", "heterogeneous graph", "message passing", "CUDA", "graph neural network", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "36c828b7ac9c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:56:50+00:00"}
