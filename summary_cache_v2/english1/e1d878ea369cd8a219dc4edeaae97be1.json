{"summary": "This module defines parameterized unit tests for the Terraform connection‑existence solver. It sets up test graphs, runs the solver, and asserts that connections, data and output paths, and graph reductions are correctly identified for various target types across supported graph frameworks.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness of the connection discovery logic used in Terraform infrastructure security checks, ensuring reliable detection of resource relationships in different graph implementations.", "keywords": ["Terraform", "graph", "connection solver", "unit testing", "parameterized", "infrastructure security", "resource connections", "graph frameworks", "test automation"], "summary_hash": "83b973e71da3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:21:18+00:00"}
