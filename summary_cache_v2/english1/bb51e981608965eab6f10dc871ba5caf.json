{"summary": "The module defines a collection of custom activation layers for PyTorch models, offering efficient approximations, mixed‑precision handling, and gated variants that combine linear projections with GELU or SiLU gating. It also provides a utility to retrieve an activation module by name, supporting flexible model construction across different hardware backends.", "business_intent": "Supply optimized and versatile activation components to accelerate training and inference of diffusion and other deep learning models, ensuring numerical stability and hardware compatibility while allowing developers to easily select or replace activation functions.", "keywords": ["activation", "GELU", "SiLU", "Swish", "GEGLU", "SwiGLU", "gated linear unit", "approximation", "mixed precision", "PyTorch", "diffusion models", "neural network layers", "hardware acceleration"], "summary_hash": "4c85deb92783", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:15:38+00:00"}
