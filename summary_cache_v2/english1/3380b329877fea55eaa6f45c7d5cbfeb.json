{"summary": "The module defines a set of structured data models and containers for representing evaluation samples, datasets, and results in Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. It includes abstract and concrete sample definitions for single‑turn and multi‑turn dialogues, utilities for converting samples to message objects, validating inputs, and serializing to dictionaries or common file formats. Dataset classes manage collections of samples, enforce type consistency, and expose metadata and conversion helpers. An evaluation result class aggregates scores, reference data, and cost/token usage, offering DataFrame conversion and aggregation methods.", "business_intent": "Enable systematic, reproducible evaluation of RAG and conversational AI systems by providing standardized schemas, dataset handling, and result aggregation tools that simplify data preparation, metric computation, cost analysis, and downstream reporting.", "keywords": ["RAG", "evaluation", "dataset", "schema", "sample", "single-turn", "multi-turn", "pandas", "cost aggregation", "token usage", "serialization", "validation", "pydantic", "messages"], "summary_hash": "c338bd11889f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:48:38+00:00"}
