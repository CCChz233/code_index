{"summary": "Encapsulates multiple descriptor matching strategies (nearest‑neighbor, symmetric NN, mutual NN, symmetric mutual NN) into a single module, letting users choose the matching mode and set a distance‑ratio threshold, and provides a forward operation that applies the selected matcher to descriptor tensors.", "business_intent": "Provides a flexible, reusable component for extracting feature correspondences in computer‑vision pipelines—such as image registration, stitching, and object recognition—by offering configurable descriptor matching that can be integrated into deep‑learning workflows.", "keywords": ["descriptor matching", "nearest neighbor", "symmetric nearest neighbor", "mutual nearest neighbor", "threshold", "feature correspondence", "computer vision", "kornia", "matching mode", "deep learning integration"], "summary_hash": "adb575259af5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:41:22+00:00"}
