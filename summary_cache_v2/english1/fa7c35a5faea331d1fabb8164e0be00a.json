{"summary": "The module implements the climate component for Home Assistant, defining a generic climate device entity with asynchronous and synchronous methods to read status and control heating, cooling, fan, humidity, swing and auxiliary features. It registers a set of services for adjusting these parameters, provides setup and unload logic, and declares constants for attributes, states, and supported capabilities.", "business_intent": "Allow Home Assistant users to integrate, monitor and control HVAC and thermostat devices through a standardized interface, enabling automation and user interaction for temperature regulation, mode selection, fan operation, humidity management, and related climate functions.", "keywords": ["climate", "HVAC", "thermostat", "temperature control", "Home Assistant", "entity", "service", "heating", "cooling", "fan mode", "humidity", "swing mode", "auxiliary heat", "away mode", "operation mode", "async", "integration"], "summary_hash": "651eeda90757", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:50:55+00:00"}
