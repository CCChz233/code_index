{"summary": "A transform that scans a segmentation mask and fills background pixels that are completely surrounded by a single class label, effectively removing interior holes and small artifacts. It supports single‑channel or one‑hot encoded multi‑channel tensors/arrays, allows connectivity configuration, and can be limited to specific labels for faster execution.", "business_intent": "Improve the quality of labeled images by automatically correcting missing or spurious regions, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as model training, quantitative analysis, or visual inspection.", "keywords": ["hole filling", "segmentation mask", "artifact removal", "connectivity", "background label", "one‑hot encoding", "PyTorch", "numpy", "image preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "29d6fc2bc979", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:00:54+00:00"}
