{"summary": "Implements a greedy decoding pipeline that converts input token IDs into embeddings, passes them through a decoder to obtain hidden states, applies log‑softmax to generate token log‑probabilities, and iteratively selects the highest‑probability token until an end‑of‑sequence token or a maximum length is reached.", "business_intent": "Provide fast, deterministic token sequence generation for tasks like language modeling, speech recognition, or machine translation where greedy decoding is sufficient.", "keywords": ["greedy decoding", "sequence generation", "embedding", "decoder", "log_softmax", "token probabilities", "padding token", "BOS token", "EOS token", "max sequence length", "batch processing", "model freezing"], "summary_hash": "8128089bf4e8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:17:30+00:00"}
