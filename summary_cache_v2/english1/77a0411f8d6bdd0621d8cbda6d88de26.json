{"summary": "Implements the core binary I/O routines for Qiskit's QPY format, handling the encoding and decoding of quantum circuits, pulse schedules, and associated value objects. The module provides low‑level helpers to translate circuit metadata, registers, instructions, parameters, layouts, calibrations, custom operations, control‑flow constructs, schedule blocks, channels, waveforms, kernels, discriminators, symbolic expressions, and alignment contexts to and from a compact binary representation.", "business_intent": "Facilitate fast, compact storage and reliable transmission of Qiskit quantum objects across processes or between machines, enabling reproducible reconstruction of circuits and pulse programs for simulation, execution, and archival purposes.", "keywords": ["QPY", "binary serialization", "deserialization", "quantum circuit", "pulse schedule", "value objects", "Qiskit", "data persistence", "compact storage", "transport"], "summary_hash": "583ecf906e64", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:06:41+00:00"}
