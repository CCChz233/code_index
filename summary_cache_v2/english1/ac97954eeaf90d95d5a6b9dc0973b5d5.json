{"summary": "This module implements utilities for reading raw byte data from various file systems. It parses human‑readable byte specifications, opens files via fsspec, handles optional compression, and extracts specific byte ranges using low‑level block reads. The functions are integrated with Dask's delayed execution model and tokenization to enable lazy, reproducible data access across distributed environments.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient, flexible, and lazy retrieval of byte slices from local or remote storage, supporting compression handling and Dask's parallel computation framework.", "keywords": ["bytes", "file I/O", "fsspec", "compression", "byte range", "delayed execution", "tokenization", "distributed computing"], "summary_hash": "ba64b8883505", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:18:39+00:00"}
