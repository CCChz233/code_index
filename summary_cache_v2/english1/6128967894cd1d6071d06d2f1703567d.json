{"summary": "A command‑line script that constructs, trains, and evaluates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on standard citation graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) using DGL and PyTorch. It manages data loading, optional self‑loop augmentation, model creation, optimizer configuration, the training loop, and periodic accuracy assessment.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run example that demonstrates how to implement and benchmark GCN‑based node classification with DGL, helping developers and researchers quickly reproduce results from the original GCN paper and use the code as a baseline for further graph neural network experiments.", "keywords": ["GCN", "graph convolutional network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "citation networks", "node classification", "training script", "self‑loop", "optimizer", "evaluation", "Cora", "Citeseer", "Pubmed"], "summary_hash": "5ab77c039c85", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:54:25+00:00"}
