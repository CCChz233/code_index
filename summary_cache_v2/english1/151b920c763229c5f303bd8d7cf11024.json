{"summary": "The module implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using DGL's sparse tensor support to perform semi‑supervised node classification on the Cora citation graph. It defines the GCN model architecture, loads the dataset, and provides utilities for training the model and measuring its accuracy.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate how to build and train a sparse GCN for graph‑based classification tasks, serving as a reference implementation for developers integrating graph neural networks into analytics or recommendation pipelines.", "keywords": ["graph convolutional network", "GCN", "semi-supervised classification", "node classification", "Cora dataset", "DGL", "sparse tensors", "PyTorch", "graph neural network", "training loop", "evaluation"], "summary_hash": "0d1d1d600107", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:09:11+00:00"}
