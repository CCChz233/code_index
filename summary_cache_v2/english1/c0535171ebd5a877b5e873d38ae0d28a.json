{"summary": "Provides a command‑line tool that performs efficient, chunk‑based inference with RNNT speech‑to‑text models on long audio recordings. The audio is split into configurable segments, context buffers are added, each chunk is decoded, and the partial results are merged using either a middle‑token or longest‑common‑subsequence strategy. The final transcriptions and optional word‑error‑rate metrics are written to an output file.", "business_intent": "Facilitates scalable and accurate transcription of lengthy audio streams for services such as automated captioning, voice analytics, and content indexing by leveraging RNNT models with buffered, chunked processing.", "keywords": ["speech-to-text", "RNNT", "chunked inference", "buffered decoding", "long audio", "transcription", "word error rate", "command-line", "batch processing", "context buffering", "hypothesis merging", "middle-token", "longest common subsequence"], "summary_hash": "0016a3752d09", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:58:00+00:00"}
