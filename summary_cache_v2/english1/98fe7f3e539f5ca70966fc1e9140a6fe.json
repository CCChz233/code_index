{"summary": "This module implements the conversion layer that translates OpenAI‑style embedding requests and responses into the format required by Cohere's embed endpoint. It encapsulates configuration handling, request construction, response parsing, usage accounting, and model version detection, allowing the rest of the system to interact with Cohere embeddings through a unified OpenAI‑compatible interface.", "business_intent": "Provide seamless support for Cohere embedding models within the Litellm platform by abstracting API differences, enabling developers to use a consistent OpenAI‑like embedding API while accurately tracking usage and handling model-specific nuances.", "keywords": ["embedding", "API transformation", "OpenAI compatibility", "Cohere integration", "request conversion", "response parsing", "usage accounting", "model version detection", "Litellm"], "summary_hash": "0029020ad35a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:59:50+00:00"}
