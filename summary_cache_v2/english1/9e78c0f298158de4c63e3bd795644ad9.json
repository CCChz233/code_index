{"summary": "The basic provider module implements a lightweight Qiskit provider that registers simple simulator backends, manages simulation jobs, supplies low‑level linear‑algebra utilities for gate construction and tensor operations, and defines a reference statevector simulator with execution, measurement and reset capabilities, together with a custom exception hierarchy.", "business_intent": "To give Qiskit users a fast, easy‑to‑use simulation environment for testing, debugging and educational purposes, allowing quick execution of quantum circuits without the overhead of full‑scale simulators.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "provider", "simulator", "statevector", "job management", "backend", "linear algebra", "gate matrices", "tensor contraction", "exception handling", "quantum circuit testing"], "summary_hash": "1103cec29c2d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:09:42+00:00"}
