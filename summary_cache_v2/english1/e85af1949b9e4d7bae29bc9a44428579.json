{"summary": "This test suite verifies the end‑to‑end functionality of several image‑processing workflows in the Fractal framework, including conversion of CellVoyager and Yokogawa datasets to OME‑Zarr, generation of maximum‑intensity projections, illumination correction, and handling of edge cases such as missing images or exclusion patterns. The tests also check schema validation and proper error handling during Zarr creation.", "business_intent": "Guarantee reliable, standards‑compliant image conversion and analysis pipelines for biomedical research, reducing data‑handling errors and supporting reproducible downstream analyses.", "keywords": ["testing", "image conversion", "OME-Zarr", "CellVoyager", "Yokogawa", "illumination correction", "projection", "MIP", "schema validation", "Fractal", "biomedical imaging"], "summary_hash": "92a981d32d62", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:58:30+00:00"}
