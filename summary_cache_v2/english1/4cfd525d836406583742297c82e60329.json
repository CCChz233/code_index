{"summary": "The module defines the core data structures and base class for health‑system interaction (HSI) events in the TLO simulation. It models facility attributes, generic event metadata, queue items with sortable fields, wrappers that respect the simulation mode, and a base event class that validates resources, assesses probabilities, and provides hooks for concrete event implementations.", "business_intent": "Enable realistic modeling of health‑system activities—such as patient encounters, resource consumption, and service delivery—by providing a standardized event framework that can be scheduled, validated, and executed within a population health simulation.", "keywords": ["health system interaction", "simulation", "event scheduling", "resource validation", "facility information", "probability assessment", "population health model", "TLO", "event queue", "health services"], "summary_hash": "f04f25b1cb5b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:48:22+00:00"}
