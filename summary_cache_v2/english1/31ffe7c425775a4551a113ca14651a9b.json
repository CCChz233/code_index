{"summary": "A suite of no‑operation (noop) plugin modules that implement the Raster Vision interfaces for augmentors, backends, evaluators, filesystems, label sources and stores, raster sources and transformers, runners, tasks, and utility callables. Each module supplies a dummy implementation, corresponding configuration and builder classes, and a registration helper, allowing the framework to load and use these components without performing any real computation or I/O.", "business_intent": "Provide lightweight placeholder plugins for testing, development, and integration scenarios where full implementations are unnecessary, enabling pipelines to be assembled and executed while avoiding side effects or external dependencies.", "keywords": ["raster vision", "plugin", "noop", "dummy", "placeholder", "testing", "stub", "augmentation", "backend", "evaluator", "filesystem", "label source", "label store", "raster source", "raster transformer", "runner", "task", "configuration", "builder", "registration"], "summary_hash": "744c01a1d4ed", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:03:13+00:00"}
