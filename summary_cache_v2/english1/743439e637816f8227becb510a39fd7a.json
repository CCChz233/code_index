It gathers the scenario outputs, calculates differences in key health indicators such as DALYs, deaths and service utilisation, and creates bar‑type visualisations with confidence intervals to illustrate each treatment's contribution for an overview paper.", "business_intent": "Deliver evidence on the relative impact of each treatment to support scientific reporting and guide health‑policy decisions about resource allocation and treatment prioritisation.", "keywords": ["health system modeling", "treatment impact assessment", "scenario analysis", "DALY reduction", "mortality difference", "service utilisation", "confidence interval visualization", "bar chart reporting", "policy decision support", "capacity constraints"], "summary_hash": "1f7180eb3fdd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:04:19+00:00"}
