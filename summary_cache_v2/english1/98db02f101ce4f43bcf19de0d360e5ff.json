{"summary": "A training script that implements the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm using PyTorch, accelerated and orchestrated with Lightning Fabric for distributed multi‑GPU execution. It sets up the meta‑learning loop, handles task sampling, inner‑loop adaptation, and outer‑loop optimization, while providing utilities for evaluating adaptation performance.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and engineers to efficiently train and evaluate few‑shot meta‑learning models at scale, leveraging Lightning Fabric’s distributed capabilities to reduce training time and simplify deployment on multi‑GPU environments.", "keywords": ["MAML", "meta-learning", "few-shot learning", "Lightning Fabric", "distributed training", "PyTorch", "learn2learn", "cherry-rl", "GPU acceleration", "model adaptation"], "summary_hash": "9dcfa29c5ff8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:51:01+00:00"}
