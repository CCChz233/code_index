{"summary": "This test module validates the behavior of Lhotse‑based data loaders when used in a multi‑rank (distributed) setting. It creates dummy manifests, writes them to JSONL or tar files, and then checks whether the data loader produces deterministic results across ranks when a fixed random seed is supplied, and whether nondeterministic behavior occurs when using a torch random generator.", "business_intent": "Ensure reproducible data loading across distributed training processes for speech/audio pipelines built with Lhotse and NeMo, preventing nondeterministic bugs that could affect model training consistency.", "keywords": ["Lhotse", "NeMo", "distributed training", "multi‑rank", "deterministic RNG", "random seed", "data loader", "CutSet", "JSONL", "TarWriter", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "1de19276fae3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:27:24+00:00"}
