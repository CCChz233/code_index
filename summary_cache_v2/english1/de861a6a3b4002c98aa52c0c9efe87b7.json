{"summary": "Provides helper utilities for handling quantum circuits whose coupling maps consist of multiple disconnected subgraphs. Functions enable separating a circuit DAG into independent components, managing barriers across those components, mapping logical qubits to physical qubits within each isolated subgraph, and executing layout passes on each component while preserving isolation constraints.", "business_intent": "Facilitate efficient transpilation of quantum circuits with disjoint connectivity by allowing layout and routing optimizations to be applied independently to each connected component, thereby improving compilation performance and correctness for hardware with fragmented coupling maps.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "transpiler", "layout", "disconnected components", "coupling map", "DAG", "barrier handling", "graph isolation", "pass execution", "component mapping"], "summary_hash": "e5a807e49c90", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:28:51+00:00"}
