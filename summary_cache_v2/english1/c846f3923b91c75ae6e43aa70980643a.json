{"summary": "Implements a quantum circuit that applies an X, Y, or Z rotation whose angle is determined by evaluating a polynomial on the integer value stored in a set of qubits. The circuit builds the polynomial using arithmetic primitives, then uses the resulting value to control a Pauli rotation, allowing arbitrary polynomial‑controlled phase or amplitude modulation.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable component for quantum algorithms that need to encode smooth, polynomial‑based functions of classical data into quantum amplitudes or phases, supporting tasks such as function approximation, amplitude encoding, quantum machine learning, and Hamiltonian simulation.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "polynomial function", "Pauli rotation", "controlled rotation", "Qiskit", "arithmetic primitives", "function approximation", "quantum algorithm"], "summary_hash": "03d18e45367b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:07:29+00:00"}
