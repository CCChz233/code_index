{"summary": "A reference script that demonstrates how to fine‑tune a ControlNet model for Stable Diffusion XL using the Accelerate library. It parses command‑line options, loads and preprocesses a training dataset, prepares the diffusion models and optimizer, runs a training loop with checkpointing and optional validation, and saves the resulting model and its metadata to a Hugging Face repository.", "business_intent": "Help developers and researchers quickly set up and execute custom ControlNet training pipelines for image generation, enabling them to create specialized diffusion models and share them on the Hugging Face Hub.", "keywords": ["ControlNet", "Stable Diffusion XL", "model fine‑tuning", "accelerate", "diffusion training", "dataset preprocessing", "checkpointing", "validation", "model card", "Hugging Face"], "summary_hash": "496559e6eb1e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:57:40+00:00"}
