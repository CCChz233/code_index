{"summary": "The module defines a protocol for objects that expose dimensionality information (axes count, shape tuple, element count) and a mixin that supplies standard shape properties and representation for any object storing a _shape attribute. It also includes lightweight utilities for converting inputs to shape tuples and flattening shape specifications.", "business_intent": "Enable Qiskit primitives to work uniformly with array-like data structures by providing a common interface and reusable shape handling logic, facilitating static type checking, runtime validation, and consistent representation of multidimensional data.", "keywords": ["shape", "array", "protocol", "mixin", "dimensionality", "numpy", "typing", "utility", "qiskit primitives"], "summary_hash": "9268e8f3f604", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:22:34+00:00"}
