{"summary": "This module defines the core model abstraction used in the Lightning framework. It extends a standard neural network module with built‑in support for forward execution, training/validation/testing steps, optimizer and learning‑rate scheduler configuration, gradient handling, logging, checkpointing, device and mesh management, and a rich set of hooks for custom behavior. It also provides a lightweight proxy that forwards trainer attribute accesses to a Fabric instance, ensuring compatibility with the trainer interface while delegating functionality to Fabric.", "business_intent": "To streamline deep‑learning model development by offering a high‑level, feature‑rich API that abstracts away boilerplate training logic, enables easy logging and checkpointing, and supports scalable, distributed training across various hardware configurations.", "keywords": ["LightningModule", "PyTorch", "model abstraction", "training loop", "validation", "testing", "optimizer configuration", "learning rate scheduler", "gradient handling", "logging", "checkpointing", "device management", "distributed training", "Fabric integration", "hooks", "callbacks"], "summary_hash": "ba0cea166f48", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:58:14+00:00"}
