{"summary": "The module generates a textual representation of directed acyclic graphs. It defines a two‑dimensional character canvas for drawing, a helper for vertex dimensions, and uses a Sugiyama layout algorithm together with edge routing to compose an ASCII diagram of the graph.", "business_intent": "Provide a lightweight, console‑friendly way to visualise DAG structures without graphical dependencies, useful for logging, documentation, or debugging in terminal environments.", "keywords": ["ASCII", "graph visualization", "DAG", "text rendering", "Sugiyama layout", "edge routing", "command line", "console output", "grandalf"], "summary_hash": "d513baf37d71", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:10:10+00:00"}
