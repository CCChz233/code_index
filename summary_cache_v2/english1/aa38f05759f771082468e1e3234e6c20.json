{"summary": "A configuration container for X-MOD transformer models that stores all architectural hyperparameters and options such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of layers and heads, activation functions, dropout rates, position‑embedding type, decoder mode, caching, classifier dropout, adapter settings, and supported languages. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate an XmodModel with the desired structure and behavior.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to specify, customize, and reproduce the exact architecture and multilingual settings of an X-MOD model before model creation, facilitating model initialization, fine‑tuning, and deployment with consistent hyperparameter control.", "keywords": ["X-MOD", "configuration", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "dropout", "position embeddings", "decoder", "cache", "adapters", "multilingual", "language codes", "pretrained config"], "summary_hash": "a08b433776d9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:44:18+00:00"}
