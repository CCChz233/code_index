{"summary": "Implements a compact Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) graph convolution layer together with supporting utilities such as a multi‑layer perceptron and helper functions for various neighborhood aggregations and scaling strategies. The module provides a simple wrapper to integrate the PNA component into larger models and leverages DGL and PyTorch for efficient graph‑based computation.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the development of graph neural network models—particularly for molecular property prediction and other graph‑structured data tasks—by supplying a ready‑to‑use PNA convolution implementation that captures diverse neighborhood statistics and adaptive scaling.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "PNA", "aggregation", "scaling", "MLP", "DGL", "PyTorch", "molecular property prediction", "graph encoder", "node feature update"], "summary_hash": "d6c2f215fa39", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:01:07+00:00"}
