{"summary": "Implements a SPADE‑based generative network that transforms semantic label maps into photorealistic images, optionally conditioned on a latent style vector when used as a VAE decoder. The model builds a hierarchy of up‑sampling blocks with spatially‑adaptive normalization, configurable convolutional parameters, and final activation.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible component for conditional image synthesis in applications such as virtual content creation, data augmentation, or style‑controlled rendering based on semantic layouts.", "keywords": ["SPADE", "semantic image synthesis", "spatially-adaptive normalization", "conditional generation", "VAE decoder", "latent style vector", "upsampling", "convolutional network"], "summary_hash": "70743ff586bc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:32:45+00:00"}
