{"summary": "The module implements a discrimination‑net based engine for matching and rewriting Dask task graphs. It defines structures for nodes, rewrite rules, rule collections, tokens, and a traverser that walks task hierarchies, together with utilities for applying pattern‑replacement transformations in a bottom‑up fashion.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible mechanism to transform Dask computational graphs by specifying pattern‑to‑replacement rules, enabling optimizations, simplifications, or custom graph rewrites before execution.", "keywords": ["Dask", "task graph", "pattern matching", "graph rewrite", "optimization", "discrimination net", "rule set", "graph traversal", "transformation"], "summary_hash": "5e059c3514a6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:15:24+00:00"}
