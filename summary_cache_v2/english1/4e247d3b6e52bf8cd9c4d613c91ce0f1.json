{"summary": "This module implements a collection of alternative attention mechanisms tailored for diffusion‑based transformer models. It provides custom QKV attention layers that handle non‑standard tensor ordering, numerically stable variants, and masked versions, along with a self‑attention pooling layer for aggregating frame‑level features. The core operations are realized through custom autograd functions that ensure stable forward and backward passes on GPU.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient, numerically stable attention computations within NVIDIA NeMo's Imagen diffusion pipelines, improving training and inference performance for large‑scale image generation models.", "keywords": ["attention", "scaled dot‑product", "QKV", "masked attention", "stable attention", "self‑attention pooling", "diffusion models", "transformer", "custom autograd", "GPU", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "3d2488a3c43d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:04:13+00:00"}
