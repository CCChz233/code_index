{"summary": "The module defines structured data containers for representing a single turn in a schema‑guided dialogue and for assembling training or inference examples for NLU models. It includes a descriptor for turn‑level information (utterances, system actions, intent/slot annotations) and a concrete example class that holds utterance text, intents, categorical and non‑categorical slots, requested slots, and feature vectors, together with utilities for adding components, shallow copying, and generating readable descriptions.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to prepare and manage dialogue data for training and evaluating schema‑guided natural language understanding components in conversational AI systems.", "keywords": ["dialogue turn", "NLU training", "schema‑guided", "intent annotation", "slot annotation", "utterance features", "data preparation", "conversational AI", "example representation"], "summary_hash": "d7cae2ba01bd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:10:34+00:00"}
