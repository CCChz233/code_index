{"summary": "This module orchestrates the shuffling and redistribution of graph data for distributed graph partitioning. It reads a dataset, prepares local node and edge subsets, exchanges edge information and feature tensors across machines using collective communication primitives, assigns global identifiers, constructs DGL graph objects for each partition, and writes the resulting partitions and accompanying metadata to storage.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable training of graph neural networks by preprocessing large graphs into distributed partitions that can be efficiently loaded and processed across multiple compute nodes.", "keywords": ["graph", "partitioning", "distributed", "shuffle", "DGL", "edge exchange", "feature exchange", "global IDs", "metadata", "torch.distributed", "gloo"], "summary_hash": "e0c8a94e8070", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:59:12+00:00"}
