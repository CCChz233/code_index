{"summary": "Implements a high‑performance tokenizer for the LXMERT model using the HuggingFace tokenizers library and WordPiece subword segmentation. It loads a vocabulary file, applies optional lower‑casing, accent stripping, text cleaning, and Chinese character handling, and manages special tokens such as CLS, SEP, PAD, MASK and unknown tokens. The tokenizer also generates token type IDs and assembles sequences with the required special tokens, and can persist its vocabulary.", "business_intent": "Enable fast and reliable preprocessing of textual inputs for LXMERT‑based vision‑language applications, supporting efficient batch tokenization and compatibility with the model’s expected token format.", "keywords": ["LXMERT", "fast tokenizer", "WordPiece", "vocabulary", "special tokens", "text preprocessing", "lowercasing", "accent stripping", "Chinese character tokenization"], "summary_hash": "8bd495b498b4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:26:35+00:00"}
