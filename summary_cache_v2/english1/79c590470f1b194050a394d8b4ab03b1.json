{"summary": "This module defines the core infrastructure for Metaflow’s decorator system. It provides abstract base classes for flow‑level and step‑level decorators, handles parsing of decorator specifications, registers and validates decorator usage, and raises detailed errors for duplicate or unknown decorators. Utility helpers attach decorators to flow and step objects and expose simple factory functions for creating decorators.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to extend and customize Metaflow workflows by declaring reusable decorators that modify flow and step behavior, while ensuring correct registration, conflict detection, and lifecycle integration.", "keywords": ["decorator", "flow", "step", "Metaflow", "registration", "validation", "plugin", "configuration", "lifecycle hooks", "error handling", "duplicate detection", "extensibility"], "summary_hash": "311101b28a08", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:57:54+00:00"}
