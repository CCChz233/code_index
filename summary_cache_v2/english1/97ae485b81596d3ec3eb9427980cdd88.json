{"summary": "A pipeline that combines a Stable Diffusion model with one or more ControlNet modules to generate images from textual prompts while applying additional conditioning signals (e.g., depth maps, edge maps). It handles encoding of text and images, preparation of latent representations, guidance scaling, denoising scheduling, safety checking, and integrates utilities for loading embeddings, LoRA weights, and IP adapters.", "business_intent": "Provide developers, artists, and content creators with a flexible tool to produce high‑quality, controllable AI‑generated images for media production, advertising, design, and other creative workflows while ensuring safety and extensibility.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "controlnet", "text-to-image", "diffusion pipeline", "image generation", "conditioning", "safety checker", "latent encoding", "guidance scaling", "scheduler", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "IP adapter", "creative AI"], "summary_hash": "6872ceb1b09e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:17:19+00:00"}
