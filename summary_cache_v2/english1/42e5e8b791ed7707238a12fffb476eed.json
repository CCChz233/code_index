{"summary": "This module implements the core numerical machinery for sampling diffusion models in text‑to‑image generation. It provides utilities for constructing noise trajectories via batched Brownian trees, defines discrete and continuous noise schedules, and offers a suite of solvers—including Euler, Heun, and higher‑order DPMSolver variants—with optional adaptive step‑size control based on PID feedback. The components work together to translate model predictions into image samples through stochastic differential equation integration.", "business_intent": "To supply a flexible, high‑performance sampling backend that powers text‑to‑image diffusion pipelines, enabling fast and accurate image generation by leveraging advanced SDE/ODE solvers and customizable noise schedules.", "keywords": ["diffusion sampling", "stochastic differential equation", "Brownian motion", "noise schedule", "adaptive step size", "PID controller", "DPMSolver", "Euler integration", "Heun method", "image synthesis"], "summary_hash": "069dae66b50d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:07:09+00:00"}
