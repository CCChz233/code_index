{"summary": "BaseSamplerV1 serves as the foundational component for generating quasi‑probability distributions of measurement bitstrings from quantum circuits. It manages the preparation of circuit parameters, dispatches execution jobs, and provides access to results containing probability data and optional metadata.", "business_intent": "Enable users of the quantum computing framework to obtain sampling outcomes (probabilities or quasi‑probabilities) from both fixed and parameterized circuits through a standardized job‑based workflow.", "keywords": ["sampler", "quantum circuits", "quasi‑probabilities", "parameter binding", "job execution", "result handling", "probability distribution", "Qiskit", "quantum primitive"], "summary_hash": "81c272f11143", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:39:51+00:00"}
