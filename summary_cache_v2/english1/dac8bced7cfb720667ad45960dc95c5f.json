{"summary": "The script implements a full pipeline for link prediction on the OGBL dataset using the SEAL framework. It loads the dataset, extracts and labels subgraphs around candidate edges with a double‑radius sampler, defines a dynamic graph convolutional neural network (DGCNN) to embed subgraphs, trains the model with binary cross‑entropy loss, and evaluates performance using Hits@K and MRR metrics.", "business_intent": "Provide a reproducible benchmark and reference implementation for graph link prediction research, showcasing how subgraph extraction, node labeling, and dynamic graph convolutions can be combined to achieve state‑of‑the‑art results on large-scale OGB datasets.", "keywords": ["OGB", "link prediction", "SEAL", "DGCNN", "graph neural network", "subgraph sampling", "double‑radius node labeling", "PyTorch", "DGL", "Hits@K", "MRR"], "summary_hash": "3858dc5bf94b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:29:43+00:00"}
