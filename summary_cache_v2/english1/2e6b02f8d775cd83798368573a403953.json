{"summary": "A neural network class that implements a hierarchical Matryoshka Transformer architecture for processing two‑dimensional data such as images. It initializes model components, optionally enables gradient checkpointing to reduce memory usage during training, and defines the forward computation that transforms input tensors into output representations.", "business_intent": "Offer a memory‑efficient, high‑performance transformer model for computer‑vision and other 2D data applications, facilitating scalable training and inference in production AI systems.", "keywords": ["Matryoshka Transformer", "2D data", "computer vision", "gradient checkpointing", "deep learning model", "forward pass", "hierarchical architecture", "memory efficiency"], "summary_hash": "041e5bba0e7c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:32:15+00:00"}
