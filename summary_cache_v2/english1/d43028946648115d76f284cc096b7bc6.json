{"summary": "The module contains unit tests that verify the behavior of SPADE diffusion model UNet implementations for both 2‑D and 3‑D configurations. Tests assess output tensor shapes, handling of conditioned versus unconditioned inputs, attention settings, channel dimensions, and proper error raising for invalid parameters such as mismatched timesteps.", "business_intent": "Provide automated validation to guarantee that diffusion model UNet components function correctly within the MONAI framework, supporting reliable development and deployment of medical imaging diffusion pipelines.", "keywords": ["unit tests", "diffusion model", "UNet", "SPADE", "2D", "3D", "conditioning", "attention", "channel dimensions", "shape validation", "error handling", "PyTorch", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "2ca6ca0525bb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:28:14+00:00"}
