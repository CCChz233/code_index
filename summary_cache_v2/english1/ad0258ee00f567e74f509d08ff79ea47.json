{"summary": "This module implements the core infrastructure for training Stable Diffusion models with Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO). It defines lightweight containers for pipeline and scheduler outputs, and provides a configurable pipeline class that orchestrates model components, mixed‑precision execution, checkpoint handling, scheduler stepping, and progress monitoring while exposing trainable parameters for fine‑tuning.", "business_intent": "To give developers and researchers a ready‑to‑use framework for preference‑based reinforcement learning on diffusion models, enabling efficient fine‑tuning of Stable Diffusion with reward signals and reducing the engineering effort required to set up DDPO training pipelines.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "DDPO", "preference optimization", "diffusion fine‑tuning", "reinforcement learning", "pipeline orchestration", "mixed precision", "checkpoint management", "scheduler step", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "17ceaad2a72b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:00:52+00:00"}
