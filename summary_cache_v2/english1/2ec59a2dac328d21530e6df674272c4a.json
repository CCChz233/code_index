{"summary": "The module provides a suite of audio augmentation classes and utilities for speech data preprocessing, enabling various perturbations such as gain adjustment, impulse response convolution, noise injection, random segment extraction, reverberation, temporal shifting, silence insertion, speed alteration, time stretching, codec transcoding, and white noise addition. It also includes a dataset class for loading audio files from tar archives based on JSON manifests, and helper functions for processing augmentations and reading audio segments.", "business_intent": "To enhance speech recognition model training by generating diverse and realistic audio variations, improving model robustness and generalization across different acoustic conditions.", "keywords": ["audio augmentation", "speech preprocessing", "gain perturbation", "impulse response", "noise injection", "random segment", "reverberation", "temporal shift", "silence insertion", "speed perturbation", "time stretching", "codec transcoding", "white noise", "tar archive dataset", "speech recognition"], "summary_hash": "c0cead77a9d2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:16:23+00:00"}
