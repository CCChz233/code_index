{"summary": "This module implements Django's core caching framework. It loads cache configuration from settings, creates backend instances on demand, and manages them with a thread‑local handler so each thread gets its own cache objects. A proxy object forwards attribute access to the configured default cache, allowing the legacy `cache` shortcut to work safely alongside the newer `caches` collection that provides dictionary‑like access to named cache backends.", "business_intent": "Offer a unified, configurable, and thread‑safe API for storing and retrieving arbitrary picklable objects via string keys, abstracting over multiple cache backend implementations and supporting both a default cache shortcut and multiple named caches.", "keywords": ["caching", "cache backend", "thread‑local", "proxy", "default cache", "named caches", "Django", "settings", "key warning", "invalid backend", "import_string"], "summary_hash": "112ee4b309a6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:44:55+00:00"}
