{"summary": "The StreamFeatureView class defines a logical grouping of features that can be sourced from both streaming and batch data. It encapsulates metadata such as name, entities, TTL, schema, source, aggregations, mode, timestamp field, online flag, description, tags, owner, and optional user-defined functions. The class provides methods for copying, equality checks, hashing, initialization from protobuf, conversion to protobuf, and other utility functions.", "business_intent": "To provide a unified definition for feature engineering pipelines that handle both real-time (streaming) and offline (batch) data, enabling consistent feature retrieval, online serving, and downstream model training.", "keywords": ["feature view", "streaming source", "batch source", "aggregation", "schema", "TTL", "online retrieval", "user-defined function", "entity keys", "machine learning features", "real-time serving"], "summary_hash": "52418b666390", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:17:46+00:00"}
