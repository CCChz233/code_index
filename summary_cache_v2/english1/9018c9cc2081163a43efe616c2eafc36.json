{"summary": "This module supplies a learning‑rate range test for PyTorch Lightning models. It defines schedulers that increase the learning rate either exponentially or linearly over a set number of iterations, a callback that records the learning rate and smoothed loss for each batch and can stop early if the loss diverges, and a finder utility that runs the test, stores the loss‑vs‑learning‑rate curve, visualises it and suggests a suitable learning‑rate. Helper routines manage saving, resetting and restoring optimizer and scheduler states during the test.", "business_intent": "Enable deep‑learning practitioners to automatically discover an effective learning‑rate for their models, speeding up convergence and reducing manual hyper‑parameter tuning effort.", "keywords": ["learning rate finder", "learning rate scheduler", "exponential schedule", "linear schedule", "callback", "loss smoothing", "early stopping", "visualisation", "PyTorch Lightning", "optimizer state management", "hyperparameter tuning"], "summary_hash": "c479dc525914", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:57:32+00:00"}
