{"summary": "The module implements a metric for measuring the Hausdorff distance between predicted and reference segmentation masks. It provides a cumulative metric class that accumulates surface distance information across iterations, supports optional percentile‑based Hausdorff computation, handles voxel spacing, background exclusion, and configurable reduction of batch results.", "business_intent": "To supply a reliable quantitative evaluation tool for medical image segmentation models, enabling developers to assess worst‑case boundary errors and integrate Hausdorff‑based scoring into training and validation workflows.", "keywords": ["Hausdorff distance", "segmentation evaluation", "medical imaging", "surface distance", "percentile Hausdorff", "cumulative metric", "batch reduction", "spacing handling", "background ignore"], "summary_hash": "1b86deb95d0e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:13:54+00:00"}
