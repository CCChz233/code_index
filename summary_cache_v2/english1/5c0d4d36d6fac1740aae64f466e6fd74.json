{"summary": "Provides a quantum circuit that computes the product of two quantum registers using the Quantum Fourier Transform. The circuit prepares the output register in the QFT basis, applies a series of phase rotations controlled by the input registers according to the algorithm of Ruiz‑Perez et al., and finishes with an inverse QFT to obtain the product in the computational basis, leaving the inputs unchanged.", "business_intent": "Offers a reusable building block for quantum algorithms that require efficient arithmetic multiplication, enabling developers to integrate QFT‑based multiplication into larger quantum programs such as Shor’s algorithm or quantum simulations.", "keywords": ["Quantum Fourier Transform", "QFT multiplication", "quantum arithmetic", "controlled phase rotations", "out-of-place product", "quantum circuit design", "quantum computing", "modular multiplication", "Ruiz-Perez algorithm"], "summary_hash": "e68f0f718d69", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:38:16+00:00"}
