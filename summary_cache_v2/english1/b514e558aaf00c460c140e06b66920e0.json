{"summary": "This module implements a flexible multi‑head masked self‑attention layer that projects inputs into query, key, and value tensors, optionally applies rotary positional embeddings, selects a configurable attention mechanism, adds residual dropout, and projects the result back to the model dimension. It also provides a configuration container for per‑head settings and utilities for reshaping tensors across heads.", "business_intent": "Offer a reusable, highly configurable attention component for transformer architectures in the xformers library, enabling developers to experiment with different attention algorithms, head configurations, and positional embeddings while maintaining performance and integration with PyTorch.", "keywords": ["multi-head attention", "self-attention", "transformer", "configurable", "input projection", "rotary embedding", "dropout", "residual connection", "PyTorch", "xformers"], "summary_hash": "ae76d53081d9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:29:02+00:00"}
