{"summary": "The module implements a lightweight signal/dispatch system that lets code register, deregister, and invoke callbacks using weak references, ensuring listeners are automatically removed when garbage‑collected, and provides thread‑safe event delivery. It also includes backported weak‑reference utilities for older Python versions, such as a weak reference wrapper for bound methods.", "business_intent": "Enable decoupled, memory‑safe communication between components in Django applications while maintaining compatibility across Python versions, reducing the risk of memory leaks and simplifying event‑driven programming.", "keywords": ["signal", "dispatch", "weak reference", "callback", "thread‑safe", "compatibility", "backport", "event handling", "listener", "garbage collection"], "summary_hash": "1e74ae03646a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:30:29+00:00"}
