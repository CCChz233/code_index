{"summary": "Provides an evaluator that measures how well a sentence embedding model can identify paraphrase (duplicate) sentence pairs in a large corpus by mining similar pairs, comparing them to a ground‑truth duplicate set, and computing ranking and classification metrics such as average precision, precision, recall, optimal similarity threshold and F1 score.", "business_intent": "Enables developers and researchers to benchmark and improve sentence embedding models for tasks like duplicate detection, content de‑duplication, semantic search, and data cleaning, ensuring higher quality downstream applications.", "keywords": ["paraphrase mining", "sentence embeddings", "duplicate detection", "evaluation metrics", "average precision", "precision", "recall", "F1 score", "similarity threshold", "ranking metrics"], "summary_hash": "f7f478d093e3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:55:48+00:00"}
