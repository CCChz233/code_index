{"summary": "A wrapper that loads a torchvision classification model and rewrites its final classification head. It can either replace only the last fully‑connected layer or remove the existing pooling and head and insert a new pooling layer followed by either a fully‑connected or convolutional layer, using configurable layer names and optional pretrained weights.", "business_intent": "Facilitate rapid adaptation of pretrained torchvision models to new classification problems by providing a flexible interface for head replacement and pooling customization, supporting both standard fine‑tuning and more advanced convolutional head designs.", "keywords": ["torchvision", "model customization", "classification head", "fully connected layer", "convolutional layer", "pooling modification", "transfer learning", "fine‑tuning", "pretrained weights", "feature extraction"], "summary_hash": "976284117b27", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:44:16+00:00"}
