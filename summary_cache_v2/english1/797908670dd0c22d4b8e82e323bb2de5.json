{"summary": "A collection of mock quantum device backends that emulate IBM Q hardware for Qiskit. It includes lightweight QASM and OpenPulse backends for single‑ and multi‑qubit configurations, supports both legacy (V1) and modern (V2) interfaces, and can generate realistic device properties, noise models, and calibration data from static files or random specifications.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and CI pipelines to test, benchmark, and demonstrate quantum algorithms and Qiskit features without accessing real quantum hardware, ensuring reproducible and fast simulations across different backend interfaces.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "fake backend", "quantum simulation", "testing", "OpenPulse", "QASM", "BackendV2", "noise model", "device calibration", "mock hardware"], "summary_hash": "78a3656a0b0e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:09:36+00:00"}
