{"summary": "The module defines a collection of microbenchmark utilities and model components for measuring the performance of linear and multi‑layer perceptron operations, both dense and sparsified, within the xformers framework. It includes helpers for input cloning, bandwidth calculation, and a set of benchmark cases that evaluate forward and backward passes of various kernels such as dense apply, sparse apply, sparsification, and masked dense layers using PyTorch.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with a standardized way to profile and compare the speed and memory bandwidth of different sparse and dense tensor kernels, aiding performance optimization and hardware evaluation for deep‑learning workloads.", "keywords": ["benchmark", "performance", "microbenchmark", "sparse", "dense", "linear", "MLP", "PyTorch", "tensor operations", "apply", "sparsify", "mask", "xformers"], "summary_hash": "39fdf7503294", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:28:44+00:00"}
