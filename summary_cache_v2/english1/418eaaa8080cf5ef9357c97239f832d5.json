{"summary": "A utility that retrieves an image from a data dictionary using a configurable key and computes its statistical metadata—such as dimensionality, spacing, intensity range, mean and variance—returning these values in a structured \"image_stats\" entry. It supports both raw NumPy arrays and MONAI MetaTensor objects, applying a default unit spacing when explicit spacing is unavailable.", "business_intent": "Facilitate automated data profiling and quality assurance in medical imaging pipelines by providing readily accessible image characteristics that can guide preprocessing decisions, model configuration, and validation reporting.", "keywords": ["image statistics", "metadata extraction", "numpy", "MetaTensor", "medical imaging", "preprocessing", "data profiling", "quality control"], "summary_hash": "3d9d696aeeb2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:13:41+00:00"}
