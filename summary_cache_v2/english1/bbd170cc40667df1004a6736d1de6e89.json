{"summary": "EncDecRNNTModel is a foundational component that implements an encoder‑decoder recurrent neural network transducer for speech processing. It orchestrates data preparation, model forward passes, loss computation, decoding strategies, and post‑processing, while providing hooks for training, validation, testing, and inference workflows. The class also supports dynamic vocabulary changes, export configurations, and evaluation metrics such as word error rate.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to train, evaluate, and deploy RNNT‑based speech recognition systems with flexible decoding options and seamless integration into data pipelines.", "keywords": ["RNNT", "encoder‑decoder", "speech recognition", "training loop", "validation", "testing", "inference", "decoding strategy", "vocabulary management", "export configuration", "word error rate", "data loading", "loss configuration"], "summary_hash": "d772a714c477", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:21:01+00:00"}
