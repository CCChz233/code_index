{"summary": "This module handles low‑level audio preprocessing using the PyAV library. It reads audio data from binary streams, decodes it into raw frames, normalizes and resamples the signal to a target sample rate, and provides utilities for trimming or padding the waveform to a desired length. The implementation abstracts away FFmpeg dependencies, offering a self‑contained solution for preparing audio input for downstream speech‑to‑text models.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable, dependency‑free extraction and conditioning of audio signals so that speech recognition pipelines can operate on uniformly sampled and correctly sized waveforms.", "keywords": ["audio decoding", "PyAV", "FFmpeg", "resampling", "frame processing", "padding", "trimming", "binary I/O", "numpy", "speech recognition preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "de6ac625d975", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:19:22+00:00"}
