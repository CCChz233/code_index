{"summary": "The module implements a collection of configurable residual neural network blocks and supporting utilities for building diffusion‑based models. It provides 1‑D and 2‑D residual layers with optional up/down‑sampling, group‑norm or adaptive normalization, various activation choices, and mechanisms to inject conditioning or temporal information. Helper components handle blending of spatial and temporal features and encapsulate common convolution‑norm‑activation patterns.", "business_intent": "Supply reusable, high‑performance building blocks that enable developers to construct and train diffusion or video generation models with flexible spatial, temporal, and conditional processing capabilities.", "keywords": ["residual block", "convolution", "normalization", "activation", "upsampling", "downsampling", "temporal processing", "spatial processing", "conditioning", "diffusion models", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "4da2f7354c17", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:15:11+00:00"}
