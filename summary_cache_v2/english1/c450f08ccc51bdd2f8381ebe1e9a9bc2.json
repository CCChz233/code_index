{"summary": "The package implements and demonstrates a directional Graph Substructure Network (GSN) for graph classification on the OGB molecular property dataset. It includes a preprocessing pipeline that enriches raw graphs with subgraph‑isomorphism edge statistics and automorphism orbit features, and a training module that defines custom directional graph convolution layers, a full model architecture, readout mechanisms, and utilities for training, validation, and testing using DGL and PyTorch.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and practitioners to reproduce state‑of‑the‑art graph neural network experiments, benchmark directional GSN performance on OGB tasks, and provide a reference implementation for extending subgraph‑aware GNNs to molecular property prediction.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "directional GSN", "subgraph isomorphism", "OGB", "molecular property prediction", "DGL", "PyTorch", "graph preprocessing", "graph classification", "benchmark"], "summary_hash": "c08b6a81ee75", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:56:27+00:00"}
