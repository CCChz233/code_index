{"summary": "The module defines the suite of built‑in model field classes used by Django’s ORM. Each class encapsulates a specific data type—such as integers, strings, dates, times, booleans, binary data, UUIDs, IP addresses, and auto‑incrementing identifiers—providing logic for converting between Python objects and database representations, validating input, generating appropriate database column definitions, supporting migrations, and integrating with Django form fields. It also includes lightweight utilities for loading field classes and handling empty values.", "business_intent": "To give Django developers a ready‑made, consistent set of field types that can be attached to model definitions so that data is stored, retrieved, validated, and presented correctly across the database layer, migration system, and form handling infrastructure.", "keywords": ["Django", "ORM", "model fields", "data type conversion", "validation", "database schema", "auto increment", "UUID", "IP address", "form integration", "migrations", "serialization"], "summary_hash": "427a56bbc80d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:30:09+00:00"}
