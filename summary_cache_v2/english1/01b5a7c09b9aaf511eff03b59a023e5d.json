{"summary": "The timeline visualization package assembles a backend‑agnostic system for drawing quantum circuit execution schedules. It provides a canvas that collects and manages drawing primitives, lightweight objects representing boxes, lines, text, and multi‑bit links, and generators that translate scheduled circuit data into these primitives using a configurable stylesheet. Layout utilities order quantum and classical bits and construct time axes, while a high‑level interface prepares the circuit, style, and canvas before delegating to a plotter to produce the final timeline image.", "business_intent": "To give Qiskit users a flexible, configurable way to visualize the temporal structure of quantum circuits, aiding in debugging, performance analysis, and communication of circuit execution details.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "timeline visualization", "drawing canvas", "plotter‑agnostic primitives", "schedule rendering", "layout utilities", "stylesheet", "Qiskit", "visual debugging", "gate timing"], "summary_hash": "a89aa66e2e4d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:05:33+00:00"}
