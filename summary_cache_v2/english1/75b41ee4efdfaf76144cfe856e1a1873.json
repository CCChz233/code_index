{"summary": "Implements a mixin that centralizes and standardizes indexing behavior for sparse matrix classes, providing validation, type dispatch, and helper utilities for retrieving and assigning rows, columns, and individual elements using integers, slices, arrays, and boolean masks. Includes internal functions for CSR submatrix extraction and boolean index conversion.", "business_intent": "Enable CuPy's GPU‑accelerated sparse matrix objects to support a consistent, efficient, and SciPy‑compatible indexing interface, simplifying user interaction with sparse data on CUDA devices.", "keywords": ["sparse matrix", "indexing", "mixin", "GPU", "CuPy", "CSR", "row slicing", "column slicing", "element access", "validation", "helper utilities"], "summary_hash": "c56e2efe78d2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:32:17+00:00"}
