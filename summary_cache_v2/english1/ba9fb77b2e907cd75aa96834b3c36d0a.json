{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class TestScannerRegistry. It seems to be a test class for scanning registry? Actually method names: test_load_helm_template_file, test_load_helm_vars_file, test_load_not_k8s_file, test_load_pod, test_load_utf8_bom_file. These are test methods for loading various file types (helm template, helm vars, non-k8s file, pod, UTF-8 BOM file). So the class is a test suite for a scanner registry that loads different file types. The responsibility: verify that the scanner registry correctly loads and processes various Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes configuration files, handling special cases like UTF-8 BOM.\n\nBusiness intent: Ensure reliability of file loading component in a container orchestration scanning system, supporting Helm templates, variables, pod definitions, and handling non-K8s files and encoding issues.\n\nKeywords: testing, file loading, Helm template, Helm vars, Kubernetes pod, non-Kubernetes file, UTF-8 BOM, scanner registry, validation.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed to start with {{ and end with }}?
