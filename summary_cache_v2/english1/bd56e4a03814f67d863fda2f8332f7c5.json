{"summary": "The module provides unit tests for internal logging helper utilities of the Lightning Fabric framework, checking that operations such as adding prefixes to log keys, converting objects to JSON‑compatible forms, transforming parameter structures, flattening nested dictionaries, and sanitizing both callable and regular parameters behave as expected. Simple helper functions are used to support the test scenarios.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and correctness of the logging infrastructure within Lightning Fabric so that experiment tracking and debugging information is recorded accurately.", "keywords": ["testing", "logging utilities", "prefix handling", "JSON serialization", "parameter conversion", "dictionary flattening", "parameter sanitization", "Lightning Fabric", "unit tests", "Python"], "summary_hash": "b58a0b3e63dc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:45:59+00:00"}
