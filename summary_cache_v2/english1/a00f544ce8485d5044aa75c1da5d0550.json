{"summary": "A collection of command‑line tools that prepare, evaluate, and deploy post‑training quantized speech‑to‑text models. The utilities perform calibration to collect activation statistics, run inference to assess accuracy after quantization, and optionally build TensorRT engines or export ONNX models for accelerated deployment.", "business_intent": "To reduce computational cost and latency of automatic speech recognition services by enabling low‑precision model execution while preserving transcription quality, facilitating scalable and cost‑effective deployment on edge or cloud platforms.", "keywords": ["speech-to-text", "automatic speech recognition", "post‑training quantization", "model calibration", "inference evaluation", "word error rate", "TensorRT", "ONNX export", "model optimization", "low‑precision inference"], "summary_hash": "c77029a1e240", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:56:54+00:00"}
