{"summary": "The Discriminator class implements a neural module that distinguishes between positive samples (the local neighborhood of a target node) and negative samples (arbitrary neighborhoods elsewhere in the graph). It processes node feature vectors of a specified dimensionality and outputs a score indicating how likely a given sample originates from the positive distribution.", "business_intent": "Enable contrastive learning on graph-structured data by providing a trainable component that separates true neighborhood contexts from random ones, thereby improving the quality of learned node embeddings for downstream tasks such as recommendation, fraud detection, or network analysis.", "keywords": ["discriminator", "graph neural network", "contrastive learning", "positive sampling", "negative sampling", "node features", "embedding", "binary classification", "representation learning"], "summary_hash": "7311247c28ec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:13:18+00:00"}
