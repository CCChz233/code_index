{"summary": "The class reads one or more manifest JSON files that list audio file locations, corresponding transcripts, and timing information. It parses each entry, optionally runs language‑specific preprocessing, filters samples by configurable minimum and maximum durations, limits the total number of utterances, and can prepend or append special token identifiers (BOS, EOS, PAD) to the processed text. Helper utilities allow retrieval of processed text based on file identifiers or sample records.", "business_intent": "To generate a clean, token‑ready speech‑recognition dataset from raw manifest listings, enabling reliable training and evaluation of ASR models.", "keywords": ["manifest parsing", "audio transcription", "duration filtering", "token augmentation", "preprocessing", "ASR dataset preparation", "speech recognition"], "summary_hash": "bbae0418ecfb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:15:59+00:00"}
