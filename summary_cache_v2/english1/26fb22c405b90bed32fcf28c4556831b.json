{"summary": "The module supplies a suite of profiling utilities for PyTorch Lightning, offering a common profiler interface and multiple concrete implementations (no‑op, simple timing, advanced cProfile, PyTorch‑specific, and XLA/TPU support). These tools enable users to start, stop, and collect execution statistics for training steps and custom code sections, format the results, and optionally export them for performance analysis.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with easy‑to‑integrate performance measurement capabilities to diagnose and optimize training pipelines, reduce runtime, and improve resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and TPU environments.", "keywords": ["profiling", "performance measurement", "PyTorch Lightning", "cProfile", "timing statistics", "XLA", "TPU", "GPU", "training optimization", "resource utilization"], "summary_hash": "24a051a14efa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:13:31+00:00"}
