{"summary": "The module contains a collection of test suites for the CogVideoX family of video generation pipelines, covering standard, fun‑control, image‑to‑video, and video‑to‑video variants. It provides fast unit tests using lightweight dummy models to check core capabilities such as attention slicing, fused QKV projections, VAE tiling, batch handling and callback mechanisms, as well as integration tests that run the full pipelines on GPU to verify end‑to‑end functionality and proper environment management.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness, performance and stability of CogVideoX pipelines throughout development and continuous integration, enabling developers to detect regressions early and confirm that optimization features work as expected before deployment.", "keywords": ["CogVideoX", "video generation", "unit testing", "integration testing", "attention slicing", "fused QKV", "VAE tiling", "batch processing", "callbacks", "GPU execution", "pipeline validation"], "summary_hash": "e48b5963a57b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:35:50+00:00"}
