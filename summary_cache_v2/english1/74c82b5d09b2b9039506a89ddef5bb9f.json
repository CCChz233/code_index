{"summary": "The module implements a collection of evaluation metrics for scene‑graph generation models, including AUC for binary classification, object‑level detection metrics, predicate classification scores, and the SGDet+ metric from Graph R‑CNN. It also provides helper utilities for extracting ground‑truth and predicted graph components and computing IoU‑based thresholds.", "business_intent": "To supply researchers and engineers with ready‑to‑use quantitative measures for benchmarking and improving computer‑vision models that predict objects, attributes, and relationships in images, thereby supporting development and comparison of scene‑graph generation systems.", "keywords": ["scene graph", "evaluation metric", "AUC", "object detection", "relationship detection", "SGDet+", "MXNet", "DGL", "IoU", "ground truth extraction", "prediction extraction"], "summary_hash": "abbf49436f88", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:10:52+00:00"}
