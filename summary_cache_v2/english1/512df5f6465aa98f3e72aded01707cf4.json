{"summary": "Provides a generic, hashable interface for performing depth‑first or breadth‑first traversals in a single direction over version‑control structures such as commits, trees and sub‑modules. Subclasses implement a core traversal method while the base class supplies helpers for stack management, list handling and the actual traversal logic.", "business_intent": "Enable reusable, direction‑agnostic navigation of hierarchical or graph‑like objects in a version‑control system, allowing client code to iterate over commits, trees or sub‑modules without re‑implementing traversal algorithms.", "keywords": ["traversal", "depth‑first", "breadth‑first", "hashable", "iterator", "stack", "list", "generic interface", "version control", "commit", "tree", "submodule", "graph navigation"], "summary_hash": "5202fe50c632", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:43:32+00:00"}
