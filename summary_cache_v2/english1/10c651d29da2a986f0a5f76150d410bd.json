{"summary": "A reference script that showcases how to run large‑scale image generation with diffusion models in a distributed setting using Accelerate. It loads a dataset, builds a DiffusionPipeline, processes images in configurable batches, and optionally enables low‑memory optimizations for very large models.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with a ready‑to‑run example for deploying diffusion‑based image generation across multiple GPUs or nodes, facilitating efficient, scalable inference in production or experimental environments.", "keywords": ["distributed inference", "image generation", "diffusion models", "accelerate", "batch processing", "low memory optimization", "Hugging Face diffusers", "multi‑GPU", "pipeline", "scalable deployment"], "summary_hash": "1fd76ebb9bc6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:17:29+00:00"}
