{"summary": "The module provides example scripts for training and testing the InstructPix2Pix approach, which fine‑tunes text‑conditioned diffusion models (Stable Diffusion and SDXL) to edit images according to natural‑language instructions. It includes command‑line utilities for dataset preparation, model and tokenizer setup, optimizer and scheduler configuration, optional EMA and mixed‑precision, distributed training with Accelerate, checkpoint management, validation logging (e.g., Weights & Biases), and model upload. A test script verifies model execution and checkpoint pruning.", "business_intent": "To empower developers and researchers to create customized instruction‑guided image‑editing diffusion models, enabling new content‑creation services, personalized visual editing tools, and research on controllable generative AI.", "keywords": ["InstructPix2Pix", "Stable Diffusion", "SDXL", "diffusion model fine‑tuning", "instruction‑based image editing", "training script", "checkpoint management", "multi‑GPU", "Accelerate", "validation logging", "model upload"], "summary_hash": "ff05bf2d6e6e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:36:29+00:00"}
