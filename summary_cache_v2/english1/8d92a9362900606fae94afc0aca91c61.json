{"summary": "The module provides utilities for configuring model output in a water‑balance simulation. It defines components that determine the timesteps at which results are recorded and aggregate values over user‑specified periods, as well as components that select and format the set of water‑balance variables to be written, supporting optional custom variables.", "business_intent": "Enable model users to tailor output generation—both timing and variable content—to meet reporting, analysis, and integration needs, improving flexibility and efficiency in hydrologic modeling workflows.", "keywords": ["output control", "time aggregation", "variable selection", "water balance model", "hydrologic simulation", "precipitation", "infiltration", "groundwater extraction", "MODFLOW stresses", "evapotranspiration", "metadata", "pandas"], "summary_hash": "6d6dc6160047", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:44:18+00:00"}
