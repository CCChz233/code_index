{"summary": "An abstract base class that encapsulates the logic for persisting the state of a particle‑tracking simulation. It defines hooks invoked after each particle push, decides if a save is required, and routes the storage to either a specified output directory on disk or an in‑memory container.", "business_intent": "Offer a reusable, extensible mechanism to automatically capture and store simulation snapshots at appropriate moments, supporting both disk and memory persistence while enforcing synchronization constraints.", "keywords": ["particle tracking", "simulation persistence", "abstract base class", "save hook", "post‑push processing", "disk storage", "in‑memory storage", "state saving", "synchronization", "automatic snapshot"], "summary_hash": "468072ac1ad9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:47:36+00:00"}
