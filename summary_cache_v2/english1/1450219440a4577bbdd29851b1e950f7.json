{"summary": "The module defines a suite of MONAI transforms used in the NuClick interactive segmentation workflow. It includes utilities to generate click‑based guidance maps, add label channels, create point‑wise signals with optional smoothing and jitter, extract centered patches, preprocess microscopy images, flatten and split label maps, map labels to class IDs, and post‑process probability outputs into refined instance masks.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient data preparation, augmentation, and post‑processing for training and deploying interactive nucleus segmentation models, improving accuracy and usability of the NuClick system in biomedical imaging pipelines.", "keywords": ["interactive segmentation", "click guidance", "NuClick", "data transforms", "patch extraction", "microscopy preprocessing", "label flattening", "post‑processing", "Gaussian smoothing", "MONAI", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "d57ce9b6edf2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:24:18+00:00"}
