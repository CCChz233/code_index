{"summary": "Implements a greedy decoder that converts input token IDs into embeddings, feeds them through a decoder to obtain hidden states, applies log‑softmax to produce token log‑probabilities, and iteratively selects the highest‑probability token until an end‑of‑sequence token or length constraint is met.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, deterministic generation of token sequences for applications such as language modeling, machine translation, or text completion where speed and simplicity are prioritized over sampling diversity.", "keywords": ["greedy decoding", "sequence generation", "embedding layer", "decoder network", "log‑softmax", "token probabilities", "BOS token", "EOS token", "padding token", "max sequence length", "batch generation", "model freezing"], "summary_hash": "207a2f0e83e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:46:10+00:00"}
