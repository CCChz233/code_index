{"summary": "A command‑line training script that builds and trains a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using DGL and PyTorch on standard citation graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed). It handles data loading, optional self‑loop addition, model instantiation, optimizer setup, the training loop, and periodic evaluation of node classification accuracy.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example for developers and researchers to benchmark GCN performance on popular graph datasets, illustrate best practices for graph neural network training, and serve as a baseline for further experimentation or product integration.", "keywords": ["GCN", "graph neural network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "node classification", "citation network", "training script", "graph convolution", "self‑loop", "optimizer", "evaluation"], "summary_hash": "1fb35aaf890c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:21:21+00:00"}
