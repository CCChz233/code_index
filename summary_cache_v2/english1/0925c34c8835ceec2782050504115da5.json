{"summary": "Provides the core infrastructure that lets Dask DataFrames and Series expose pandas‑style accessor attributes (such as .dt, .str, .cat). It defines a base accessor class that forwards calls to the underlying pandas objects, a descriptor for lazy creation and caching of accessor instances, and concrete accessors for datetime and string operations. Helper utilities also allow registration of custom accessors for DataFrames, Series, and Index objects.", "business_intent": "To give Dask’s parallel data structures the same convenient accessor API as pandas, enabling users to write familiar datetime and string manipulation code that works on distributed collections without materializing the full data.", "keywords": ["dask", "dataframe", "accessor", "pandas compatibility", "datetime", "string", "lazy evaluation", "descriptor", "method delegation", "registration"], "summary_hash": "3d6913ac331c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:21:06+00:00"}
