{"summary": "Utility module that orchestrates speech-to-text transcription using NeMo ASR models. It prepares audio inputs, configures models, runs inference, buffers predictions for various model architectures, computes per‑sample evaluation metrics, normalizes timestamps, restores original ordering, and applies post‑processing such as punctuation and capitalization before writing the final transcriptions.", "business_intent": "Facilitate accurate and efficient automatic speech recognition workflows, allowing developers and researchers to generate transcriptions, assess model performance, and produce polished, readable text outputs for downstream applications.", "keywords": ["speech recognition", "transcription", "ASR model inference", "audio preprocessing", "manifest handling", "prediction buffering", "word error rate", "punctuation", "capitalization", "output formatting"], "summary_hash": "80b96a36ee52", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:12:12+00:00"}
