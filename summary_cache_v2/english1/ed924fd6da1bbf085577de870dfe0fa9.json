{"summary": "A comprehensive test suite for the MODFLOW‑6 multimodel utilities, covering partition generation, model splitting (including flow and transport), exchange creation for both structured and unstructured grids, and post‑processing of partitioned simulations. The tests verify correct handling of barriers, wells, auxiliary variables, discharge, and ensure that resulting sub‑models remain executable.", "business_intent": "Validate and guarantee the correctness of MODFLOW‑6 multimodel workflows used in groundwater modeling projects, enabling reliable partitioned simulations, efficient model management, and accurate exchange of data between sub‑models.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW 6", "multimodel", "partitioning", "model splitting", "exchange creation", "structured grid", "unstructured grid", "transport modeling", "unit testing", "groundwater simulation", "hydraulic head", "water balance", "auxiliary variables", "discharge"], "summary_hash": "5c407ab1d4e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:06:02+00:00"}
