{"summary": "Applies randomly generated 2‑D linear illumination gradients to image tensors, scaling intensity with a configurable gain range and sign distribution. The effect can be applied per‑sample or uniformly across a batch, controlled by a probability flag and optional shape‑preserving behavior.", "business_intent": "Provides a data‑augmentation technique that simulates varying lighting conditions, helping computer‑vision models become more robust and generalize better to real‑world illumination variations.", "keywords": ["random illumination", "linear gradient", "image augmentation", "batch processing", "probability", "gain range", "sign distribution", "same_on_batch", "keepdim", "torch", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "4288c3bc5b8e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:54:24+00:00"}
