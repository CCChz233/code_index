{"summary": "A command‑line utility that trains a ThutmoseTaggerModel for inverse text normalization (ITN) using NeMo. It loads a Hydra configuration (default YAML file) describing dataset paths, language model backbone, label maps, optimizer settings, and trainer options, then instantiates the model and trainer and runs the training loop on the specified devices.", "business_intent": "Provide a reproducible training pipeline for building custom ITN tagger models that can be integrated into speech‑to‑text or text‑to‑speech systems, enabling accurate conversion of spoken representations (e.g., numbers, dates) into their written forms across languages.", "keywords": ["inverse text normalization", "model training", "tagger", "ThutmoseTaggerModel", "NeMo", "Hydra configuration", "language model", "BERT backbone", "dataset preprocessing", "GPU", "distributed training"], "summary_hash": "cd0e07c8464a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:45:26+00:00"}
