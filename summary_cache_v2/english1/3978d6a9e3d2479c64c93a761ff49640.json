{"summary": "The module implements a DataTransferer class and supporting helper functions that serialize and deserialize arbitrary data containers. It determines whether objects can be dumped, registers custom dump/load handlers for special types (e.g., long integers, Unicode strings, None, simple scalars), optionally offloads large objects to subprocesses, and uses pickle/base64 encoding for transport.", "business_intent": "Provide a robust mechanism for moving Metaflow workflow data between isolated execution environments, ensuring that all supported data types are correctly encoded, transferred, and reconstructed without loss or errors.", "keywords": ["serialization", "deserialization", "data container", "pickle", "base64", "custom dumper", "custom loader", "environment isolation", "Metaflow", "data transfer"], "summary_hash": "07e9efecbe47", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:12:37+00:00"}
