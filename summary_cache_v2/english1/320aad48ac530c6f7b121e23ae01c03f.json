{"summary": "LayerSummary encapsulates key characteristics of a single neural‑network layer within a LightningModule. Upon instantiation it records the layer class, total trainable parameters and, via a forward hook, captures the tensor dimensions seen as input and produced as output during the first forward pass. The stored attributes are exposed as read‑only properties for downstream reporting or debugging.", "business_intent": "Enable automated extraction of concise layer‑level information to build model summaries, assist debugging, and support documentation of model architectures in Lightning‑based projects.", "keywords": ["layer", "summary", "metadata", "parameters", "shape", "hook", "PyTorch", "Lightning", "introspection", "model analysis"], "summary_hash": "fad7edee9765", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:23:08+00:00"}
