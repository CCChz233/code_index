{"summary": "A foundational abstract class that supplies common functionality for non‑time‑dependent data packages in a groundwater modeling framework. It implements core behaviors such as data validation, spatial clipping, regridding, value composition, rendering, and various file‑output formats, and is intended to be subclassed by concrete package implementations.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to quickly create new package types by inheriting shared utilities for handling array‑based inputs, ensuring data integrity, supporting spatial operations, and producing the required MODFLOW‑compatible output files.", "keywords": ["base class", "abstract package", "groundwater modeling", "MODFLOW", "array input", "data validation", "spatial clipping", "regridding", "value composition", "rendering", "file output", "binary grid data", "text grid data", "block file", "inheritance", "template initialization", "auxiliary fields", "selection", "masking"], "summary_hash": "6984fbec6da7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:49:19+00:00"}
