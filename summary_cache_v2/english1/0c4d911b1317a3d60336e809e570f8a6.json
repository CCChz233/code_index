{"summary": "A wrapper model that leverages the Phi architecture to perform token-level classification tasks such as named‑entity recognition or part‑of‑speech tagging. It encapsulates model initialization and a streamlined forward pass that maps input sequences to per‑token label predictions.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use component for applications that need fine‑grained text annotation, enabling downstream systems like information extraction, compliance monitoring, or conversational agents to label each token in a sentence.", "keywords": ["Phi model", "token classification", "sequence labeling", "NLP", "transformer", "named entity recognition", "part of speech tagging", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "164b305a7986", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:33:38+00:00"}
