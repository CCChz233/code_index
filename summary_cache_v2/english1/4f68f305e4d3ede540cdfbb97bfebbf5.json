{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests that validate neighbor-finding operations for unstructured grid datasets. The tests cover construction of spatial index structures from various grid representations (face centers, edge centers, nodes) using both Cartesian and spherical coordinates, handling of antimeridian distance calculations, and execution of nearest‑neighbor, multi‑point, and radius queries via KDTree implementations.", "business_intent": "To guarantee accurate and robust spatial neighbor calculations within the UXarray library, enabling reliable geoscientific analyses on unstructured grids across different coordinate systems and edge cases such as antimeridian crossing.", "keywords": ["testing", "neighbor search", "KDTree", "antimeridian", "face centers", "edge centers", "nodes", "spherical coordinates", "Cartesian coordinates", "uxarray", "xarray", "spatial queries", "unstructured grid"], "summary_hash": "fd17930a8213", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:26:26+00:00"}
