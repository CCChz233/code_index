{"summary": "This module provides a collection of mixin classes that extend diffusion model pipelines with capabilities to load, fuse, unfuse, save, and retrieve LoRA (Low‑Rank Adaptation) adapter weights for various architectures such as Stable Diffusion, Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Diffusion 3, Flux, and CogVideoX. It handles weight parsing, conversion between different formats, and integration with text encoders and transformer components.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the seamless incorporation and management of LoRA adapters in diffusion‑based generative AI models, allowing developers to fine‑tune, customize, and deploy models with lightweight adaptation layers across multiple pipeline variants.", "keywords": ["LoRA", "adapter", "diffusion models", "stable diffusion", "flux", "cogvideox", "mixin", "weight loading", "fuse", "unfuse", "state dict conversion", "low-rank adaptation"], "summary_hash": "e9388d7816bf", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:11:18+00:00"}
