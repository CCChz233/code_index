{"summary": "The module defines classes that manage the geometric configuration of a telescope array. It loads telescope definitions from files, incorporates site‑specific parameters from a database, handles multiple coordinate systems and transformations, provides indexed access and addition of telescopes, and enables exporting of layout data. Custom exceptions are included for invalid coordinate data types and malformed telescope list files.", "business_intent": "To supply simulation tools with a reliable component for configuring, accessing, and converting the spatial arrangement of telescopes, ensuring accurate coordinate handling and site‑specific integration, thereby supporting performance modeling and analysis of astronomical arrays.", "keywords": ["array layout", "telescope positions", "coordinate transformation", "site model", "data loading", "astropy", "simulation", "custom exceptions", "geometric configuration", "export"], "summary_hash": "0d35e83d3e80", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:52:01+00:00"}
