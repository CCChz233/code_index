{"summary": "The module defines a configurable variational autoencoder that incorporates spatially‑adaptive denormalization (SPADE) for semantic conditioning. It supports 1‑D, 2‑D, and 3‑D data, stacked residual blocks, attention and optional non‑local attention in both encoder and decoder, and outputs latent embeddings regularized by a KL divergence term.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible deep‑learning component for conditional image reconstruction and generation in medical imaging pipelines, enabling researchers and clinicians to integrate label‑guided priors into latent representations for tasks such as segmentation‑aware synthesis, data augmentation, and unsupervised feature learning.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "KL regularization", "SPADE", "spatially adaptive denormalization", "residual block", "attention", "non‑local attention", "encoder", "decoder", "1D", "2D", "3D", "PyTorch", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "conditional generation"], "summary_hash": "d19a824a50ec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:19:27+00:00"}
