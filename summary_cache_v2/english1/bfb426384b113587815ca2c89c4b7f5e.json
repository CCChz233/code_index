{"summary": "A foundational class that encapsulates the workflow for running a neural network model in inference mode, handling input preparation, device placement, and execution without gradient tracking. It defines a callable interface that can be specialized to implement various inference strategies such as patch‑wise or sliding‑window processing.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, extensible component that streamlines model evaluation in production or research pipelines, allowing developers to plug in custom inference techniques while ensuring consistent resource handling and reproducibility.", "keywords": ["inference", "neural network", "model evaluation", "sliding window", "patch processing", "callable", "extensible", "PyTorch", "no_grad", "device management"], "summary_hash": "615c6c90811b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:12:11+00:00"}
