{"summary": "Implements a compatibility layer that translates legacy host‑delegation command‑line options used by earlier versions of ansible‑test into the modern host‑configuration model. It validates option combinations, checks controller and target Python version support, and raises specific errors for unsupported controllers, conflicting arguments, or unknown/unsupported Python versions. The module also defines utilities for determining controller Python, filtering versions, and encapsulating target provisioning modes.", "business_intent": "Preserve backward compatibility for existing ansible‑test scripts and CI pipelines that rely on first‑generation host delegation flags, ensuring they are correctly mapped to the current host‑config infrastructure while providing clear error handling for invalid or unsupported configurations.", "keywords": ["compatibility", "legacy arguments", "host delegation", "ansible-test", "controller configuration", "python version handling", "option validation", "target provisioning", "exception handling"], "summary_hash": "dad7a748282e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:52:25+00:00"}
