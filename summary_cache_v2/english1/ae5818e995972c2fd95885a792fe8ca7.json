{"summary": "This module implements the HTTP API for managing Prefect task run objects. It defines queue abstractions that combine multiple underlying task queues, enabling workers to fetch scheduled work without knowing its source. The module also provides endpoint handlers for creating, reading, updating, deleting, and setting the state of task runs, as well as utilities for task‑run history, scheduling subscriptions, and orchestration result responses.", "business_intent": "Expose a server‑side interface that allows clients and orchestration components to interact with task run records—creating them, querying their status, updating their execution state, handling retries, and integrating with the task scheduling system—so that Prefect can coordinate and monitor distributed workflow execution.", "keywords": ["task run API", "queue management", "task scheduling", "state management", "Prefect orchestration", "CRUD endpoints", "subscription", "asynchronous processing", "workflow execution"], "summary_hash": "c610bc144876", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:39:57+00:00"}
