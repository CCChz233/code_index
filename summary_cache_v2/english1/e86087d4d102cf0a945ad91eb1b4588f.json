{"summary": "The module orchestrates the conversion of a language model checkpoint into an optimized TensorRT-LLM inference engine. It parses command‑line options, configures the builder (including quantization, LoRA adapters, and FMHA settings), constructs the engine (potentially across multiple ranks), and handles serialization and optional runtime refitting.", "business_intent": "Provide a streamlined workflow for deploying large language models on NVIDIA GPUs using TensorRT, enabling high‑performance inference with support for quantization, LoRA fine‑tuning, and multi‑GPU deployment.", "keywords": ["TensorRT", "LLM", "engine building", "model conversion", "quantization", "LoRA", "serialization", "refit", "multi‑rank", "GPU inference"], "summary_hash": "931439ca7a2e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:39:29+00:00"}
