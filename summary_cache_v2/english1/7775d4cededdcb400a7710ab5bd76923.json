{"summary": "Provides test support utilities such as an in‑memory file object and a mock implementation of the built‑in open function, along with helper routines for handling image augmentation transforms and configuring deterministic random seeds. These tools allow tests to simulate file I/O and manipulate augmentation pipelines without accessing the real filesystem.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable, isolated testing of image processing and augmentation code by mocking file operations and offering deterministic configuration utilities.", "keywords": ["in‑memory file", "mock open", "test utilities", "image augmentation", "albumentations", "seed control", "deterministic testing", "filesystem mock", "numpy", "random"], "summary_hash": "bd464a371537", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:27:11+00:00"}
