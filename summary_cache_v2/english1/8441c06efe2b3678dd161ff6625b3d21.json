{"summary": "The module provides a training pipeline for a text‑to‑image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) using PyTorch XLA on TPUs. It loads and preprocesses a dataset, tokenizes captions, constructs the VAE, UNet, tokenizer and scheduler components, configures an optimizer, and runs a distributed training loop managed by a dedicated class that handles per‑step operations, checkpointing and model‑card creation.", "business_intent": "To enable researchers and developers to fine‑tune or train Stable Diffusion models on TPU clusters, accelerating large‑scale text‑to‑image generation experiments and simplifying deployment to Hugging Face repositories.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "text-to-image", "diffusion model", "TPU", "torch_xla", "distributed training", "optimizer", "dataset preprocessing", "model checkpoint", "hugging face"], "summary_hash": "1ec7046af76a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:06:52+00:00"}
