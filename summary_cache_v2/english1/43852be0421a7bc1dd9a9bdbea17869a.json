{"summary": "This test module validates the behavior of the dynamic rate‑limit handler used in the proxy layer. It defines helper utilities to simulate user authentication and mock responses, then runs a suite of asynchronous pytest cases that exercise RPM/TPM limits, cache updates, priority reservations, and multi‑project scenarios.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the dynamic rate‑limiting mechanism correctly enforces request quotas, updates its internal cache, respects priority reservations, and operates reliably across different projects and users in the proxy system.", "keywords": ["dynamic rate limiting", "proxy", "cache", "RPM", "TPM", "priority reservation", "multiple projects", "async testing", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "96cf1d1e3205", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:26:23+00:00"}
