{"summary": "The package offers utilities for the Long Range Arena benchmark, including a PyTorch-compatible dataset class for loading and accessing sequence data, and a collection of lightweight wrappers that adapt xFormers transformer models for LRA tasks. It provides processing heads, token handling, pooling, and a PyTorch Lightning module that manages optimizer configuration, training/validation/testing steps, and metric aggregation across epochs.", "business_intent": "Facilitate research and benchmarking of transformer architectures on the Long Range Arena suite by simplifying data loading and model integration, enabling rapid experimentation and performance evaluation.", "keywords": ["Long Range Arena", "LRA", "dataset", "PyTorch", "transformer", "xFormers", "model wrapper", "PyTorch Lightning", "training", "evaluation", "self-consistency", "token handling", "pooling", "benchmarking"], "summary_hash": "d88498e526a9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:34:46+00:00"}
