{"summary": "The module defines a test suite for a speech recognition RNNT encoder‑decoder model that uses byte‑pair encoding tokenization. It includes a helper model class that assembles hierarchical RNNT components and a collection of tests that verify model construction, forward computation, decoding (greedy and beam), vocabulary updates, and persistence of model artifacts, while also handling optional Numba acceleration.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and correctness of the RNNT‑based ASR pipeline with BPE tokenization, supporting continuous integration and regression testing for speech recognition products.", "keywords": ["ASR", "RNNT", "BPE", "encoder-decoder", "unit testing", "model serialization", "decoding", "vocabulary management", "nested architecture", "Numba", "PyTorch", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "12738f85a3b7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:28:50+00:00"}
