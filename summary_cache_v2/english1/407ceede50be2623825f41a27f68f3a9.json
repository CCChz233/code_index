{"summary": "The module implements a full training pipeline that fine‑tunes a Stable Diffusion XL model using consistency distillation with LoRA adapters. It loads the diffusion model and tokenizer, streams a text‑to‑image dataset from WebDataset shards, prepares image transformations, and sets up a DDIM sampler. The script configures an accelerator for distributed training, builds the optimizer and learning‑rate scheduler, runs the distillation loop computing predicted noise and original samples, and periodically validates, checkpoints, and optionally uploads the resulting model.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example for researchers and engineers to efficiently adapt large diffusion models to custom data using parameter‑efficient LoRA fine‑tuning and consistency distillation, enabling scalable image generation model training with web‑scale datasets.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "consistency distillation", "LoRA", "Stable Diffusion XL", "WebDataset", "DDIM sampling", "accelerated training", "parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning", "image generation", "model checkpointing"], "summary_hash": "a00e6c16820f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:59:16+00:00"}
