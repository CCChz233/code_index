{"summary": "The module provides an example implementation of a graph neural network workflow using PyTorch and DGL. It defines a simple feed‑forward neural network and a generic model wrapper, includes utilities for loading and preprocessing graph data, and contains scaffolding for training and evaluating the model, although several helper routines are not currently invoked.", "business_intent": "Showcase how to construct, train, and assess a scalable graph neural network (e.g., SIGN) for node classification tasks, serving as a reference implementation for developers and researchers working with PyTorch and DGL.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "DGL", "graph neural network", "SIGN", "node classification", "data preprocessing", "feedforward network", "example script", "training loop", "evaluation"], "summary_hash": "1eb4fb77a9e6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:19:06+00:00"}
