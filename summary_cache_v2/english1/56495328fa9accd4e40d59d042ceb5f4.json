{"summary": "The module implements a pure‑Python shadow of Cython's type system and runtime helpers. It defines mock representations for arrays, pointers, structs, unions, typedefs, constants, volatile markers, and parallel execution utilities, as well as a lightweight cimport emulation, allowing code that relies on compiled Cython extensions to be imported and exercised in a standard Python environment.", "business_intent": "Enable development, testing, and execution of Cython‑dependent projects without requiring C compilation by providing compatible Python stand‑ins for Cython constructs.", "keywords": ["Cython", "mock", "shadow implementation", "type system", "array", "pointer", "struct", "union", "typedef", "parallel execution", "cimport emulation", "compatibility", "testing"], "summary_hash": "776ff9efa315", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:14:20+00:00"}
