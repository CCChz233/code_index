{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests that validate the rendering, discretization, and file‑writing capabilities of the water‑quality modeling components in the imod.wq package. It uses helper functions to construct various model configurations (e.g., with standard time, cftime, no time, or alternative naming) and then exercises rendering of different package groups, solvers, and output handling, checking for correct behavior and error handling.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that the water‑quality modeling framework produces accurate and reliable simulation outputs across diverse configurations, supporting environmental analysis, regulatory reporting, and decision‑making workflows.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "water quality modeling", "imod.wq", "rendering", "discretization", "output writing", "time handling", "cftime", "pytest", "xarray"], "summary_hash": "1b145a67b95e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:56:52+00:00"}
