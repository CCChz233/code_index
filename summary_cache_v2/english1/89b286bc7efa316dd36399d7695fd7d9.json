{"summary": "The module defines a set of benchmark utilities that implement several generator patterns—plain iteration, round‑robin merging, simple and nested `yield from`—and a timing helper. Each benchmark runs the corresponding generator logic and records execution time, serving as a performance comparison suite for different generator techniques.", "business_intent": "To evaluate and compare the runtime efficiency of various generator constructions, providing data that can guide optimization decisions for streaming or iterative processing workloads.", "keywords": ["benchmark", "generator", "yield from", "round robin", "performance", "timing", "iteration", "Cython", "profiling", "execution speed"], "summary_hash": "2789d7398964", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:20:38+00:00"}
