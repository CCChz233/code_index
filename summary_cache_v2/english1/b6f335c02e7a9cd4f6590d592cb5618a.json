{"summary": "The module provides a set of utilities for object detection workflows within the MONAI framework. It includes functions for post‑processing detection outputs, validating inputs, handling padding, preprocessing, hard‑negative sampling, and inference execution. These utilities help filter predictions, ensure data consistency, select challenging negative examples, and run sliding‑window inference, streamlining the training and deployment of detection models.", "business_intent": "To streamline the development, training, and deployment of medical imaging object detection models by providing reusable components that handle common tasks such as output filtering, input validation, data preparation, hard‑negative sampling, and inference, thereby reducing implementation effort and improving model performance.", "keywords": ["object detection", "MONAI", "post‑processing", "hard‑negative sampling", "sliding‑window inference", "validation", "padding", "preprocessing", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "6646893e9781", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:32:20+00:00"}
