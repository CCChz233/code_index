{"summary": "A configuration container that holds all hyperparameters and architectural settings for a BlenderbotSmall transformer model, such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of encoder/decoder layers, attention heads, feed‑forward sizes, activation functions, dropout rates, positional limits, initialization scale, layer‑drop probabilities, embedding scaling, caching behavior, and forced EOS token handling. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate a model with a reproducible architecture.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, user‑configurable way to define and reproduce the exact architecture of a BlenderbotSmall conversational model, enabling easy model creation, customization, and downstream fine‑tuning.", "keywords": ["configuration", "transformer", "encoder", "decoder", "attention heads", "dropout", "vocab size", "hidden dimension", "layerdrop", "activation function", "positional embeddings", "cache", "eos token", "BlenderbotSmall", "hyperparameters", "pretrained"], "summary_hash": "ebec61a53267", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:03:25+00:00"}
