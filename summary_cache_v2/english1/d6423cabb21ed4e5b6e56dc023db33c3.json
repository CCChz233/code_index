{"summary": "This module provides a standalone script that loads a graph dataset, constructs a TAGCN (Topology Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network) model using DGL and PyTorch, and runs the training and evaluation loops for node classification tasks. It handles command‑line arguments, data preprocessing, model instantiation, loss computation, optimization steps, and performance reporting.", "business_intent": "To demonstrate and benchmark the training workflow of a graph neural network (TAGCN) on standard graph datasets, enabling users to experiment with node classification performance and serve as a reference implementation for graph‑based deep learning projects.", "keywords": ["DGL", "PyTorch", "TAGCN", "graph neural network", "node classification", "training script", "benchmark dataset", "model evaluation", "command line interface", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "8fd55dc5d7c5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:12:50+00:00"}
