{"summary": "The module establishes the core abstractions for Kedro's data I/O system, offering base classes that define the contract for datasets and version-aware datasets, a protocol outlining catalog operations, a version container, and a suite of custom exceptions for dataset lifecycle errors. It also provides utility helpers for parsing file paths, checking existence, generating timestamps, and loading objects, collectively enabling consistent, version-controlled data loading and saving within Kedro pipelines.", "business_intent": "To supply a flexible, extensible foundation for managing data assets in Kedro projects, ensuring reliable loading, saving, version tracking, and catalog management across diverse storage backends.", "keywords": ["abstract dataset", "versioned dataset", "data catalog", "dataset versioning", "I/O abstraction", "custom exceptions", "path handling", "protocol parsing", "timestamp generation", "caching"], "summary_hash": "3c58a570fcfc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:17:30+00:00"}
