{"summary": "This module supplies a collection of utilities that underpin Kedro's command‑line interface built with Click. It defines a custom error type, a command collection manager that can merge and resolve commands, and a lazy command group that postpones importing subcommands until they are needed. Additional helpers support loading entry points from plugins, handling verbosity flags, environment selection, and other small tasks needed for constructing and running Kedro CLI commands.", "business_intent": "Enable a modular, fast‑starting, and extensible command‑line experience for Kedro users and developers by providing reusable components for command discovery, lazy loading, error reporting, and option handling.", "keywords": ["click", "command line interface", "lazy loading", "command collection", "plugin entry points", "verbosity", "environment option", "error handling", "Kedro", "CLI utilities"], "summary_hash": "edc3a065416c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:18:03+00:00"}
