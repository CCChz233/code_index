{"summary": "Implements the GWTGWT class that creates MODFLOW‑6 groundwater‑transport exchange files needed to split a model into independent sub‑models for parallel execution. It expands transient auxiliary variables, builds exchange data structures and writes the required files, and is normally invoked by the simulation split routine.", "business_intent": "Facilitate high‑performance, parallel groundwater‑transport simulations by automating the creation of exchange specifications that couple partitioned model components.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW 6", "groundwater transport", "model splitting", "parallel simulation", "exchange files", "submodel coupling", "GWT", "auxiliary variables", "simulation automation"], "summary_hash": "491d4afdedd8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:49:08+00:00"}
