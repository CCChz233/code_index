{"summary": "The module implements beam‑search based inference utilities for attention‑based encoder‑decoder (AED) speech recognition models, including a generic decoder and a specialized batch‑level decoder for Transformer AED architectures. It defines the data flow, type checking, and hypothesis handling required to generate transcription hypotheses during inference.", "business_intent": "Provide a configurable, high‑performance decoding component that enables production‑ready speech‑to‑text systems to generate accurate transcriptions from AED and Transformer AED models using beam search, supporting multitask scenarios and integration with tokenizers and neural type specifications.", "keywords": ["beam search", "inference", "AED", "Transformer", "speech recognition", "ASR", "hypothesis", "tokenizer", "neural types", "multitask decoding"], "summary_hash": "97f1e3a4f180", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:15:54+00:00"}
