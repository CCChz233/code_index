{"summary": "The module offers tools to split a MODFLOW‑6 groundwater model into independent sub‑models based on label arrays and to construct the exchange packages that couple these sub‑models. It supports both structured and unstructured grids, handling index translation, geometric calculations, and boundary condition slicing to produce self‑contained sub‑models and the necessary flow‑to‑flow or transport‑to‑transport exchange definitions.", "business_intent": "Facilitate modular, scalable groundwater simulations by automating model partitioning and inter‑model coupling, enabling parallel execution and easier management of large or heterogeneous aquifer models.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW-6", "multimodel", "model partitioning", "submodel generation", "exchange package", "groundwater flow", "structured grid", "unstructured grid", "hydrogeology", "simulation coupling"], "summary_hash": "f9204e778808", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:06:17+00:00"}
