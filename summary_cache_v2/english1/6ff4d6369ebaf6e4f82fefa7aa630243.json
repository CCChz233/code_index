{"summary": "Provides an equivariant graph convolution layer that generates edge messages from node features, pairwise distances, and optional edge attributes via MLPs, aggregates these messages to update node embeddings, and simultaneously adjusts node coordinates using a normalized sum of distance-weighted messages, preserving Euclidean symmetry.", "business_intent": "Facilitate geometric deep learning on graphs where both node attributes and spatial positions need to be learned jointly, such as molecular modeling, 3D point‑cloud analysis, and physics‑based simulations.", "keywords": ["equivariant graph convolution", "E(n) neural network", "message passing", "coordinate update", "node features", "edge features", "MLP", "geometric deep learning", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "6eb7261a3275", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:55:48+00:00"}
