{"summary": "A Python package that abstracts the Primer3 command‑line tool, generating the required input tags from user‑defined design parameters, executing Primer3, parsing its output, and returning structured primer or probe designs along with detailed failure statistics. It includes data models for parameters, weights, tasks, and failure reasons, and supports reference genome loading and variant masking.", "business_intent": "To provide bioinformatics applications with an automated, programmatic way to design PCR primers and hybridization probes, integrating genomic reference data and variant information while simplifying configuration, execution, and result interpretation of Primer3.", "keywords": ["primer design", "probe design", "Primer3 wrapper", "bioinformatics", "PCR", "genomic reference", "variant masking", "failure analysis", "parameter configuration", "weight penalties", "command-line integration", "context manager"], "summary_hash": "9313ca1e7b69", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:12:56+00:00"}
