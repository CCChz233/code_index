{"summary": "The module contains a collection of unit‑test classes that rigorously exercise JAX's debugging primitives, including debug callbacks, debug printing, and sharding inspection/visualization. The tests cover error handling, output ordering, formatting, interaction with JAX transformations such as jit, pjit, pmap, vmap, and rematerialization, and verify that inspection callbacks fire correctly. Helper utilities and a mock device are provided to support the test scenarios.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and correctness of JAX's debugging tools so that developers can confidently use callbacks, print statements, and sharding diagnostics for troubleshooting, performance analysis, and program introspection across various execution contexts.", "keywords": ["JAX", "debugging", "unit tests", "debug callback", "debug print", "sharding inspection", "visualization", "pjit", "pmap", "vmap", "rematerialization", "test suite"], "summary_hash": "b46257d2fe82", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:03:20+00:00"}
