{"summary": "A data‑augmentation transform that adds a synthetic snow effect to an image. It can either brighten selected pixels based on a threshold (simple bleach mode) or overlay a realistic snow texture generated from Gaussian noise, with depth, blue tint, and sparkle details (texture mode). The effect intensity, brightness scaling, and probability of application are configurable.", "business_intent": "Enhance training datasets for computer‑vision models by simulating winter or snowy conditions, improving model robustness to weather variations in applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and outdoor scene analysis.", "keywords": ["snow augmentation", "image transformation", "data augmentation", "synthetic weather", "brightness adjustment", "texture overlay", "computer vision", "training robustness", "random effect", "probability"], "summary_hash": "2e962e7da260", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:17:22+00:00"}
