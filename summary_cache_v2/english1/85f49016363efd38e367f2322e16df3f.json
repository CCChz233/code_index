{"summary": "The module provides a command‑line script that fine‑tunes the Stable Diffusion XL text‑to‑image model using Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It parses training options, loads and preprocesses a dataset, prepares the diffusion model and tokenizer, runs a distributed training loop with Accelerate, performs periodic validation, logs metrics, and saves checkpoints and a model card, optionally pushing the result to the Hugging Face hub.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to efficiently adapt a large pre‑trained text‑to‑image diffusion model to specific visual domains or custom data while minimizing computational cost, enabling customized image generation services or products.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "text-to-image", "fine-tuning", "LoRA", "diffusion model", "accelerate", "distributed training", "dataset preprocessing", "validation", "model checkpoint", "model card", "huggingface hub", "tokenizer"], "summary_hash": "c3d3e4fe6117", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:05:34+00:00"}
