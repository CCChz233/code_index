{"summary": "A composable pipeline that holds a collection of callable transforms and, on each invocation, randomly selects a subset of them to apply. The subset size can be fixed or drawn from a range, sampling may be weighted or uniform, and replacement is optional. The component also supports lazy execution, per‑item mapping for iterable inputs, argument unpacking, configurable logging, and runtime parameter overrides.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible, stochastic data augmentation and preprocessing in machine learning workflows, providing varied transformations per sample to improve model robustness and generalization.", "keywords": ["random subset", "transform sampling", "data augmentation", "weighted selection", "replacement", "lazy execution", "parameter overrides", "logging", "map items", "unpack items", "pipeline"], "summary_hash": "0daddb24d4f0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:04:44+00:00"}
