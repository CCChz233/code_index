{"summary": "Provides a suite of weight initialization utilities that act as drop‑in replacements for PyTorch's standard initializers, but automatically adjust the initialization scale according to μP (mu‑parameterization) rules after the model's base shapes have been defined. This ensures identical behavior for base‑size models while correctly scaling parameters for wider models.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable and consistent parameter initialization for large‑scale neural networks, particularly Megatron‑style models, by incorporating μP‑based scaling so that training dynamics remain stable when model width is increased.", "keywords": ["weight initialization", "mu‑parameterization", "model scaling", "width scaling", "PyTorch", "Megatron", "neural network", "base shapes", "drop‑in replacement"], "summary_hash": "c4607033fb92", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:26:03+00:00"}
