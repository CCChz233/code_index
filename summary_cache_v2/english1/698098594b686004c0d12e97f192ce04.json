{"summary": "This module defines a set of symbolic pulse classes that model quantum control waveforms using symbolic expressions for their envelopes and parameter constraints. It provides lazy conversion of these expressions into callable waveforms, validation of amplitude limits, and concrete implementations for common pulse shapes such as constant, Gaussian, Gaussian‑square, and DRAG, along with utility helpers for mathematical functions.", "business_intent": "Enable Qiskit users to create, parameterize, and validate complex quantum control pulses analytically, allowing flexible waveform generation for precise gate implementation on quantum hardware.", "keywords": ["quantum control", "pulse shaping", "symbolic expressions", "parameterized waveforms", "Qiskit", "DRAG", "Gaussian pulse", "lazy evaluation", "amplitude validation", "waveform library"], "summary_hash": "36995ce12bb0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:04:09+00:00"}
