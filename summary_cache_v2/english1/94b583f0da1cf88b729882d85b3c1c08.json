{"summary": "This module implements the Suzuki‑Trotter product‑formula algorithm for approximating the exponential of a sum of quantum operators. It provides a class that builds quantum circuits representing time‑evolution under a Hamiltonian expressed as Pauli or SparsePauli operators, supporting arbitrary Trotter orders and configurable step counts.", "business_intent": "To give Qiskit users a reliable, high‑performance tool for constructing Trotterized quantum simulation circuits, enabling research and development of quantum algorithms that require accurate and efficient Hamiltonian evolution.", "keywords": ["Suzuki-Trotter", "product formula", "quantum simulation", "time evolution", "Trotterization", "higher-order", "Qiskit", "quantum circuit", "Pauli operators", "SparsePauliOp", "Hamiltonian simulation"], "summary_hash": "d2ea001851eb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:00:05+00:00"}
