{"summary": "The class coordinates a Stable Diffusion XL model to turn textual prompts into images. It manages encoding of prompts with two frozen CLIP text encoders, prepares latent representations, runs a conditional UNet with a selectable scheduler to denoise the latents, decodes them via a VAE, and optionally applies an invisible watermark. It also supports loading and saving LoRA fine‑tuning weights.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to quickly integrate high‑quality AI image synthesis into applications, support custom LoRA adaptations, and protect generated media with optional watermarking, thereby streamlining creative workflows and AI‑driven visual content production.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "Stable Diffusion XL", "diffusion pipeline", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "LoRA", "watermark", "latent space", "prompt encoding", "AI art", "generative model"], "summary_hash": "134b887093ec", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:34:25+00:00"}
