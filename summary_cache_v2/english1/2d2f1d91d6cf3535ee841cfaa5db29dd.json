{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests that validate the behavior of the grid‑clipping utility. The tests cover clipping operations on both structured and unstructured grids, including convex and concave geometries, handling of line‑based data packages, and verification that inappropriate grid types raise errors. The goal is to confirm that spatial data are correctly subset to the model domain across various grid configurations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of spatial clipping functions used in groundwater modeling workflows, ensuring that model inputs are accurately limited to the intended grid domain and that error handling works as expected.", "keywords": ["testing", "grid clipping", "structured grid", "unstructured grid", "spatial subset", "geospatial", "MODFLOW 6", "line data package", "error handling", "unit tests"], "summary_hash": "df605c7cc920", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:59:28+00:00"}
