{"summary": "This package implements Django's built‑in model field system. It defines classes for primitive data types, file and image handling, proxy fields for internal ordering, and the full suite of relationship fields (foreign key, one‑to‑one, many‑to‑many). The fields manage conversion between Python values and database representations, validation, column definition, migration support, form field integration, and expose descriptors and lookup utilities for lazy loading and query construction. Additional modules provide reverse‑relationship metadata and helper utilities.", "business_intent": "Provide a comprehensive, reusable foundation that lets developers declare model attributes and relationships which are automatically mapped to database columns, validated, migrated, and exposed through Django's forms and query APIs, thereby simplifying data modeling and persistence in Django applications.", "keywords": ["Django", "ORM", "model fields", "data types", "validation", "database schema", "migrations", "form integration", "file handling", "image handling", "foreign key", "one-to-one", "many-to-many", "relationship descriptors", "lookup utilities", "proxy fields", "reverse relations"], "summary_hash": "0b3110022375", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:31:27+00:00"}
