{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that combines a Stable Diffusion 3 transformer, scheduler, VAE, three text encoders, and optional ControlNet models to generate images from textual prompts and additional conditioning signals. It handles prompt encoding, latent preparation, classifier‑free guidance, and the denoising process.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑level, easy‑to‑integrate interface for developers to build text‑to‑image or image‑to‑image generation services that leverage Stable Diffusion 3 with optional ControlNet conditioning, accelerating product development and customization.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "controlnet", "image generation", "diffusion pipeline", "text-to-image", "latent diffusion", "prompt encoding", "classifier-free guidance", "multi-modal conditioning", "AI art"], "summary_hash": "a2f5e483c8de", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:15:35+00:00"}
