{"summary": "This module implements the backend infrastructure for Dask arrays, defining entry points for NumPy and CuPy variants and providing utilities for array creation, random state handling, conversion between backends, and low‑level operations such as concatenation, einsum, tensordot, percentile calculation, and sparse array support.", "business_intent": "To allow Dask arrays to seamlessly operate on multiple underlying array libraries (e.g., NumPy, CuPy, SciPy sparse), enabling parallel and distributed computation while abstracting backend-specific details.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "backend", "numpy", "cupy", "sparse", "random", "dispatch", "creation", "conversion", "concatenation", "einsum", "tensordot", "percentile"], "summary_hash": "5914df01aadf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:17:00+00:00"}
