{"summary": "Provides a foundational framework for generating and executing database-specific DDL statements that create, alter, or remove models, fields, indexes, constraints, and related schema elements during migration operations. It orchestrates the lifecycle of a schema change batch (start, actions, commit) to handle complexities such as circular foreign keys, and offers utilities for SQL construction, quoting, and default handling.", "business_intent": "Facilitate automated, database‑agnostic schema migrations by abstracting the creation of DDL commands and managing their execution order, ensuring safe and consistent updates to the database structure.", "keywords": ["schema editor", "DDL generation", "migration", "database abstraction", "create model", "alter field", "drop table", "index management", "foreign key handling", "transactional commit", "SQL quoting", "constraint handling"], "summary_hash": "7b1ccd88fc80", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:32:15+00:00"}
