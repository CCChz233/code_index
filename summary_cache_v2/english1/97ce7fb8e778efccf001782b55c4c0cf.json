{"summary": "This module defines a class that creates an exchange package for groundwater flow models, handling both structured and unstructured grids. It computes geometric information, coordinate names, and mappings between global and local indices. It also identifies connected cells and subdomain edges based on partition information, facilitating the creation of exchange data for coupled submodels.", "business_intent": "To automate the generation of exchange data for partitioned groundwater flow models, enabling seamless coupling between subdomains and supporting both structured and unstructured grid configurations.", "keywords": ["groundwater flow", "exchange package", "submodel partitioning", "connected cells", "grid geometry", "coordinate mapping", "partition information", "model coupling", "simulation"], "summary_hash": "42257d453265", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:00:47+00:00"}
