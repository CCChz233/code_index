{"summary": "The module implements an online Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm designed for heterogeneous document‑word graphs. It defines data structures for document, word, and edge statistics, handles gamma and Dirichlet distributions, and provides utilities for graph‑based visualization, distributed computation, model fitting, perplexity evaluation, topic prediction, sampling, and model persistence.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable topic modeling on large‑scale graph data, allowing organizations to extract thematic insights from document‑word networks with support for incremental updates and distributed training.", "keywords": ["latent dirichlet allocation", "online LDA", "heterogeneous graph", "topic modeling", "distributed training", "PyTorch", "DGL", "Dirichlet distribution", "gamma sampling", "graph visualization", "perplexity", "inference", "sampling", "meta‑path"], "summary_hash": "dae981c8c3d4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:20:01+00:00"}
