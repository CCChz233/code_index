{"summary": "A collection of dictionary‑based transforms that wrap low‑level box operations for object detection. They extract bounding box tensors (and optional labels or scores) from a data mapping, apply spatial manipulations such as affine/world‑pixel conversion, clipping, format conversion, flipping, rotation, zoom, mask generation, and random cropping, then write the updated boxes and related metadata back into the dictionary.", "business_intent": "Support medical imaging detection pipelines by providing ready‑to‑use, metadata‑aware augmentations and preprocessing steps that keep bounding boxes synchronized with image transformations, enabling seamless integration into MONMON", "keywords": ["detection", "bounding", "box", "dictionary", "transform", "medical", "imaging", "augmentation", "coordinate", "conversion", "affine", "world", "pixel", "clip", "flip", "rotate", "zoom", "mask"], "summary_hash": "4fb90f4a4b33", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:32:17+00:00"}
