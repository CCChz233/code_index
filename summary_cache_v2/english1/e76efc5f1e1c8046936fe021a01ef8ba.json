{"summary": "The module defines abstract base classes that represent an approximate quantum circuit and the associated optimization problem for approximating a target unitary matrix. It provides mechanisms for initializing circuit parameters, building the circuit, and evaluating (and optionally differentiating) an objective function to guide gradient‑free optimization of the circuit parameters.", "business_intent": "To give library users a structured way to implement custom approximate circuit constructions and corresponding objective functions, facilitating the synthesis of hardware‑compatible quantum circuits that closely approximate desired unitaries.", "keywords": ["approximate quantum circuit", "unitary synthesis", "abstract base class", "optimization objective", "gradient-free optimization", "parameter handling", "quantum circuit construction"], "summary_hash": "8fa9906df9e9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:00:23+00:00"}
