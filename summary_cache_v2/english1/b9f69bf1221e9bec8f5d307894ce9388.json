{"summary": "The module defines the core neural network building blocks of the UnivNet neural vocoder, including a generator that produces waveforms from mel‑spectrograms, several discriminator variants that evaluate generated audio at multiple periods and resolutions, a kernel predictor for location‑dependent convolutions, and supporting residual blocks. All components are implemented as NeMo NeuralModules with explicit input‑output type specifications for seamless integration into TTS pipelines.", "business_intent": "Provide reusable, high‑quality vocoder components that enable adversarial training of speech synthesis models, allowing developers to build and train state‑of‑the‑art text‑to‑speech systems with fast, high‑fidelity waveform generation.", "keywords": ["UnivNet", "neural vocoder", "generator", "discriminator", "multi‑period", "multi‑resolution", "kernel predictor", "dynamic convolution", "speech synthesis", "TTS", "PyTorch", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "c8ce5bb43ed8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:54:21+00:00"}
