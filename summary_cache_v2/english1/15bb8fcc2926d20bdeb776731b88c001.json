{"summary": "The ACES package provides a configurable, event‑driven pipeline for extracting patient cohorts from healthcare event‑stream data. It loads a YAML task configuration, constructs predicate columns from event sequences, validates constraints, aggregates data over flexible time or event windows, and recursively queries a hierarchical tree of windows, predicates, and tasks. The workflow filters, validates, and persists results as Parquet files, and includes utilities for shard expansion, subtree extraction, and integrated logging.", "business_intent": "Allow researchers and clinicians to define reproducible, complex cohort extraction queries on large event‑stream datasets, supporting sophisticated temporal/event window logic, constraint checking, and scalable output for downstream analysis.", "keywords": ["cohort extraction", "event stream", "temporal windows", "predicate generation", "YAML configuration", "Polars", "PyArrow", "data aggregation", "constraint validation", "Parquet output", "healthcare analytics"], "summary_hash": "c829ae31a4b1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:51:22+00:00"}
