{"summary": "The module showcases an end‑to‑end workflow for image‑to‑image inpainting using a Stable Diffusion diffusion pipeline. It prepares masks, processes the input image, runs the generative model, and composites the generated region back onto the original picture.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with a ready‑to‑use example that demonstrates how to integrate diffusion‑based inpainting into applications for tasks such as photo retouching, content removal, or creative image editing.", "keywords": ["image inpainting", "stable diffusion", "diffusion pipeline", "img2img", "mask preparation", "image compositing", "Python", "PIL", "torch", "transformers", "diffusers"], "summary_hash": "fe886f8eb77e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:03:25+00:00"}
