{"summary": "The sensors package supplies decorators that embed Airflow sensor operators into Metaflow flows. A shared base decorator handles common setup, argument processing, validation, and creation of Metaflow tasks, while specialized decorators configure ExternalTaskSensor and S3KeySensor instances to pause a flow’s first step until external DAG tasks finish or specified S3 objects become available.", "business_intent": "Allow Metaflow workflows to synchronize with external systems and data sources by leveraging Airflow’s sensing capabilities, ensuring that downstream steps run only after required external conditions are satisfied.", "keywords": ["Metaflow", "Airflow", "sensor integration", "decorator", "ExternalTaskSensor", "S3KeySensor", "workflow synchronization", "data availability", "validation", "task generation"], "summary_hash": "91bc7addc16c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:24:19+00:00"}
