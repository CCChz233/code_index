{"summary": "This module is intended to serve as a command‑line entry point for training and evaluating a CAREGNN graph neural network model that incorporates a sampling strategy. It imports argument parsing, DGL for graph handling, the CAREGNN model and sampler implementations, loss and metric utilities, and an early‑stopping helper.", "business_intent": "Enable users to run experiments that train a cancer‑response prediction GNN with configurable sampling, monitor performance using recall and AUC, and stop training when validation metrics cease improving.", "keywords": ["CAREGNN", "graph neural network", "sampling", "PyTorch", "DGL", "early stopping", "recall", "AUC", "command line"], "summary_hash": "a8537421407a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:12:48+00:00"}
