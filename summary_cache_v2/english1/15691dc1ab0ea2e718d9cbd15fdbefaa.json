{"summary": "The module introduces a mixin that augments any top‑level automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with an encoder‑side adapter mechanism. It allows zero‑initialized residual adapter blocks, matching the encoder's dimensions, to be inserted, configured, enabled, and controlled via the model's configuration, integrating seamlessly into the forward pass.", "business_intent": "Enable parameter‑efficient adaptation and fine‑tuning of ASR models for new domains or tasks by providing a configurable adapter layer framework without altering the core model architecture.", "keywords": ["ASR", "adapter", "mixin", "residual block", "encoder", "configuration", "fine‑tuning", "transfer learning", "parameter‑efficient", "NeMo", "speech recognition"], "summary_hash": "6ca53877436d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:14:04+00:00"}
