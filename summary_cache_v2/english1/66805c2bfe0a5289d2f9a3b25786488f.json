{"summary": "This module defines a solver that handles attribute constraints expressed as “not within” conditions. It determines the correct logical operator to apply, often by negating the behavior of the standard within‑attribute solver, enabling the evaluation of policies where a value must not belong to a given set or range.", "business_intent": "Allow the infrastructure-as-code scanning engine to assess compliance rules that specify a property must not be within certain values, thereby supporting security and governance checks that enforce exclusion criteria.", "keywords": ["attribute solver", "not within constraint", "logical negation", "operator mapping", "infrastructure compliance", "policy evaluation", "Checkov", "graph checks", "within attribute solver integration"], "summary_hash": "97fdfd18a09a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T19:46:40+00:00"}
