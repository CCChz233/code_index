{"summary": "A utility class that abstracts video retrieval from either a compressed tar archive or a regular filesystem directory. It maintains the source path, optional decoding configuration, and, when dealing with archives, an internal index mapping video filenames to their archive entries for fast random access. The class can locate a requested video, open it using a video reader, and transform the decoded stream into a list of RGB image frames.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream video processing pipelines—such as training or inference in computer‑vision models—to seamlessly ingest video data regardless of whether it is stored in a tarball or a plain folder, while handling indexing and frame extraction automatically.", "keywords": ["video loading", "tar archive", "directory scanning", "indexing", "frame extraction", "decord", "PIL", "RGB frames", "data configuration", "media pipeline"], "summary_hash": "a5459ed8b596", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:03:43+00:00"}
