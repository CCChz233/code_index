{"summary": "This module implements the S (π/2 phase) gate, its inverse, and their controlled two‑qubit variants. It supplies the unitary matrices, circuit symbols, and integration helpers so the gates can be added to quantum circuits and used in simulations.", "business_intent": "Provide ready‑to‑use, mathematically defined phase‑rotation gates for building and analyzing quantum algorithms within a quantum computing software stack.", "keywords": ["quantum gate", "phase rotation", "S gate", "inverse phase", "controlled gate", "Clifford operation", "unitary matrix", "circuit symbol", "quantum circuit library", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "580a71077f61", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:13:06+00:00"}
