{"summary": "This module offers a set of core IO transforms for medical imaging workflows. It includes a transform that reads image files from a given path, automatically picking the suitable reader based on file extension or user preference and returning data as arrays with proper axis ordering. Another transform writes tensor or NumPy image data together with optional metadata to disk, constructing filenames from metadata or indices, supporting custom folder layouts, resampling, datatype conversion, scaling, and channel handling while providing logging. Additionally, a utility persists a dictionary that maps original file locations to generated output locations in a JSON file, employing a file‑level lock to ensure safe concurrent updates. An unused helper for byte‑order conversion is also present.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless, configurable reading and writing of medical image files within deep‑learning pipelines, handling metadata, channel ordering, and file organization while supporting multi‑process safety and reproducibility.", "keywords": ["image loading", "image saving", "metadata handling", "medical imaging", "IO transforms", "file mapping", "JSON persistence", "concurrency lock", "channel ordering", "resampling", "datatype conversion", "folder layout", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "a8855a0d3f14", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:24:07+00:00"}
