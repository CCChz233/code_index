{"summary": "The module orchestrates the preparation and fine‑tuning of a language model to produce ultra‑dense, self‑contained summaries that maximize real‑world entity coverage. It reads source articles (e.g., from CSV), invokes a summarization routine, formats the output according to a strict schema, and logs the process. Helper utilities streamline the distillation of raw summarization results.", "business_intent": "Enable organizations to automatically generate compact, information‑rich summaries for large text corpora, facilitating downstream tasks such as knowledge‑graph construction, rapid information retrieval, and content indexing.", "keywords": ["summarization", "dense summary", "entity extraction", "fine‑tuning", "OpenAI", "CSV processing", "Pydantic schema", "logging", "chain‑of‑density", "model training", "data preparation"], "summary_hash": "7571fef6973c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:43:40+00:00"}
