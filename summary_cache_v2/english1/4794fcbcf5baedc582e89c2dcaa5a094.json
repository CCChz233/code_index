{"summary": "The module defines a hierarchy of precision plugins for PyTorch Lightning, offering a base class and concrete implementations for various numeric formats such as full‑precision, half‑precision, mixed‑precision (AMP), DeepSpeed, Fully Sharded Data Parallel, double‑precision, and XLA/TPU support. Each plugin encapsulates the required dtype conversions, gradient scaling, optimizer handling, and context management to seamlessly integrate the chosen precision mode into the Lightning training loop.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to accelerate model training and reduce memory consumption by automatically selecting and managing the optimal numerical precision for the target hardware and library stack, thereby improving performance, scalability, and ease of use in production‑grade deep‑learning workflows.", "keywords": ["precision plugin", "mixed precision", "automatic mixed precision", "fp16", "bf16", "fp32", "double precision", "DeepSpeed", "FSDP", "XLA", "TPU", "gradient scaling", "optimizer unscaling", "PyTorch Lightning"], "summary_hash": "a02c500fd622", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:14:09+00:00"}
