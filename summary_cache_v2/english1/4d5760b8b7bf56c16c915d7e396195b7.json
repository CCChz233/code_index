{"summary": "The file defines the HoVerNet architecture for nuclei segmentation and classification in histology images. It includes the main HoVerNet class and several internal components such as decoder blocks, branches, dense layers, residual blocks, and transition utilities. The architecture supports configurable input channels, output classes, activation functions, normalization layers, dropout, and pretrained encoder weights. The model can operate in either the original or fast mode, providing flexibility for different performance and accuracy requirements.", "business_intent": "The purpose of this file is to provide a ready-to-use deep learning model for biomedical image analysis, specifically for detecting and classifying cell nuclei in histopathology slides. This can be used in research, clinical diagnostics, and competitions such as the CoNIC challenge.", "keywords": ["HoVerNet", "nuclei segmentation", "nuclei classification", "histology", "deep learning", "convolutional neural network", "encoder-decoder", "ResNet50", "pretrained weights", "fast mode", "original mode", "dropout", "batch norm", "activation", "deterministic behavior", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "4f41ffe65de0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:18:23+00:00"}
