{"summary": "This module implements a full training pipeline for a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN). It sets up data loading and preprocessing, initializes the VQGAN model and its discriminator, configures optimizers, learning‑rate schedules, and exponential moving average handling, and runs the training loop with optional mixed‑precision and distributed support via Accelerate. The script also handles logging, validation, checkpoint saving, and optional integration with Weights & Biases.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example that enables researchers and developers to train VQGAN models for high‑quality image synthesis, facilitating experimentation, reproducibility, and integration into larger AI workflows.", "keywords": ["VQGAN", "image synthesis", "vector quantization", "GAN", "discriminator", "perceptual loss", "gradient penalty", "accelerate", "distributed training", "PyTorch", "EMA", "learning rate scheduler", "data preprocessing", "checkpointing", "wandb"], "summary_hash": "36c17f4c3fd4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:58:51+00:00"}
