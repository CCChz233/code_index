{"summary": "The module defines a PhaseOracle class that constructs quantum circuits implementing phase-oracle functionality. It parses Boolean expressions or DIMACS CNF files, interprets logical operators and literals, and synthesizes a circuit that applies a phase flip to computational basis states satisfying the given logical condition.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum algorithm developers to quickly generate phase-oracle circuits for algorithms such as Grover's search, allowing problem constraints to be expressed as Boolean formulas or CNF files and automatically translated into Qiskit circuits.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "phase oracle", "Boolean expression", "DIMACS CNF", "oracle synthesis", "Qiskit", "Grover's algorithm", "logical parsing", "circuit generation", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "619958bea584", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:09:08+00:00"}
