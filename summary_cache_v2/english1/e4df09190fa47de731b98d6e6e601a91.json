{"summary": "Provides a Metaflow step decorator that intercepts all exceptions raised during a step, treats the step as successful, optionally records the exception in a named artifact, and prints it. Includes a reusable failure‑handling strategy class that centralizes this catch logic for runtime failures.", "business_intent": "Allow workflow developers to build resilient pipelines that continue execution despite step errors, while capturing error details for later inspection and debugging.", "keywords": ["Metaflow", "decorator", "exception handling", "step failure", "artifact logging", "workflow resilience", "error capture", "runtime failure management"], "summary_hash": "004562e4b360", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:03:45+00:00"}
