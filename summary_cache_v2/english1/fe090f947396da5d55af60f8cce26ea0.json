{"summary": "A configurable Mega architecture model that can operate as a self‑attention‑only encoder or, when enabled, as a decoder that adds a cross‑attention layer after self‑attention. The behavior is controlled by configuration flags for decoder mode, bidirectionality, and cross‑attention inclusion, allowing seamless integration into sequence‑to‑sequence pipelines.", "business_intent": "Offer a versatile, high‑performance attention module for natural‑language processing applications such as translation, summarization, and other seq2seq tasks, providing both encoding and decoding capabilities within a single model class.", "keywords": ["Mega architecture", "self‑attention", "cross‑attention", "decoder", "encoder", "seq2seq", "transformer", "gated attention", "moving average", "configurable model"], "summary_hash": "ea54257641b8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:17:22+00:00"}
