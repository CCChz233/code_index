{"summary": "The class encapsulates the ionization state distribution of a set of elements or isotopes, storing ionic fractions, relative abundances, and a density scaling factor. It derives number densities from these inputs, optionally using an electron temperature and a kappa parameter for non‑thermal distributions, and provides dictionary‑like access to retrieve or modify the fractions or densities for each species. It also supports normalization checks, equality comparison within a tolerance, and utilities such as averaging the ion charge.", "business_intent": "Enable scientists and engineers to model multi‑species plasmas by managing ionization balances, computing species number densities, and integrating temperature‑dependent or kappa‑distributed ionization data in simulations and analyses.", "keywords": ["ionization state", "plasma", "ionic fractions", "abundance", "number density", "electron temperature", "kappa distribution", "tolerance", "species collection", "average ion charge"], "summary_hash": "8b6939002898", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:49:01+00:00"}
