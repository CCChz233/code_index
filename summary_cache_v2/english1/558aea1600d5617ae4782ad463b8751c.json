{"summary": "Encapsulates a single invocation of an operation within a Keras functional graph, storing the operation reference, the arguments used during the call, and the resulting output tensors. It links to preceding and following nodes via the operation’s inbound and outbound node collections, enabling the graph to be traversed as a directed acyclic structure.", "business_intent": "Provides the metadata necessary to build, query, and walk the computational DAG of a Keras Function, allowing tools and runtime components to understand how tensors are produced and consumed across multiple calls of the same operation.", "keywords": ["Keras", "node", "operation", "call metadata", "tensor", "graph", "DAG", "inbound", "outbound", "history", "functional API"], "summary_hash": "2a4dee6426ae", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:32:00+00:00"}
