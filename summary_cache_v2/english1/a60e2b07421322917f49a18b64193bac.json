It integrates UNet, VQ autoencoder, multilingual CLIP, tokenizers, schedulers, and utilities for mask handling and image resizing.\n\nBusiness intent: Offer developers a comprehensive set of ready-to-use pipelines to generate, edit, and manipulate images using the Kandinsky diffusion models, facilitating integration of AI-powered visual content creation into applications.\n\nKeywords: Kandinsky, diffusion pipelines, text-to-image, image-to-image, inpainting,", "business_intent": "We need to produce JSON for each file?
