{"summary": "The module implements a framework for defining, configuring, and executing simulation scenarios in the TLOmodel. It offers an abstract base for scenario specifications, mechanisms to generate parameter draws, persist draw configurations, dynamically load scenario classes, and coordinate the execution of sampled runs. It also includes utilities for handling logging, parameter overrides, and creating Cartesian grids of parameter combinations.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and analysts to systematically create, parameterize, and run multiple health system simulation experiments with reproducible configurations and controlled randomness, supporting exploratory analysis and model validation.", "keywords": ["scenario", "simulation", "parameter draw", "run execution", "configuration", "logging", "module loading", "parameter grid", "health model", "TLOmodel", "experiment management"], "summary_hash": "2eb39da7bf55", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:46:59+00:00"}
