{"summary": "Implements a synthetic graph dataset that builds two Barabási–Albert graphs, enriches each with house‑shaped motifs, adds random perturbation edges and inter‑graph connections, assigns eight node classes (four per subgraph) and generates 10‑dimensional Gaussian node features. The class follows the DGL dataset interface, handling caching, processing, and providing graph objects with label and feature node data.", "business_intent": "Supply a ready‑made benchmark for training and evaluating graph neural network models and explanation techniques (e.g., GNNExplainer) on a controlled multi‑class node classification problem.", "keywords": ["synthetic graph dataset", "Barabási–Albert", "house motif", "node classification", "GNNExplainer", "DGL", "graph neural networks", "feature generation", "label assignment", "benchmark"], "summary_hash": "c1786df22b63", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:44:39+00:00"}
