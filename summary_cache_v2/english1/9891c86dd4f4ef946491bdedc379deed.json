{"summary": "FlattenLabeld is a transform that converts a binary or multi-label image into a set of unique label identifiers, assigning a distinct label to each connected component based on a specified connectivity. It processes the input data and outputs a label map where each isolated region receives its own class index.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream analysis by separating individual objects in segmentation masks, supporting tasks such as object counting, region-based statistics, and preparation of data for machine learning pipelines that require distinct label IDs per object.", "keywords": ["connected components", "label map", "connectivity", "segmentation", "image processing", "region labeling", "flatten labels", "data transform", "object counting", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "1f11d719b95e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:10:37+00:00"}
