{"summary": "The module supplies utilities for constructing a quantum circuit that implements a target two‑qubit interaction expressed as exp(i·(a·XX + b·YY + c·ZZ)). It translates the desired operation into a sequence of native XX‑type gates (with given interaction strengths) combined with local single‑qubit rotations, using a right‑angled path decomposition to achieve an optimal layout.", "business_intent": "Provide a hardware‑aware synthesis tool that converts abstract two‑qubit interactions into executable gate sequences for platforms whose native entangling operation is an XX interaction, thereby reducing gate count and improving execution fidelity.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit synthesis", "two-qubit gate decomposition", "XX interaction", "RXX gate", "RYY gate", "RZ gate", "right‑angled path", "optimal circuit construction", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "7d99a9226b9e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:01:25+00:00"}
