{"summary": "The script orchestrates the fine‑tuning of a Megatron‑based Griffin language model using NVIDIA NeMo. It loads a Hydra configuration, builds a Megatron LMPP trainer, applies parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning (PEFT) settings, and runs the experiment with NeMo's experiment manager and logging utilities.", "business_intent": "Enable users to adapt large pretrained Megatron language models to specific downstream tasks through efficient fine‑tuning, facilitating deployment of customized NLP solutions.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "Griffin", "SFT", "fine-tuning", "language modeling", "NVIDIA NeMo", "PEFT", "Hydra", "distributed training", "experiment manager"], "summary_hash": "184f72cc70f2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:44:29+00:00"}
