{"summary": "The module defines a set of Ignite‑compatible handlers that compute common regression metrics—such as absolute error, squared error, root‑mean‑squared error, and peak signal‑to‑noise ratio—by accumulating results over batches and training iterations, enabling automatic logging and monitoring during MONAI model training and evaluation.", "business_intent": "To provide ready‑to‑use metric tracking for medical imaging regression tasks (e.g., image reconstruction, denoising, super‑resolution), allowing developers to assess model performance with standard quantitative measures without implementing custom aggregation logic.", "keywords": ["regression metrics", "mean absolute error", "mean squared error", "root mean squared error", "PSNR", "MONAI", "Ignite", "handler", "medical imaging", "deep learning", "model evaluation"], "summary_hash": "79460b6f0988", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:10:00+00:00"}
