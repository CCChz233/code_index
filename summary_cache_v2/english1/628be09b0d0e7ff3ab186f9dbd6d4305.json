{"summary": "This module defines a trainer that orchestrates the training of generalized knowledge distillation models. It integrates with Hugging Face Transformers and Accelerate, supports DeepSpeed for distributed optimization, computes specialized loss terms such as a generalized Jensen‑Shannon divergence, performs on‑policy generation for evaluation, and automatically creates model documentation.", "business_intent": "Enable enterprises and researchers to efficiently fine‑tune large language models using knowledge distillation techniques, reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving model quality, and simplifying deployment through automated documentation and scalable training.", "keywords": ["knowledge distillation", "generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence", "DeepSpeed", "distributed training", "model fine-tuning", "Hugging Face Transformers", "on-policy generation", "model documentation", "trainer", "large language models"], "summary_hash": "76a8dbfb9f6f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:59:36+00:00"}
