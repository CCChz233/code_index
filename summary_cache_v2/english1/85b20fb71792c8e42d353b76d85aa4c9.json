{"summary": "Provides a PyTorch module that implements the Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC) operation for graph neural networks. The layer propagates node features through a normalized adjacency matrix for a configurable number of steps, optionally caches the propagated features, applies a linear transformation, and supports bias addition and feature normalization.", "business_intent": "Enables developers to incorporate an efficient, low‑complexity graph convolution layer into DGL‑based models, reducing training time and memory usage while maintaining performance for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph representation learning.", "keywords": ["Simplified Graph Convolution", "SGC", "graph neural network", "PyTorch", "DGL", "adjacency propagation", "node features", "linear transformation", "caching", "bias", "feature normalization", "graph convolution layer"], "summary_hash": "14dbb5bec806", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:45:07+00:00"}
