{"summary": "A neural network wrapper that predicts coil sensitivity maps from complex multi‑coil MRI data using a configurable convolutional architecture (defaulting to a complex UNet). It trains on the fully sampled central region of undersampled k‑space and outputs sensitivity maps aligned with the specified coil dimension.", "business_intent": "Enable more accurate and efficient multi‑coil MRI reconstruction by automatically estimating coil sensitivities through deep learning.", "keywords": ["MRI", "coil sensitivity", "multi-coil", "deep learning", "convolutional network", "UNet", "k-space", "undersampled", "complex data", "image reconstruction"], "summary_hash": "271b48c0d3f4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:19:57+00:00"}
