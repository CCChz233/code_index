{"summary": "The module defines a suite of unit tests for the registration components of MONAI's RegUNet architecture, covering down‑sampling, feature extraction, and residual convolution blocks. The tests verify correct tensor dimensionality handling, proper operation under valid inputs, and appropriate error raising for malformed data.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and robustness of registration block implementations used in medical imaging deep learning models, ensuring reliable behavior before integration into production pipelines.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "registration downsample block", "registration extraction block", "residual convolution block", "tensor shape validation", "error handling", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "deep learning", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "2262993cb728", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:21:39+00:00"}
