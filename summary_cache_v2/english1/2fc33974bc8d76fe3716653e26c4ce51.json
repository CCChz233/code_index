{"summary": "The class coordinates a text‑to‑video diffusion pipeline, turning natural‑language prompts into video frames. It combines a conditional 3‑D transformer for denoising latent video tensors, a diffusion scheduler, a variational auto‑encoder for encoding/decoding image latents, and dual text encoders with tokenizers (T5 and CLIP) to generate prompt embeddings. It handles input validation, latent preparation, classifier‑free guidance scaling, and runtime controls such as interruption and VAE performance options (slicing/tiling).", "business_intent": "Provide an easy‑to‑use generative AI tool that creates short videos from textual descriptions, targeting developers, marketers, and media creators who need automated video content for advertising, entertainment, rapid prototyping, or AI‑enhanced production pipelines.", "keywords": ["text-to-video", "diffusion", "transformer", "scheduler", "variational autoencoder", "VAE", "text encoder", "tokenizer", "classifier-free guidance", "latent generation", "video synthesis", "generative AI", "media creation", "prompt conditioning"], "summary_hash": "ac942695519c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:17:50+00:00"}
