{"summary": "The permutation synthesis package implements algorithms that convert arbitrary permutation specifications into quantum circuits. It includes a general method for fully connected qubit layouts that decomposes permutations into cycles and ordered swaps, a depth‑optimized technique for linear nearest‑neighbor architectures using swap layers and pattern inversion, and a collection of low‑level utilities for handling permutation representations, inverses, and elementary swap extraction.", "business_intent": "Provide quantum software developers with tools to efficiently realize permutation unitaries on quantum hardware, supporting both unrestricted and nearest‑neighbor connectivity, thereby facilitating the construction of larger quantum algorithms and optimizing circuit depth and gate count.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit synthesis", "permutation", "swap network", "cycle decomposition", "linear nearest neighbor", "Qiskit", "quantum computing", "connectivity constraints", "algorithm optimization", "utility functions"], "summary_hash": "0cbc6a6164fd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:04:03+00:00"}
