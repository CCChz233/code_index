{"summary": "The package supplies a set of scenario classes that configure and run postnatal care (PNC) simulations for maternal and perinatal health analyses. Each scenario builds the required health‑system and disease modules, generates the appropriate parameter sets, records the configuration, and integrates with the TLO modeling framework. The collection includes enhanced‑coverage scenarios and both maximum‑ and minimum‑value sensitivity analyses.", "business_intent": "To support health analysts and policymakers in quantifying the effects of improved postnatal care coverage and quality, and in understanding how model outcomes respond to parameter uncertainty, thereby informing evidence‑based maternal and perinatal health strategies.", "keywords": ["postnatal care", "scenario modeling", "sensitivity analysis", "maternal health", "perinatal health", "parameter sampling", "model configuration", "health system modules", "disease modules", "coverage improvement"], "summary_hash": "76a5b1f1f2ce", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:06:07+00:00"}
