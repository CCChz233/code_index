{"summary": "This module supplies a full suite of PointNet++ building blocks implemented with PyTorch and DGL, including distance and indexing helpers, fixed‑radius graph construction, ball‑query neighbor retrieval, set abstraction layers (single‑scale and multi‑scale), feature propagation, point convolution, and classification heads. These components enable hierarchical feature learning on unordered 3‑D point clouds.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑use framework for developing and training deep neural networks that analyze 3‑D point‑cloud data, supporting applications such as object classification, segmentation, and feature extraction in autonomous driving, robotics, AR/VR, and other spatial perception domains.", "keywords": ["point cloud", "PointNet++", "set abstraction", "multi‑scale grouping", "single‑scale grouping", "graph neural network", "fixed radius neighbor", "ball query", "feature propagation", "point convolution", "classification", "PyTorch", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "2d01de31e266", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:25:19+00:00"}
