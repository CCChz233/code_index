{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that converts textual prompts into images using Stable Diffusion, optionally enhanced with ControlNet conditioning and experimental Prompt Diffusion. It manages prompt and image encoding, latent preparation, denoising, VAE decoding, safety checking, and offers configurable options such as VAE slicing, FreeU, and LoRA/textual‑inversion loading.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with an easy‑to‑use, extensible API for generating high‑quality, controllable AI‑generated images from text, while ensuring safety and supporting model customization for creative, commercial, or research applications.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "stable diffusion", "controlnet", "prompt diffusion", "generative AI", "image generation", "safety checker", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "FreeU"], "summary_hash": "df11444034ac", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:06:21+00:00"}
