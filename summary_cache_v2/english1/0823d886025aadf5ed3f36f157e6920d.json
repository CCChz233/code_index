{"summary": "The package converts NeMo language‑model checkpoints into optimized TensorRT‑LLM inference engines. It extracts model configurations, adapts them for TensorRT‑LLM, applies optional quantization and LoRA adapters, builds and serializes the engine, and provides a distributed runtime for fast text generation.", "business_intent": "To accelerate deployment of large language models on NVIDIA GPUs by offering a streamlined pipeline that transforms research‑grade NeMo models into high‑throughput, low‑latency TensorRT‑LLM services, supporting quantization, model parallelism, and scalable inference.", "keywords": ["NeMo", "TensorRT-LLM", "model export", "inference engine", "quantization", "LoRA", "GPU acceleration", "large language model", "model parallelism", "distributed inference", "MPI"], "summary_hash": "be5639fd00b7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:11:55+00:00"}
