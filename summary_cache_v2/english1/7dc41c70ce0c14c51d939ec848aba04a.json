{"summary": "The file defines abstract base classes that specify the required interface for RNNT decoder and joint components within the NeMo ASR framework. The decoder abstraction handles stateful autoregressive token prediction, hypothesis scoring, batch state manipulation, and blank‑token processing to support greedy and beam‑search decoding. The joint abstraction describes how encoder and prediction embeddings are combined into logits for downstream decoding.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, extensible foundation for implementing custom RNNT decoder and joint modules, enabling seamless integration with NeMo's speech‑recognition training and inference pipelines.", "keywords": ["RNNT", "decoder", "joint", "abstract base class", "speech recognition", "NeMo", "stateful decoding", "hypothesis scoring", "beam search", "greedy inference", "neural transducer"], "summary_hash": "22d6478edc02", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:06:08+00:00"}
