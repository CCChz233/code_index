{"summary": "LaborSampler constructs layer‑wise mini‑batches for graph neural networks by sampling a configurable number of inbound or outbound neighbors per edge type, optionally using probability‑weighted or importance sampling, and can share random variates across layers. It also supports prefetching node and edge features and placing the sampled subgraphs on a chosen device.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, flexible neighbor‑sampling mechanism that mitigates the neighborhood explosion problem in GNN training, enabling efficient minibatch learning on large homogeneous or heterogeneous graphs for tasks such as node classification, edge classification, and link prediction.", "keywords": ["neighbor sampling", "graph neural network", "mini-batch", "heterogeneous graph", "importance sampling", "probability weighting", "layer dependency", "feature prefetch", "device placement", "fanout control"], "summary_hash": "34c9fc1351ae", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:36:00+00:00"}
