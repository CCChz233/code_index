{"summary": "The class assesses a sentence embedding model's ability to distinguish similar from dissimilar sentence pairs. It computes embeddings for two lists of sentences, measures similarity using configurable metrics (cosine, dot product, Euclidean, Manhattan), determines optimal thresholds, and reports accuracy, F1, precision, recall, average precision, and Matthews correlation. Results can be logged to a CSV file, with optional batching, progress display, and dimensional truncation.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑use evaluation component for developers and researchers to benchmark and compare sentence embedding models on binary similarity tasks such as duplicate detection or paraphrase identification, facilitating model selection, performance tracking, and reporting.", "keywords": ["binary classification", "sentence embeddings", "similarity metrics", "cosine similarity", "dot product", "Euclidean distance", "Manhattan distance", "accuracy", "F1 score", "precision"], "summary_hash": "524cc6495a34", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:56:05+00:00"}
