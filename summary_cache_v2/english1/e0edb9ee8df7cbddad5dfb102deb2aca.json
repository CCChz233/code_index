{"summary": "Manages execution of experiment stages by launching each stage in a separate operating‑system process, abstracting the details of where those processes run (locally or on remote services). It provides a common framework for out‑of‑process experiment orchestration, handling process creation, monitoring, and result collection while keeping the calling code independent of the execution environment.", "business_intent": "Enable isolated, scalable, and fault‑tolerant execution of experimental workflows, allowing teams to run stages locally or on cloud services such as AWS Batch without modifying experiment logic.", "keywords": ["out‑of‑process", "experiment orchestration", "process forking", "stage isolation", "remote execution", "local execution", "AWS Batch", "scalable workflow", "fault tolerance", "resource isolation"], "summary_hash": "a2e7bbd18b20", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:42:46+00:00"}
