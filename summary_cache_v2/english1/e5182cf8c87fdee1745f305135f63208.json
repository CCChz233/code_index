Additionally, it provides a custom file wrapper that tracks file access and a trivial getter function.", "business_intent": "To furnish test fixtures and helper classes that enable verification of custom Django model field logic, such as automatic dimension handling for images and diverse foreign‑key configurations.", "keywords": ["Django", "models", "ImageField", "height calculation", "foreign key", "CharField primary key", "BooleanField", "test fixtures", "iterator", "file wrapper"], "summary_hash": "31a07e2e4329", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:04:49+00:00"}
