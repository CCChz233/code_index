{"summary": "An end‑to‑end pipeline that takes an input image and a natural‑language instruction, encodes the image into latent space, processes the instruction with dual CLIP text encoders, runs a conditional diffusion denoising step using a UNet and scheduler, and decodes the result back to a pixel‑level edited image. It supports optional aesthetic conditioning, zero‑negative prompts, invisible watermarking, and loading of LoRA or textual‑inversion weights.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and creative professionals with a programmable tool for high‑quality, text‑driven image manipulation, enabling automated retouching, content generation, and visual effects workflows.", "keywords": ["image editing", "text‑guided diffusion", "Stable Diffusion XL", "pixel‑level transformation", "latent diffusion", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "watermarking", "aesthetic conditioning", "COSXL scaling"], "summary_hash": "84eaa16d5e3e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:21:10+00:00"}
