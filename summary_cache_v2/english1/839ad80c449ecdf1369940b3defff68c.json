{"summary": "Implements a WordPiece‑based tokenizer that reads a vocabulary file and converts raw text into subword token sequences, handling optional lower‑casing, accent removal, basic tokenization, Chinese character splitting, and preservation of user‑specified tokens. It also manages special tokens such as unknown, separator, padding, classifier, mask, and a dedicated question token, and can construct model‑ready input arrays with appropriate token type IDs and special‑token masks.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream NLP models, particularly the Splinter architecture, to receive properly tokenized and encoded text inputs for tasks like classification, question answering, and masked language modeling.", "keywords": ["WordPiece", "subword tokenization", "vocabulary", "special tokens", "lowercasing", "accent stripping", "Chinese character handling", "token type IDs", "masking", "question representation"], "summary_hash": "3271b1796943", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:17:46+00:00"}
