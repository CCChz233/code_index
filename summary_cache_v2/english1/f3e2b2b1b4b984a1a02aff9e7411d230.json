{"summary": "A configuration container for a MusicGen decoder model that specifies all architectural hyperparameters, including vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of decoder layers, attention heads, feed‑forward size, activation functions, dropout rates, positional embedding limits, initialization scale, layer drop, embedding scaling, caching behavior, number of parallel codebooks, embedding tying, and audio channel count. It enables instantiation of a decoder matching the default facebook/musicgen‑small setup or custom variants.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to define, reproduce, and customize the architecture of a MusicGen decoder for music generation, supporting model creation, fine‑tuning, and deployment with precise control over transformer and audio‑specific settings.", "keywords": ["configuration", "MusicGen decoder", "transformer architecture", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "feed‑forward network", "dropout", "positional embeddings", "codebooks", "audio channels", "model instantiation", "pretrained config"], "summary_hash": "b2f1c39735c2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:40:46+00:00"}
