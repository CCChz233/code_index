{"summary": "The module establishes a Pint UnitRegistry for the xclim library and implements a suite of utilities for handling physical units. It provides mechanisms to declare expected units for variables, convert values between units, map Pint units to CF-compliant strings, and wrap functions with automatic unit validation and conversion. Additional helper functions support string transformations and unit arithmetic.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable unit management and conversion within climate data processing, ensuring that calculations adhere to correct physical dimensions and CF conventions.", "keywords": ["units", "pint", "unit conversion", "validation", "climate", "xclim", "CF conventions", "registry", "decorator", "wrapper"], "summary_hash": "55e52709979b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:33:07+00:00"}
