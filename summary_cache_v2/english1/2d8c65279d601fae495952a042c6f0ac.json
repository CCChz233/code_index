{"summary": "The module contains unit‑test suites for the analysis subpackage of Plasmapy. One suite validates the behavior of fitting utilities, checking abstract base class contracts, concrete model implementations, parameter handling, string representations, curve fitting, and root‑finding. The other suite verifies null‑point analysis tools, testing bilinear root finding, classification, zero‑crossing detection, reduction calculations, and trilinear analysis, with placeholders for additional helpers.", "business_intent": "Provide comprehensive automated verification of plasma analysis algorithms to ensure accurate scientific computations, maintain code quality, and support reliable research outcomes in plasma physics applications.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "plasma analysis", "fitting functions", "null point analysis", "curve fitting", "root finding", "scientific computing", "validation", "Plasmapy", "software quality assurance"], "summary_hash": "73a889a916a8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:16:27+00:00"}
