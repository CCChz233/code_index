{"summary": "The module implements a multimodal token‑classification model that restores missing punctuation and correct capitalization in transcribed speech. It combines lexical embeddings from a BERT‑style language encoder with acoustic embeddings from an ASR encoder, processes the fused representation through a transformer decoder, and uses separate MLP heads for punctuation and capitalization prediction. The model also includes utilities for adapting its configuration to support adapter modules.", "business_intent": "Enable speech‑to‑text platforms to automatically produce properly punctuated and capitalized transcripts, improving readability and downstream processing such as analytics, search, and user interaction.", "keywords": ["punctuation restoration", "capitalization correction", "multimodal model", "lexical embeddings", "acoustic embeddings", "ASR encoder", "BERT encoder", "transformer decoder", "MLP heads", "adapter support", "token classification", "speech transcription"], "summary_hash": "a41dd289397f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:36:31+00:00"}
