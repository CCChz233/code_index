{"summary": "The module supplies a collection of diffusion scheduler implementations for generative models, offering a generic base scheduler and concrete algorithms that manage noise schedules, timestep sequences, and sample updates during reverse diffusion. It supports configurable beta/alpha schedules, various prediction strategies, and deterministic or implicit sampling methods.", "business_intent": "Enable developers of medical imaging and other AI applications to integrate efficient, configurable diffusion-based generative sampling into MONAI pipelines, facilitating research and production of high‑quality synthetic data.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "denoising", "generative model", "noise schedule", "timestep", "DDIM", "DDPM", "PNDM", "MONAI", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "869bcc3974f5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:30:02+00:00"}
