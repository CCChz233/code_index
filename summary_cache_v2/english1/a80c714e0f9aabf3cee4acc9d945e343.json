{"summary": "This module defines a set of generic traits for MONAI transforms, providing interfaces and markers for various capabilities such as invertibility, lazy execution, multi-sample generation, randomization, and thread safety. These traits enable developers to create and integrate transforms with specific behaviors and constraints within the MONAI framework.", "business_intent": "The purpose of this module is to establish a standardized way to describe and enforce the capabilities of MONAI transforms, facilitating the development of robust, reusable, and interoperable components for medical imaging pipelines.", "keywords": ["MONAI", "transforms", "traits", "invertibility", "lazy execution", "multi-sample", "randomization", "thread safety", "medical imaging", "pipeline"], "summary_hash": "307bed90b1f9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:04:58+00:00"}
