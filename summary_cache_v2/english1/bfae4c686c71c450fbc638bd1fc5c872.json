{"summary": "This module implements a reference pipeline that integrates Stable Diffusion with ControlNet models, enabling conditional image generation based on auxiliary inputs such as depth maps or edge maps. It demonstrates how to configure, run, and retrieve results from the combined model using the Diffusers library.", "business_intent": "Offer developers a ready‑to‑use example for incorporating ControlNet into Stable Diffusion workflows, accelerating experimentation and adoption of conditional image synthesis capabilities.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "controlnet", "conditional image generation", "diffusers", "reference pipeline", "multi‑controlnet", "torch", "PIL", "example", "community"], "summary_hash": "efe15ad385f6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:00:06+00:00"}
