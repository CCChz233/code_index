{"summary": "The file contains a suite of unit tests that verify Django’s template default filters. It checks that the default‑if‑none filter returns a supplied fallback when the value is None while leaving other values untouched, and that the default filter always treats literal string arguments as safe, bypassing auto‑escaping. Additional tests cover a generic function’s handling of empty, null, and regular inputs.", "business_intent": "Validate the correct behavior of template filters to guarantee that default values are applied safely and that literal strings are not unintentionally escaped, thereby ensuring reliable rendering of web templates.", "keywords": ["Django", "template", "default filter", "default_if_none", "unit testing", "autoescaping", "safe strings", "SimpleTestCase", "mark_safe"], "summary_hash": "ddd08b8e85ac", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:27:27+00:00"}
