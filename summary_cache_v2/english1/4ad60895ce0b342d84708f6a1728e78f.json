{"summary": "The module defines a test suite that rigorously exercises the Kedro CachedDataset implementation. It checks how the dataset processes configuration dictionaries, handles versioned and non‑versioned data, respects copy semantics, manages temporary attributes, verifies existence, loads definitions from YAML, behaves correctly with empty datasets, implements caching logic, supports pickling, releases resources properly, and provides accurate string representations.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correctness of Kedro's cached dataset component to ensure reliable data handling, version control, and performance optimizations in production data pipelines.", "keywords": ["Kedro", "CachedDataset", "DataCatalog", "testing", "versioning", "copy behavior", "temporary attributes", "existence check", "YAML loading", "empty dataset", "caching", "pickle serialization", "resource release", "string representation", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "20123e4e6361", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:19:55+00:00"}
