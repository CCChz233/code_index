{"summary": "Provides utilities to execute generated Python code, assess its correctness, and compute reward signals (e.g., exact‑match) for reinforcement‑learning training of language models. It integrates dataset loading, tokenization, model setup, and PPO training components to enable evaluation and fine‑tuning of code‑generation models.", "business_intent": "Support research and development of AI code‑generation systems by offering a framework that runs generated Python snippets, measures their accuracy, and supplies reward feedback for model improvement through reinforcement learning.", "keywords": ["python interpreter", "code evaluation", "exact match reward", "reinforcement learning", "PPO", "language model", "transformers", "dataset", "model fine‑tuning", "reward function"], "summary_hash": "f69a79cc9f51", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:02:10+00:00"}
