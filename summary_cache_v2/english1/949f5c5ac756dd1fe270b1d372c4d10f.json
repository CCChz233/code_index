{"summary": "The class handles post‑training quantization of NeMo model checkpoints, loading the model with appropriate parallelism, calibrating it to compute scaling factors, and exporting the quantized weights and configuration (as a directory or .qnemo archive) ready for TensorRT‑LLM inference.", "business_intent": "Provide a streamlined workflow to convert high‑precision NeMo language models (especially Llama2) into low‑precision formats (e.g., INT4, FP8) for faster, more cost‑effective serving in production environments.", "keywords": ["post‑training quantization", "NeMo", "low‑precision inference", "INT4", "FP8", "calibration", "TensorRT‑LLM", "model export", "safetensors", "tokenizer config", "parallel model loading", "Llama2"], "summary_hash": "f10c8daca4e4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:13:25+00:00"}
