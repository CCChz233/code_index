{"summary": "This module defines a diffusion pipeline that orchestrates a Stable Diffusion 3 transformer, a scheduler, a VAE, multiple text encoders, and optional ControlNet models to synthesize images from textual prompts and auxiliary conditioning inputs. It manages prompt tokenization, latent space initialization, classifier‑free guidance, and the iterative denoising loop.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to generate high‑quality, controllable images from natural language descriptions and additional signals, supporting customization, fine‑tuning, and integration into AI‑driven creative workflows.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "controlnet", "diffusion pipeline", "text-to-image", "image generation", "classifier-free guidance", "latent diffusion", "VAE", "transformer", "scheduler", "LoRA", "conditioning"], "summary_hash": "99a11ff1a796", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:20:07+00:00"}
