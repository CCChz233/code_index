{"summary": "MetaTensor is a tensor subclass that behaves like a regular PyTorch tensor while carrying an attached metadata dictionary (including optional affine transformation matrices). It automatically propagates or shallow‑copies metadata during tensor operations and provides utilities to query batch status and access metadata as tensors.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless handling of image data together with its descriptive information (e.g., spatial orientation, spacing, patient details) in deep‑learning pipelines, especially for medical imaging, so that transformations and batching preserve the associated metadata without extra bookkeeping.", "keywords": ["torch", "tensor", "metadata", "affine", "batch", "medical imaging", "MONAI", "deep learning", "data provenance"], "summary_hash": "8a9da5a19f64", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:21:45+00:00"}
