{"summary": "Implements a configurable fake BackendV2 that emulates an IBM quantum device using a local simulator. It can generate realistic device characteristics—such as qubit count, basis gates, coupling map, noise models, calibrations, and timing information—either randomly or from supplied specifications, and provides the full BackendV2 interface for transpilation and circuit execution.", "business_intent": "Provide a convenient, realistic simulation environment for developers to test, benchmark, and debug quantum circuits and transpilation workflows without needing access to actual quantum hardware.", "keywords": ["fake backend", "quantum simulator", "device properties", "noise model", "coupling map", "calibration", "Qiskit", "BackendV2", "transpilation", "run simulation"], "summary_hash": "366765a6e1e4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:32:31+00:00"}
