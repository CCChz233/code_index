{"summary": "This module implements a parameterized quantum circuit that performs a Pauli expansion to embed classical data into quantum states. It provides a class that builds the feature map using configurable Pauli strings, repetitions, and entanglement, along with a utility for calculating element‑wise products needed during circuit construction.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑use data‑encoding primitive for quantum machine‑learning workflows, enabling developers to generate feature‑map circuits for quantum kernel methods, variational classifiers, and other algorithms that require classical data to be represented on a quantum processor.", "keywords": ["Pauli feature map", "quantum circuit", "data encoding", "quantum machine learning", "Qiskit", "parameterized circuit", "quantum kernel", "variational algorithm", "NLocal", "quantum data preparation"], "summary_hash": "1b4d7ad5b89f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:16:00+00:00"}
