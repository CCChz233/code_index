{"summary": "A command‑line utility that drives NeMo's multi‑speaker audio simulators to synthesize synthetic speech mixtures (optionally with room impulse responses). It configures and launches the simulation using Hydra, handling multiprocessing setup and invoking either the generic MultiSpeakerSimulator or the RIR‑enhanced variant to produce training data for speech processing models.", "business_intent": "Generate large‑scale, realistic multi‑speaker audio datasets for training and evaluating speech recognition, diarization, or acoustic modeling systems, reducing the need for costly manual recording.", "keywords": ["speech data simulation", "multi‑speaker synthesis", "NeMo", "RIR", "synthetic audio generation", "hydra configuration", "multiprocessing", "training data creation"], "summary_hash": "35eb20314c4c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:23:46+00:00"}
