{"summary": "The module provides a framework for securely hashing and verifying user passwords. It defines an abstract base class for hashers and concrete implementations for various algorithms (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt, PBKDF2, SHA‑1, MD5, UNIX crypt). It also includes utility functions to create password hashes, identify the appropriate hasher, check password validity, and mask hash output.", "business_intent": "Enable Django applications to store user credentials safely by applying industry‑standard password hashing techniques and to verify passwords during authentication while supporting migration from legacy hashing schemes.", "keywords": ["password hashing", "authentication", "Django", "security", "salt", "runtime hardening", "Argon2", "bcrypt", "PBKDF2", "SHA-1", "MD5", "crypt", "hash verification", "legacy support"], "summary_hash": "4f03b2a21302", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:32:39+00:00"}
