{"summary": "Implements the high‑level fit loop used by Lightning PyTorch to drive model training. The loop tracks the number of completed epochs, delegates work to a per‑epoch training loop, and enforces user‑specified constraints such as minimum/maximum epochs, early‑stop criteria, and iteration‑based limits. It also integrates data fetching, progress reporting, and logging utilities.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, configurable training orchestration component that automates the repetitive aspects of model fitting, allowing developers to focus on model architecture and experimentation while ensuring consistent handling of epoch limits, early stopping, and resource management.", "keywords": ["training loop", "epoch management", "early stopping", "iteration limits", "PyTorch Lightning", "fit process", "model training", "progress tracking", "data fetching", "configuration"], "summary_hash": "c49f6d45b400", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:58:59+00:00"}
