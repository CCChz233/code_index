{"summary": "The module supplies a suite of tools for generating synthetic multi‑speaker audio recordings with realistic spatial acoustics. It defines array geometry handling, creates room impulse responses, mixes single‑speaker utterances according to configurable speaker counts, turn‑taking, overlap and noise conditions, applies augmentations, normalizes audio, and writes out audio files and corresponding RTTM/manifest metadata, leveraging parallel processing for scalability.", "business_intent": "To automate the production of large, realistic training and evaluation datasets for automatic speech recognition and diarization systems, especially for far‑field and multi‑microphone scenarios, by simulating rooms, speaker placements, and acoustic effects.", "keywords": ["audio simulation", "multi-speaker mixing", "room impulse response", "array geometry", "speech recognition data generation", "acoustic augmentation", "manifest creation", "parallel processing", "spatial audio", "ASR training data"], "summary_hash": "baa6439f32e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:08:24+00:00"}
