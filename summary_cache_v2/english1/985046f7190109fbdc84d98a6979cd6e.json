{"summary": "Encapsulates the configuration that dictates when and how MODFLOW‑6 model results—heads, cell budgets, and concentrations—are written to listing or binary output files. It accepts static or time‑varying specifications (e.g., first, last, all, or a numeric frequency) for each output type, validates the inputs, resolves file paths, and provides rendering and writing capabilities.", "business_intent": "Provides imod‑python users a flexible, validated interface to schedule model output generation, ensuring that simulation results are saved according to user‑defined timing rules without manual file handling.", "keywords": ["output control", "MODFLOW 6", "head output", "budget output", "concentration output", "frequency", "first/last/all settings", "xarray integration", "validation", "file path resolution", "rendering", "writing"], "summary_hash": "d6963782fd87", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:35:53+00:00"}
