The module also provides lightweight event data classes that encapsulate details like position, velocity, timestamps, and scale factors for each gesture type.", "business_intent": "Allow application developers to easily integrate rich, gesture‑driven interactivity into their Flet interfaces by exposing a reusable detector component and structured event payloads for handling user input.", "keywords": ["gesture detection", "UI control", "event callbacks", "tap", "drag", "scale", "long press", "hover", "scroll", "pointer events", "adaptive layout"], "summary_hash": "0f57109efcec", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:02:44+00:00"}
