{"summary": "This module implements the core of Metaflow’s environment‑escape stubbing mechanism. It defines custom metaclasses that embed a connection object into exception and regular classes, influencing their creation and subclass checks. The main Stub class acts as a local proxy for a remote object, intercepting attribute access and all supported operations and forwarding them to a server via a connection, while a lightweight StubMetaClass supplies a readable string representation. Helper utilities assist in method creation and class construction.", "business_intent": "Provide a transparent way for Metaflow code running in one environment to manipulate objects that actually live in another environment, by creating local proxy objects that forward calls, manage connections, and correctly propagate exceptions.", "keywords": ["stub", "proxy", "remote object", "metaclass", "connection management", "attribute forwarding", "environment escape", "serialization", "pickle", "exception handling"], "summary_hash": "5b349d6d1956", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:12:59+00:00"}
