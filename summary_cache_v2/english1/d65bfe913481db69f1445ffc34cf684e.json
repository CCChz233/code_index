{"summary": "This module provides the training infrastructure for the Würstchen text‑to‑image diffusion model's prior stage. It includes scripts to fine‑tune the prior network either with standard gradient descent or with Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter‑efficient updates, handling argument parsing, dataset loading, caption tokenization, model and LoRA configuration, distributed training via Accelerate, learning‑rate scheduling, periodic validation image generation, checkpoint management, and optional publishing to the Hugging Face Hub. Additionally, it defines an EfficientNet‑based encoder that converts images into compact latent embeddings for use within the diffusion pipeline.", "business_intent": "Allow AI developers and researchers to quickly adapt and improve a state‑of‑the‑art text‑to‑image diffusion model on custom datasets, while minimizing compute and storage costs through LoRA, and facilitating easy sharing of the resulting models on the Hugging Face platform.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "diffusion model", "prior training", "LoRA", "parameter-efficient fine-tuning", "EfficientNet encoder", "Accelerate", "Hugging Face Hub", "checkpointing", "validation generation", "dataset preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "bacf755ab249", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:39:33+00:00"}
