{"summary": "The module defines a loss component for sentence‑transformer models that computes similarity between vector embeddings while caching intermediate results to speed up repeated calculations during training. It also provides a context manager that saves and restores the PyTorch random generator state, guaranteeing deterministic random behavior within a scoped block.", "business_intent": "Accelerate and stabilize training of embedding models by avoiding redundant embedding computations and ensuring reproducible randomness for stochastic operations.", "keywords": ["sentence transformer", "embedding similarity", "cached loss", "training acceleration", "deterministic randomness", "PyTorch", "context manager", "gradient computation"], "summary_hash": "f8e50be3bf30", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:53:51+00:00"}
