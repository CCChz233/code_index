{"summary": "The package supplies tools for visual regression testing of rendered circuit and graph images. It includes functions to extract pixel data, convert images to grayscale, generate diff images, and store reference data, as well as a result class that computes similarity scores, creates visual diffs, and formats the outcome as an HTML snippet for test reports.", "business_intent": "Enable automated detection of visual changes in circuit and graph renderings, providing quantitative similarity metrics and human‑readable diff visualizations to support continuous integration and quality assurance processes.", "keywords": ["visual regression", "image comparison", "pixel extraction", "grayscale conversion", "diff image", "similarity metrics", "HTML report", "test data persistence", "circuit rendering", "graph rendering"], "summary_hash": "38a1758c2375", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:10:15+00:00"}
