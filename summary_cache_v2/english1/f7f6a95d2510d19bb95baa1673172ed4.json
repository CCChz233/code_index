{"summary": "Implements the RadTTS neural text‑to‑speech model, encapsulating the full synthesis pipeline from token sequences to mel‑spectrograms. It integrates attribute prediction (duration, pitch, energy), attention mechanisms, affine and invertible transformations, and a multi‑step flow to generate high‑quality speech representations.", "business_intent": "Provide a configurable, flow‑based TTS solution that enables realistic speech generation with controllable prosodic attributes for applications such as virtual assistants, audiobooks, and voice‑over services.", "keywords": ["text-to-speech", "RadTTS", "flow-based model", "duration prediction", "pitch estimation", "energy modeling", "mel spectrogram", "invertible convolution", "attention", "BiLSTM", "neural module"], "summary_hash": "38a87069f7b9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:55:21+00:00"}
