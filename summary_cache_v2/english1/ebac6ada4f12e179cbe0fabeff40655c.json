{"summary": "This module supplies wrapper classes that adapt Hugging Face transformer models for advanced training scenarios. One wrapper blends the output logits of a primary model with those of a reference model using a geometric mixing coefficient, enabling token sampling from a combined distribution. Another wrapper ensures a pretrained model conforms to the expected PreTrainedModel interface, handling loading, saving, device placement, hub interactions, and reward‑model adapters, thus allowing seamless integration into existing pipelines.", "business_intent": "To streamline reinforcement learning and fine‑tuning workflows for large language models by providing tools that combine model outputs and ensure compatibility with the Hugging Face ecosystem, thereby reducing engineering effort and accelerating deployment of customized AI solutions.", "keywords": ["model wrapper", "logits blending", "geometric mixture", "reference model", "Hugging Face", "PreTrainedModel compatibility", "reinforcement learning", "token generation", "transformer integration", "deep learning utilities"], "summary_hash": "fc39976ccbc3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:01:06+00:00"}
