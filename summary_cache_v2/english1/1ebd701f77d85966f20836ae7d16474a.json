{"summary": "This module provides a suite of unit tests for the unitary synthesis transpiler pass in Qiskit. It defines mock synthesis plugins and lightweight mock extension and plugin managers to simulate the plugin loading mechanism, then validates that the plugin interface correctly handles fallback behavior, propagates configuration options, respects qubit count limits, and registers plugins as expected.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the robustness and extensibility of Qiskit's unitary synthesis plugin framework, ensuring that custom synthesis plugins integrate reliably into the transpilation workflow for quantum circuits.", "keywords": ["unitary synthesis", "transpiler", "plugin", "testing", "mock", "Qiskit", "fallback", "configuration propagation", "qubit constraints", "plugin manager", "extension manager"], "summary_hash": "b2f8870f662f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:48:00+00:00"}
