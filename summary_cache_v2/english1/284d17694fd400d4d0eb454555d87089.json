{"summary": "The module offers a tutorial implementation of a deep generative graph model that builds graphs step‑by‑step by sequentially deciding whether to add a node, which existing node to connect, and the edge destination. It incorporates graph embedding and message‑passing layers, computes action probabilities, and provides distinct forward passes for training and inference, illustrating the DGMG approach.", "business_intent": "Help practitioners and researchers learn how to construct and train deep generative models for graph structures, serving as a reference for applications such as molecular design, network synthesis, and other domains requiring stochastic graph generation.", "keywords": ["generative models", "graph generation", "DGMG", "incremental graph construction", "node addition", "edge selection", "graph embedding", "message passing", "training", "inference", "tutorial", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "3cc1f1bfc166", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:47:30+00:00"}
