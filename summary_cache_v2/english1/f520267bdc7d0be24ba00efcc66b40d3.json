{"summary": "This module provides neural‑network components for graph‑based matrix completion. It defines graph convolution layers that aggregate rating‑specific neighbor information and project it into user/item embeddings, as well as bilinear decoders that convert paired node embeddings into class probability scores using basis‑matrix factorization, dropout, and optional activation functions.", "business_intent": "Supply reusable building blocks for constructing recommendation or link‑prediction systems that rely on graph convolutional matrix completion, helping teams accelerate development of collaborative‑filtering solutions with DGL and PyTorch.", "keywords": ["graph convolution", "matrix completion", "GCMC", "bilinear decoder", "PyTorch", "DGL", "recommendation system", "collaborative filtering", "embedding", "dropout", "activation function"], "summary_hash": "bce2e3f5234a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:53:41+00:00"}
