{"summary": "This module implements a comprehensive pregnancy supervision system for the simulation framework. It tracks each pregnancy from conception through delivery or loss, updates gestational age weekly, assigns probabilities for a range of maternal complications, determines care‑seeking behavior, applies treatment pathways, and records health outcomes such as mortality, stillbirth, and disease burden. The module also defines specialized events for handling ectopic pregnancies, ruptures, gestational diabetes control, syphilis infection, parameter updates, analysis overrides, and yearly logging of aggregated pregnancy statistics.", "business_intent": "To enable detailed modeling of maternal health during pregnancy, allowing analysts and policymakers to evaluate the impact of interventions, resource allocation, and health system performance on pregnancy outcomes and associated disease burden.", "keywords": ["pregnancy simulation", "antenatal care", "maternal complications", "care seeking behavior", "mortality risk", "stillbirth", "disease burden", "DALYs", "event-driven modeling", "health policy analysis"], "summary_hash": "5b5646b1a6f3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:50:49+00:00"}
