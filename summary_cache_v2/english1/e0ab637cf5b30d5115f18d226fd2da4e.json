{"summary": "The file defines lightweight neural model and module stubs equipped with adapter mixins, along with helper utilities for constructing configurations. It provides a reusable test mixin that implements a comprehensive suite of unit tests to verify adapter activation control, forward-pass strategies, multi‑adapter composition, and checkpoint persistence for encoder and decoder components.", "business_intent": "Validate and guarantee the correct behavior of adapter mixin functionality within the NeMo framework, ensuring that models can reliably incorporate and manage adapter modules across training, inference, and serialization workflows.", "keywords": ["adapter", "mixin", "unit testing", "neural module", "model", "activation control", "forward strategy", "composition", "persistence", "configuration", "NeMo", "PyTorch", "Hydra"], "summary_hash": "a88e291efba5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:33:44+00:00"}
