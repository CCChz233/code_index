{"summary": "AlphaBlender is a component that fuses spatial and temporal representations by applying a weighted blending factor. It supports a configurable merge strategy—defaulting to a learned approach using image data—and can optionally invert the order of spatial‑to‑temporal mixing, allowing flexible feature integration for downstream models.", "business_intent": "Enable video‑based AI applications such as action recognition, video classification, and motion analysis to combine image and motion cues more effectively, improving model accuracy and adaptability across different data domains.", "keywords": ["feature fusion", "spatial-temporal blending", "alpha weighting", "configurable merge strategy", "video analysis", "deep learning", "action recognition", "temporal mixing"], "summary_hash": "dd6a792f3cf5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:01:21+00:00"}
