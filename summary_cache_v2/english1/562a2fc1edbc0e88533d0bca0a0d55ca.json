{"summary": "Implements a configurable parallel flow solver based on Krylov subspace iterative methods. It manages outer and inner iteration loops, applies convergence criteria on head change and residuals, supports relaxation and stricter inner tolerances, and selects linear solver and preconditioner options. The solver can partition the computational domain uniformly or via recursive coordinate bisection, optionally using a load‑balance weight grid, and includes flags for deflation preconditioning and debugging.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, scalable simulation of flow models on parallel hardware by providing a flexible, high‑performance Krylov‑based solver that can be tuned for convergence, load distribution, and numerical stability.", "keywords": ["parallel computing", "Krylov subspace", "iterative solver", "flow model", "convergence criteria", "relaxation", "partitioning", "load balancing", "preconditioner", "deflation", "PCG", "ILU", "outer iterations", "inner iterations"], "summary_hash": "3fb0c9a210d5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:33:03+00:00"}
