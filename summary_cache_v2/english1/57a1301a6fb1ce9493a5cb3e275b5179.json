{"summary": "This module implements a configurable textual progress indicator for Dask computations. It provides a progress bar that shows completion percentage, elapsed time, and can be customized in terms of display delay, width, update frequency, and output stream. The bar can be used as a context manager or registered globally to automatically track task progress.", "business_intent": "Enable users to monitor and visualize the execution progress of Dask workloads, facilitating better insight, debugging, and user experience during parallel or distributed processing.", "keywords": ["progress bar", "Dask diagnostics", "textual indicator", "context manager", "global registration", "elapsed time", "percentage completed", "configurable display", "parallel computing monitoring"], "summary_hash": "52b2826f22cc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:21:37+00:00"}
