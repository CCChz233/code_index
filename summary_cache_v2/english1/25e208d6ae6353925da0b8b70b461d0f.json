{"summary": "This module implements a decorator that registers a card generation task for a Metaflow workflow step. It validates card type, identifier and options, manages an optional asynchronous timeout, creates the appropriate card class, and injects the resulting card into the step's runtime context for later access. A helper function provides standardized warning messages.", "business_intent": "Allow Metaflow users to declaratively attach visual or data cards to steps, automating their creation, validation, and integration so that workflow runs can produce rich, consumable reports.", "keywords": ["decorator", "card generation", "Metaflow", "workflow step", "type validation", "identifier pattern", "options handling", "asynchronous timeout", "runtime context integration", "serialization", "component collection"], "summary_hash": "463ee58bbd4f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:09:19+00:00"}
