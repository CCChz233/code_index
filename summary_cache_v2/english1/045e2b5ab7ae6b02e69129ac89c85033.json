{"summary": "A command‑line script that orchestrates the fine‑tuning of a Stable Diffusion XL text‑to‑image model. It loads a dataset, preprocesses captions and images, encodes them with the VAE, sets up the diffusion UNet, optimizer, scheduler and optional EMA, runs the training loop with configurable loss scheduling, and saves checkpoints and a model card.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and developers with a ready‑to‑run pipeline to adapt a large diffusion model to their own text‑image data, enabling domain‑specific image generation and faster deployment of customized generative AI solutions.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "text-to-image", "fine-tuning", "diffusion model", "scheduled huber loss", "training script", "dataset preprocessing", "accelerate", "EMA", "model checkpoint", "huggingface"], "summary_hash": "fd8d44c6b06e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:08:25+00:00"}
