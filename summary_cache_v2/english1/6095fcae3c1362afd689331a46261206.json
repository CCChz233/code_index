{"summary": "Defines an abstract base class that serves as the core interface for precision plugins in Lightning Fabric. The class supplies hooks for converting inputs and outputs, managing module and tensor contexts, performing optimizer steps, applying gradient scaling, and serializing plugin state, enabling flexible handling of numeric precision during model training.", "business_intent": "Provide a modular and extensible framework that allows developers to integrate custom numeric precision strategies (e.g., mixed precision, bfloat16) into deep‑learning training pipelines, improving computational efficiency, memory usage, and hardware utilization.", "keywords": ["precision", "mixed precision", "plugin architecture", "deep learning training", "optimizer step", "gradient scaling", "tensor conversion", "state serialization", "Lightning Fabric", "hardware acceleration"], "summary_hash": "30a6b71da7bd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:05:33+00:00"}
