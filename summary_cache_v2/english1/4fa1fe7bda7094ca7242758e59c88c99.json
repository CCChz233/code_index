{"summary": "Provides a centralized, singleton‑based representation of the execution environment for accelerated training, encapsulating device selection, distributed configuration, process identifiers, precision settings, and gradient‑accumulation behavior. Includes utilities for thread‑local shared storage and simple state‑checking helpers.", "business_intent": "Simplify and standardize the management of hardware resources and distributed training state, allowing developers to write scalable deep‑learning code without manually handling device placement, process coordination, or gradient synchronization across multiple GPUs/TPUs/accelerators.", "keywords": ["accelerator state", "distributed training", "gradient accumulation", "device management", "precision handling", "singleton", "thread‑local storage", "process coordination", "hardware abstraction", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "d87fe3cc22be", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:17:40+00:00"}
