It defines configuration and authentication structures for connecting to a Trino cluster, and provides the core store class that can materialize historical and latest feature data from Trino tables or custom SQL queries. It also includes a retrieval job abstraction that executes Trino queries and returns results as Arrow tables or pandas DataFrames, handling schema extraction and optional result persistence.", "business_intent": "Allow Feast users to leverage Trino as a scalable data warehouse for offline feature engineering, enabling efficient historical feature retrieval and integration with existing Trino‑based data pipelines.", "keywords": ["Trino", "offline feature store", "Feast", "configuration", "authentication", "historical retrieval", "latest feature data", "SQL query execution", "pandas", "pyarrow", "retrieval job", "feature view", "saved dataset"], "summary_hash": "92b8d03b8eab", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:32:14+00:00"}
