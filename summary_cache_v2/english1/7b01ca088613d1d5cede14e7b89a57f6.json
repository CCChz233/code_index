The system tracks each experiment as a Git stash entry or temporary artifact, manages state transitions, provides result and log access, and handles termination and error handling.", "business_intent": "Streamline and automate the execution of data‑science experiments in DVC, allowing users to run, track, and retrieve experiment outcomes reliably and at scale, thereby improving reproducibility and productivity.", "keywords": ["DVC", "experiment queue", "Git stash", "Celery", "asynchronous tasks", "temporary directory", "workspace", "scheduling", "result retrieval", "logging", "cleanup"], "summary_hash": "99e34b7f5f26", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:34:00+00:00"}
