{"summary": "Implements a linear multistep scheduler for diffusion models using discrete beta schedules. It manages configuration parameters such as the number of timesteps, beta range, and prediction type, maintains internal state, scales model inputs, computes LMS coefficients, and updates the sample at each step of the diffusion process.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, configurable scheduler component for Flax/JAX‑based diffusion pipelines, enabling efficient and accurate inference or training by controlling the noise schedule and multi‑step updates.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "linear multistep", "beta schedule", "Flax", "JAX", "noise scaling", "LMS coefficients", "state management", "model input scaling"], "summary_hash": "74e785533c5e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:56:14+00:00"}
