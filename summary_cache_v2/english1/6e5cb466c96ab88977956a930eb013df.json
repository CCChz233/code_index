{"summary": "The module defines core data structures for managing geospatial label information across different computer‑vision tasks such as chip classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. It offers classes to store, compare, filter, and transform label collections, handling both vector geometries and raster masks, and provides utilities like bounding‑box handling, rasterization, and class‑wise statistics.", "business_intent": "To supply a unified, task‑agnostic label handling layer that simplifies the preparation, manipulation, and evaluation of geospatial annotations for machine‑learning pipelines in remote‑sensing and mapping applications.", "keywords": ["geospatial labels", "raster data", "object detection", "semantic segmentation", "chip classification", "bounding boxes", "rasterization", "mask manipulation", "class statistics", "GIS", "machine learning"], "summary_hash": "a094d7620a6c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:05:11+00:00"}
