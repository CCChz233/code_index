{"summary": "The module provides a command‑line entry point that configures, trains, and evaluates a grapheme‑to‑phoneme (G2P) model using NVIDIA NeMo's TTS components. It sets up experiment management, logging, callbacks, and leverages Hydra for configuration handling, then runs the model through PyTorch Lightning training and optional evaluation.", "business_intent": "To facilitate the development of accurate pronunciation models for text‑to‑speech systems, allowing researchers and engineers to quickly train and benchmark G2P models within a reproducible experiment framework.", "keywords": ["G2P", "grapheme to phoneme", "training", "evaluation", "NeMo", "TTS", "Hydra", "PyTorch Lightning", "experiment management", "logging"], "summary_hash": "18cb2d2b681b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:36:23+00:00"}
