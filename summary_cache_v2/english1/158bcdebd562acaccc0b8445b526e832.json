{"summary": "MochiRoPE encapsulates a rotary positional embedding (RoPE) generator that adapts to varying image dimensions by interpolating based on configurable base height and width. It computes position indices, creates the RoPE matrix, and applies it to input tensors during the forward pass.", "business_intent": "Enable the Mochi model to incorporate scalable, high‑quality positional information for visual data, improving performance across different image resolutions.", "keywords": ["rotary positional embedding", "RoPE", "interpolation", "base height", "base width", "positional encoding", "vision transformer", "Mochi model", "forward pass", "tensor transformation"], "summary_hash": "ba3a9d465d9f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:38:54+00:00"}
