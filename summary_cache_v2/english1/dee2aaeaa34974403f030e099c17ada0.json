{"summary": "This module provides a comprehensive test suite that validates the integration of Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters with the CogVideoX diffusion model. It checks inference behavior under various LoRA configurations, verifies correct handling of padding and NaN values, tests scaling options and denoiser interactions, and ensures that LoRA‑augmented pipelines can be saved and reloaded without loss of functionality.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that LoRA fine‑tuning works reliably with CogVideoX, enabling developers to apply low‑rank parameter updates while preserving model correctness and performance for production and research deployments.", "keywords": ["LoRA", "CogVideoX", "diffusion model", "unit testing", "inference", "padding", "NaN handling", "scaling", "denoiser", "model persistence", "PEFT", "low‑rank adaptation"], "summary_hash": "2bf1c3960117", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:47:50+00:00"}
