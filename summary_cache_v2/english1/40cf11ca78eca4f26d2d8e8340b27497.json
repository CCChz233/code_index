{"summary": "Implements the logic for running a service task inside a simulated Step Functions state machine. It builds the request payload, calls the target AWS service through a boto client, converts service errors into Step Functions error names, monitors for cancellation, and synchronizes the task's output, including handling callbacks and task‑token based waiting.", "business_intent": "Allow the Moto Step Functions parser to faithfully emulate service‑task execution, error propagation, and result handling so that state machine simulations behave like real AWS Step Functions workflows.", "keywords": ["Step Functions", "service task", "execution simulation", "parameter preparation", "error conversion", "boto client", "termination monitoring", "result synchronization", "callback handling", "task token"], "summary_hash": "3015e9faa632", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:12:10+00:00"}
