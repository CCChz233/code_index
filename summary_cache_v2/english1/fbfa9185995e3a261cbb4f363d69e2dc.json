{"summary": "Defines a high‑level diffusion pipeline that performs unconditional image generation by encoding inputs into a latent space with a vector‑quantized VAE, iteratively denoising the latents using a UNet model guided by a DDIM scheduler, and finally decoding the latents back into images.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to generate images without any conditioning prompts, facilitating creative exploration, prototyping of generative models, and integration of latent diffusion capabilities into applications.", "keywords": ["latent diffusion", "unconditional generation", "VAE", "vector‑quantized", "UNet", "DDIM scheduler", "DiffusionPipeline", "image synthesis", "latent space", "encoding", "decoding"], "summary_hash": "ba05cccfa139", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:44:20+00:00"}
