{"summary": "This module implements the storage layer for Certbot-managed TLS certificates. It defines a class that represents a certificate lineage, tracking the current certificate, private key, chain, and fullchain files via symbolic links, and provides methods to inspect, update, and rotate these assets. The module also contains helper utilities for constructing file paths, handling renewal configuration files, and managing archived versions of certificates on the filesystem.", "business_intent": "Enable automated acquisition and renewal of TLS certificates by reliably persisting certificate files, private keys, and related metadata, while supporting versioned archives and configurable renewal settings for seamless integration with Certbot's ACME workflow.", "keywords": ["certificate", "renewal", "storage", "lineage", "symlink", "private key", "chain", "fullchain", "archive", "configuration", "filesystem", "Certbot", "ACME", "TLS"], "summary_hash": "7a222081a4d8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:08:52+00:00"}
