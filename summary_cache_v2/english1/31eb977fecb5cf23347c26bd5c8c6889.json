{"summary": "This module orchestrates the training and evaluation pipeline for a diffusion-based temporal graph recurrent neural network applied to traffic speed forecasting. It prepares graph-structured traffic datasets, constructs the model with diffusion convolution and gated attention layers, configures data loaders, loss functions, and learning rate schedules, and runs the optimization loop while tracking performance metrics.", "business_intent": "Enable the development and benchmarking of advanced spatiotemporal graph neural networks for predicting traffic conditions on road networks, supporting datasets such as METR-LA and PEMS-BAY.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "DGL", "graph neural network", "traffic forecasting", "diffusion convolution", "gated attention", "training loop", "evaluation", "masked MAE loss", "normalization", "METR-LA", "PEMS-BAY"], "summary_hash": "abf68fc28d92", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:20:24+00:00"}
