{"summary": "Provides a dataset class that transforms raw Schema‑Guided Dialogue (SGD) turns into BERT‑ready tensors. It reads the original JSON files, tokenizes utterances with a BERT tokenizer, aligns sub‑word pieces with slot annotations, builds input IDs, attention masks and token‑type IDs, and optionally attaches intent and slot label indices so that downstream BERT models can be trained or evaluated for intent detection and slot filling.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the development and evaluation of BERT‑based natural‑language understanding models for conversational AI, specifically for intent classification and slot‑value extraction in schema‑guided dialogue systems.", "keywords": ["BERT", "dialogue dataset", "Schema-Guided Dialogue", "intent detection", "slot filling", "tokenization", "subword alignment", "NLP preprocessing", "PyTorch dataset"], "summary_hash": "1100f0ebdaa0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:32:42+00:00"}
