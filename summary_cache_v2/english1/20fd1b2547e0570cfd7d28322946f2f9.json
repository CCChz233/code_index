{"summary": "This module implements a suite of neural machine translation models for the NeMo framework, covering a Megatron‑scaled transformer, a configurable encoder‑decoder, and an encoder‑decoder with a bottleneck latent space. Each model integrates data handling, tokenization, model assembly, training and validation loops, loss and metric computation (including BLEU), and inference/export capabilities with support for multilingual setups and diverse decoding strategies.", "business_intent": "To enable developers and enterprises to build, train, evaluate, and deploy high‑performance, scalable translation systems—ranging from large‑scale Megatron models to research‑oriented architectures with latent bottlenecks—facilitating multilingual translation services and integration into production pipelines.", "keywords": ["neural machine translation", "encoder-decoder", "Megatron", "multilingual", "BLEU", "beam search", "top‑k sampling", "latent bottleneck", "variational autoencoder", "data loading", "inference", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "419658421b68", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:10:45+00:00"}
