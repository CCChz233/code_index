{"summary": "This module defines a Future abstraction that represents the execution of a Prefect task, exposing methods to inspect its state, wait for completion, and retrieve the computed value. It also provides utilities for traversing arbitrary data structures to locate futures and replace them with their resolved results or states, facilitating seamless integration of asynchronous task outcomes into user code.", "business_intent": "Enable Prefect workflows to manage and query asynchronous task runs, allowing developers to treat task executions as first‑class objects, wait for their completion, and automatically materialize their results or states within complex data structures.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "Future", "task execution", "state inspection", "asynchronous", "result resolution", "nested data structures", "concurrency", "awaitable", "orchestration"], "summary_hash": "d331111e97c8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:24:38+00:00"}
