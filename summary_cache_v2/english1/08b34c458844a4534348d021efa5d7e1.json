{"summary": "This module implements low‑level primitives for attention mechanisms, focusing on efficient sparse batch matrix multiplication and related utilities such as masked multiplication, softmax, dropout handling, and scaled dot‑product calculations. It provides a class that manages forward and backward passes for sparse BMM, while the remaining functions serve as auxiliary helpers for various attention‑related operations.", "business_intent": "Enable faster and more memory‑efficient transformer models by supplying optimized sparse attention kernels that reduce computational overhead and support advanced attention patterns.", "keywords": ["attention", "sparse matrix multiplication", "batch matrix multiplication", "scaled dot product", "softmax", "dropout", "masking", "PyTorch", "performance optimization", "transformer"], "summary_hash": "077b0a6d2442", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:31:45+00:00"}
