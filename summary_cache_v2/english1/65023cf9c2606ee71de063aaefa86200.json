{"summary": "The module implements dataset utilities for training T5‑style language models within the Megatron framework. It defines a mock dataset for generating synthetic samples and a full dataset class that reads raw text, selects an appropriate SentencePiece tokenizer, creates tokenized training examples with masking and padding, and outputs the data as NumPy arrays ready for PyTorch data loaders.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use data pipeline that prepares and serves tokenized, masked, and padded T5 training samples, facilitating efficient large‑scale language model training and evaluation.", "keywords": ["T5", "dataset", "language modeling", "tokenization", "masked language modeling", "Megatron", "PyTorch", "NumPy", "SentencePiece", "synthetic data", "mock dataset"], "summary_hash": "aa20ff4a9264", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:29:57+00:00"}
