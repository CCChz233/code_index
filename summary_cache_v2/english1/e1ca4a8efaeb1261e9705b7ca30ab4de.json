{"summary": "A unit‑test module that validates the implementation of regression metrics (MAE, MSE, PSNR, RMSE) provided by the MONAI library. It defines lightweight NumPy‑based reference functions and a test suite that compares MONAI metric outputs against these references across different tensor shapes, checks handling of mismatched dimensions, and confirms correct behavior for identical inputs.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of regression evaluation components used in medical imaging AI workflows, supporting quality assurance and continuous integration testing.", "keywords": ["regression metrics", "unit testing", "MONAI", "MAE", "MSE", "PSNR", "RMSE", "numpy", "torch", "determinism", "shape validation", "unittest"], "summary_hash": "25b7031eac41", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:55:15+00:00"}
