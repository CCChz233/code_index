{"summary": "Provides a unified framework for persisting and accessing annotation data across computer‑vision tasks. It defines an abstract label store interface, configuration helpers, and concrete implementations that read/write labels in GeoJSON or raster formats for chip classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, along with utilities for format conversion.", "business_intent": "Facilitates reliable storage, retrieval, and update of ground‑truth and prediction labels within Raster Vision pipelines, allowing seamless integration of GIS‑compatible formats and raster data for model training and inference.", "keywords": ["label store", "GeoJSON", "raster", "chip classification", "object detection", "semantic segmentation", "configuration", "protobuf", "GIS", "prediction", "training", "data pipeline"], "summary_hash": "98922bc3695d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:04:55+00:00"}
