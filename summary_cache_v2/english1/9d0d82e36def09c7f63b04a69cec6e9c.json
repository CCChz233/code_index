{"summary": "The module provides example scripts that demonstrate how to fine‑tune causal language models using the RLOO (Reinforcement Learning with Offline Optimization) algorithm from the TRL library. One script shows a generic workflow: parsing arguments, loading a dataset, tokenizing, configuring models and training parameters, and running the RLOOTrainer. The second script adapts this workflow for a TLDR summarization task, preparing a summarization dataset, tokenizing inputs and references, and training a language model together with a reward model via the RLOOTrainer.", "business_intent": "Offer ready‑to‑run examples that enable users to apply reinforcement learning from offline data to improve large language models, including a concrete TLDR summarization use case, thereby facilitating better model alignment and generation quality.", "keywords": ["RLOO", "reinforcement learning", "offline optimization", "language model fine-tuning", "TRL", "Hugging Face", "datasets", "tokenization", "summarization", "TLDR", "reward model", "accelerate", "transformers"], "summary_hash": "cd70587a1bda", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:03:53+00:00"}
