{"summary": "Implements a transformation that extracts a central region from an image, where the region size is defined as a proportion of the original dimensions. The scale can be specified per dimension or uniformly, and the operation can be performed lazily to postpone actual pixel manipulation.", "business_intent": "Facilitates image preprocessing in computer‑vision workflows by providing a configurable central crop, enabling consistent input sizing and optional lazy execution for performance optimization.", "keywords": ["center crop", "scale", "region of interest", "image preprocessing", "lazy execution", "computer vision", "data augmentation", "transform"], "summary_hash": "d968aa389def", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:03:03+00:00"}
