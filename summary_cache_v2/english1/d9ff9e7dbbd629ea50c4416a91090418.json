{"summary": "The module defines a unified interface for submitting and managing shell‑script jobs across different workload managers (local execution, GridEngine, HTCondor). It includes an error class to encapsulate job execution failures and a manager class that abstracts submission details, supports a test mode, and logs operations.", "business_intent": "To simplify and standardize how simulation tools launch computational jobs on various batch systems, providing consistent job handling, error reporting, and optional testing without requiring direct interaction with each workload manager.", "keywords": ["job management", "workload manager", "GridEngine", "HTCondor", "job submission", "error handling", "test mode", "simulation tools", "batch system", "abstraction"], "summary_hash": "83d24bdf8a38", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:52:05+00:00"}
