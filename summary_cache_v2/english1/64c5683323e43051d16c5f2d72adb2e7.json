It also supports slicing, yielding a Subset object.", "business_intent": "Facilitate joint loading of related data streams (e.g., images with masks, audio with transcripts) in a single data pipeline, simplifying multi‑task or multi‑modal model training.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "Dataset", "zip", "tuple", "flatten", "synchronization", "multi-modal", "subset", "slicing", "data loading"], "summary_hash": "82c48c6b7579", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:20:03+00:00"}
