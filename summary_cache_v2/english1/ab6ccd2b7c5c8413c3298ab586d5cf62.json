{"summary": "Provides unit tests that verify the inverse collation behavior of MONAI random image transformations when the transformation probability is set to deterministic extremes (0 or 1). The tests construct 2‑D and 3‑D synthetic images, apply a series of random augmentations via a DataLoader, and assert that the decollated and inverse‑collated outputs match the expected original data.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the data preprocessing pipeline for medical imaging maintains data integrity and reproducibility when random augmentations are forced to be always applied or never applied, by validating the inverse collation mechanism.", "keywords": ["unit test", "inverse collation", "random augmentation", "probability 0", "probability 1", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "data loader", "cache dataset", "deterministic transforms"], "summary_hash": "393f4844938a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:55:37+00:00"}
