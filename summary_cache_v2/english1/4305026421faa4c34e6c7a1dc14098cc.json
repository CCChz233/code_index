{"summary": "A configuration container that encapsulates all hyperparameters required to build a Decision Transformer model for reinforcement learning, including environment state and action dimensions, transformer architecture details (layers, heads, hidden size, feed‑forward size, activation), dropout rates, normalization settings, and GPT‑2 vocabulary specifications. It inherits from the generic pretrained configuration class to integrate seamlessly with the model initialization pipeline.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to define, adjust, and persist the architectural and training settings of a Decision Transformer model so it can be instantiated with the desired RL environment specifications and transformer characteristics without manually handling low‑level model code.", "keywords": ["decision transformer", "configuration", "reinforcement learning", "transformer hyperparameters", "GPT-2 backbone", "state dimension", "action dimension", "hidden size", "dropout", "attention heads", "layer normalization", "model initialization"], "summary_hash": "95868cf56863", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:45:26+00:00"}
