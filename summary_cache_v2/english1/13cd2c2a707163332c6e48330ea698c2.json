{"summary": "This module prepares and integrates bathymetric/topographic data into a ROMS model grid. It retrieves elevation datasets, computes the r‑factor for grid steepness, applies global and local smoothing, adds the processed topography to the model dataset, and attaches relevant metadata.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate and stable ocean model simulations by providing high‑resolution, properly smoothed bathymetry with necessary metadata for the ROMS framework.", "keywords": ["bathymetry", "topography", "ROMS", "grid smoothing", "r-factor", "elevation datasets", "metadata", "ocean modeling"], "summary_hash": "14611b2ce135", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:15:38+00:00"}
