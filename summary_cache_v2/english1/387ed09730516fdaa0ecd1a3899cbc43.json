{"summary": "Defines a command‑line driven training routine for a graph neural network explainer using DGL synthetic datasets. It parses arguments, loads a selected dataset, constructs the model, runs the training loop with PyTorch, and saves the trained graphs and checkpoints.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers or developers to quickly train and evaluate GNN explainability models on benchmark graph datasets, facilitating experimentation and integration of explainable AI capabilities into graph‑based products.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "explainer", "DGL", "synthetic graph datasets", "training script", "PyTorch", "command line interface", "model checkpoint", "graph classification"], "summary_hash": "e4c8a61b14eb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:16:35+00:00"}
