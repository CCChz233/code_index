{"summary": "This module provides a suite of test cases and helper utilities that exercise various Python language features, including positional‑only arguments, name‑mangling for private members, optional and keyword arguments, argument unpacking, closures, async functions, generators, lambdas, and object serialization with pickle. It also defines lightweight classes offering simple methods to return tuples and demonstrate private attribute access.", "business_intent": "To validate that the project's runtime (including Cython‑compiled components) correctly implements and enforces advanced Python syntax and semantics, ensuring reliable behavior across serialization, function calling conventions, and language feature handling.", "keywords": ["positional-only arguments", "name mangling", "private members", "optional arguments", "keyword arguments", "argument unpacking", "closures", "async functions", "generators", "lambdas", "serialization", "pickle", "testing", "Cython"], "summary_hash": "b175868e62c9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:22:32+00:00"}
