{"summary": "The module supplies helper utilities for arranging the visual representation of quantum pulse schedules. It includes logic to group and sort channels, produce default figure titles, and translate time windows into nanosecond axis specifications, all driven by formatter and backend device information.", "business_intent": "To give users and developers fine‑grained control over the layout of pulse‑level visualizations—such as channel ordering, horizontal time axis scaling, and figure titles—so that plots can be tailored to specific hardware configurations and presentation needs.", "keywords": ["quantum pulse visualization", "layout utilities", "channel ordering", "time axis mapping", "figure title generation", "backend device info", "customizable plots", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "0504594c9854", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:02:24+00:00"}
