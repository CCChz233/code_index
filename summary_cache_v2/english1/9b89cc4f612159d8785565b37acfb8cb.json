{"summary": "The module implements utilities for calculating zonal statistics, such as zonal means, on data defined over unstructured grids. It handles both area‑weighted (conservative) and simple (non‑conservative) averaging, leverages Dask for scalable computation, and uses grid‑specific face‑weight and geometry helpers to correctly aggregate values across latitude bands.", "business_intent": "To provide scientists and analysts with efficient, scalable tools for aggregating geophysical variables along latitude circles in large, unstructured‑grid datasets, supporting high‑performance workflows in climate and ocean modeling.", "keywords": ["zonal mean", "unstructured grid", "area weighting", "conservative averaging", "non-conservative averaging", "Dask", "parallel computation", "grid integration", "latitude aggregation", "climate data analysis"], "summary_hash": "2d735e2347ad", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:28:35+00:00"}
