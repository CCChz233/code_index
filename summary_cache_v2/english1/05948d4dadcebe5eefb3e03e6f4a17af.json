{"summary": "The component assigns a special 'unknown' sentinel as the result for task or flow runs that are forced into a completed state after a failure or crash, especially when the prior state had a persisted result. This sentinel allows the system to differentiate between runs that truly have a result and those that were completed artificially, preventing unnecessary reruns during flow retries and avoiding exceptions when accessing results.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable retry logic and result handling by marking artificially completed runs with an identifiable unknown result, ensuring they are not mistakenly re-executed or cause errors when their results are queried.", "keywords": ["unknown sentinel", "forced completion", "result handling", "flow run retry", "task run retry", "persisted result", "state transition", "error avoidance"], "summary_hash": "ff6aceda4e4c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:46:46+00:00"}
