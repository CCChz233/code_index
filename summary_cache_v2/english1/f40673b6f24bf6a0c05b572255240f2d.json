{"summary": "A transform that injects configurable additive noise into image channels. It supports multiple probability distributions (uniform, Gaussian, Laplace, Beta) and three spatial generation modes—single value per channel, a shared noise map for all channels, or independent per‑pixel noise—while allowing resolution approximation to trade speed for quality.", "business_intent": "Enable realistic and diverse noise‑based data augmentation for computer‑vision pipelines, helping models become robust to sensor imperfections, lighting variations, and other stochastic disturbances.", "keywords": ["additive noise", "image augmentation", "random perturbation", "probability distribution", "uniform", "gaussian", "laplace", "beta", "spatial mode", "constant per channel", "shared map", "per‑pixel", "approximation", "robustness", "data augmentation"], "summary_hash": "5d464991a553", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:20:20+00:00"}
