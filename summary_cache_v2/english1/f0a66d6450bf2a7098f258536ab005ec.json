{"summary": "A data‑augmentation transform that randomly selects a subset of object instances identified in a single‑channel mask and removes them from both the image and the mask, optionally filling the emptied regions with a constant value or inpainting, while also updating or discarding related bounding boxes and keypoints based on configurable area and visibility thresholds.", "business_intent": "To increase model robustness to occlusions and missing objects by exposing training data to realistic object dropout scenarios, thereby improving performance of segmentation, detection, and pose‑estimation systems in real‑world conditions.", "keywords": ["object dropout", "mask augmentation", "occlusion simulation", "image segmentation", "bounding box adjustment", "keypoint adjustment", "data augmentation", "inpainting", "random object removal", "training robustness"], "summary_hash": "2fd656f0e947", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:24:44+00:00"}
