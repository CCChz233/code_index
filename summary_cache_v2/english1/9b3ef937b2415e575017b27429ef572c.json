{"summary": "Provides a generic framework for performing bottom‑up transformations on a forest of parse nodes. It defines hook points for different node categories (intermediate, packed, symbol, token) that can be overridden in subclasses to compute new values from child results, with support for discarding nodes.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to create custom tree or parse‑forest processing pipelines such as code analysis, compilation, data extraction, or format conversion by extending the base class and implementing specific transformation logic.", "keywords": ["bottom-up transformation", "parse forest", "tree traversal", "visitor pattern", "subclassing", "AST manipulation", "node aggregation", "discardable nodes", "compiler tooling", "language processing"], "summary_hash": "ce1de7af3cf4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:14:38+00:00"}
