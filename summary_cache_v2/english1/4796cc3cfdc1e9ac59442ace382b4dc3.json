{"summary": "The module implements a connector that links the trainer's lifecycle events (batch start/end, epoch start/end, fit start, etc.) with one or more logging backends. It gathers metric outputs, converts tensors to scalars, aggregates values across distributed processes, updates progress‑bar dictionaries, and forwards the results to configured loggers such as TensorBoard or CSV. It also manages logger initialization, state resets, and compatibility with environments like SLURM.", "business_intent": "Provide a unified, configurable logging layer for PyTorch Lightning training pipelines so that users can automatically record, visualize, and persist metrics and progress information across different logging platforms, improving experiment tracking, debugging, and reproducibility.", "keywords": ["logging", "metric aggregation", "trainer hooks", "PyTorch Lightning", "TensorBoard", "CSVLogger", "progress bar", "distributed training", "SLURM", "rank zero", "scalar conversion"], "summary_hash": "4cee41a86c2b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:01:00+00:00"}
