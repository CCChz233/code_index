{"summary": "Defines a high‑level class that represents a MODFLOW‑6 groundwater model, encapsulating its spatial domain, hydraulic parameters, and the collection of MODFLOW packages. The class offers methods to initialize, update, validate, and render the model, as well as to perform spatial operations such as clipping, regridding, and splitting, and to manage temporal settings and output generation.", "business_intent": "Enable users to programmatically construct, modify, validate, and export MODFLOW‑6 models within the IMOD ecosystem, streamlining the workflow for groundwater simulation setup, spatial data integration, and result production.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW-6", "groundwater modeling", "model management", "spatial domain", "hydraulic properties", "package handling", "validation", "regridding", "clipping", "splitting", "time handling", "output generation", "Python", "xarray", "jinja2", "horizontal flow barrier", "well representation", "IMOD"], "summary_hash": "e651faa7b01f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:49:14+00:00"}
