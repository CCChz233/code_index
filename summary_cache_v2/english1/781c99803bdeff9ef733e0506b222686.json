{"summary": "Implements a GPU‑only relational graph convolution layer for PyTorch, using cuGraph‑ops to perform high‑throughput edge‑type specific aggregation. The module includes a custom autograd operation for forward and backward passes and supports basis‑decomposition regularization, optional bias, activation functions, self‑loops, dropout, and layer‑norm to transform node features according to edge types.", "business_intent": "Accelerate training and inference of graph neural networks on large heterogeneous graphs by providing a high‑performance, GPU‑accelerated relational convolution primitive, enabling faster development of applications such as recommendation systems, fraud detection, and knowledge‑graph embeddings.", "keywords": ["relational graph convolution", "cuGraph-ops", "GPU", "PyTorch", "graph neural network", "aggregation", "basis decomposition", "layer normalization", "dropout", "self-loop", "custom autograd"], "summary_hash": "0e7b9be57355", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:46:32+00:00"}
