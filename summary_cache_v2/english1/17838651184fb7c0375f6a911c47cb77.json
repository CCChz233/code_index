{"summary": "This module prepares graph data for distributed partitioning with ParMETIS. It reads raw graph structures and node attributes, generates per‑process edge and node‑weight files, assembles the command‑line arguments required by ParMETIS, and provides utilities for extracting process information and node features.", "business_intent": "Facilitate scalable, balanced graph partitioning for distributed machine‑learning workloads, enabling efficient parallel training or inference across multiple compute nodes.", "keywords": ["graph partitioning", "ParMETIS", "preprocessing", "edge files", "node weights", "distributed computing", "process information", "node features", "PyArrow", "torch.distributed"], "summary_hash": "ab851dfea630", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:59:10+00:00"}
