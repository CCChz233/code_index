{"summary": "A configuration container for a depth estimation model that encapsulates architectural choices such as backbone selection, patch size, hidden dimensions, up/down‑sampling factors, and whether to load pretrained backbone weights. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate a DepthAnything model with the specified settings.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to easily customize and reproduce depth estimation models by specifying model architecture parameters and backbone options in a single, serializable object.", "keywords": ["depth estimation", "model configuration", "backbone", "pretrained weights", "patch size", "hidden size", "reassemble layers", "fusion", "architecture", "HuggingFace"], "summary_hash": "53beec7f521a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:30:06+00:00"}
