{"summary": "Implements a Byte‑Pair‑Encoding tokenizer tailored for the PhoBERT model, managing a vocabulary and merge rules, handling special tokens (CLS, SEP, BOS, EOS, PAD, UNK, MASK), and providing conversion between text, token strings, and integer IDs. It also assembles token sequences with appropriate special tokens and token‑type IDs for various downstream tasks.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable preprocessing of Vietnamese text for PhoBERT‑based applications such as text classification, question answering, and masked language modeling.", "keywords": ["tokenizer", "Byte-Pair Encoding", "PhoBERT", "Vietnamese NLP", "special tokens", "vocabulary", "token‑id mapping", "sequence construction", "padding", "masking"], "summary_hash": "6d5b711f3d56", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:31:14+00:00"}
