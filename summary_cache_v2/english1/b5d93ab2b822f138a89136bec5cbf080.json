{"summary": "The module defines abstract interfaces and manager classes for unitary and high‑level synthesis plugins used by Qiskit’s transpiler. It handles registration and discovery of external synthesis implementations via setuptools entry points and provides utilities to query available plugins, enabling users to extend the transpilation flow with custom synthesis algorithms.", "business_intent": "To provide a stable, extensible plugin system that lets third‑party packages contribute new quantum circuit synthesis techniques, allowing the Qiskit transpiler to automatically discover and employ these methods during circuit compilation.", "keywords": ["plugin", "synthesis", "quantum circuit", "transpiler", "extensibility", "entry points", "unitary", "high‑level", "manager", "discovery"], "summary_hash": "e8c4829963e4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:25:40+00:00"}
