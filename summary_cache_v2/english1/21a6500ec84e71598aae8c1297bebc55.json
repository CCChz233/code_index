{"summary": "Utility that performs patch‑wise inference for the HoVerNet model using a sliding‑window strategy. It divides input volumes into configurable ROI windows, processes a batch of windows per model forward pass, blends overlapping predictions with constant or Gaussian weighting, manages padding and device placement, and can switch stitching to CPU to reduce GPU memory consumption.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, memory‑efficient inference solution for large histopathology images, enabling reliable HoVerNet segmentation in clinical and research pipelines without exceeding hardware limits.", "keywords": ["sliding window", "HoVerNet", "inference", "patch-based", "overlapping", "blending", "Gaussian weighting", "padding", "device management", "CPU stitching", "memory optimization", "medical imaging", "segmentation"], "summary_hash": "4ac4f4f337b3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:25:54+00:00"}
