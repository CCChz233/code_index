{"summary": "A collection of utilities and an example pipeline for applying geometric deep learning to graph‑based tasks. It includes tools for graph coarsening, coordinate handling, and synthetic grid‑graph generation, and demonstrates how to convert MNIST images into graphs and train graph neural networks (Chebyshev and MoNet layers) for digit classification using PyTorch and DGL.", "business_intent": "Showcase and simplify the adoption of graph neural network techniques for image classification and other graph‑structured data problems, providing reference code that illustrates model definition, data preprocessing, training, and evaluation within the DGL ecosystem.", "keywords": ["geometric deep learning", "graph neural network", "graph classification", "Chebyshev convolution", "MoNet", "MNIST", "PyTorch", "DGL", "graph coarsening", "grid graph", "coordinate processing"], "summary_hash": "fc75124eea18", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:56:11+00:00"}
