{"summary": "The module provides a suite of unit tests that verify the behavior of Dask bag's random sampling utilities, including choice selection, simple sampling, reservoir sampling, and weighted sampling without replacement. The tests exercise edge conditions such as empty partitions, sample sizes exceeding the bag or partition sizes, unbalanced partition distributions, and exact-size matches, ensuring the algorithms function correctly across diverse partition configurations.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the reliability and statistical correctness of random sampling operations in Dask's distributed bag abstraction, thereby supporting accurate data analysis and machine‑learning workflows that depend on random draws from large, partitioned datasets.", "keywords": ["dask", "bag", "random sampling", "unit tests", "choices", "sample", "reservoir sampling", "weighted sampling", "partition edge cases", "distributed data processing"], "summary_hash": "c829239e9069", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:24:03+00:00"}
