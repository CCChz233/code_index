{"summary": "The module demonstrates how to set up and run a text classification training pipeline with checkpointing support using the Accelerate library. It loads a dataset, tokenizes the text, creates training and evaluation dataloaders, configures a model, optimizer, and learning‑rate scheduler, and orchestrates training and evaluation while handling distributed environments and saving/restoring checkpoints.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example that helps developers understand and adopt Accelerate’s checkpointing capabilities for robust, reproducible model training in production or research settings.", "keywords": ["accelerate", "checkpointing", "distributed training", "transformers", "sequence classification", "tokenization", "dataloader", "optimizer", "learning rate scheduler", "evaluation", "PyTorch", "example script"], "summary_hash": "efcb5415b073", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:17:01+00:00"}
