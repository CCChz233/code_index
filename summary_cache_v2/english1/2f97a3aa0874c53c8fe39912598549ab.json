{"summary": "Provides the low‑level serialization and deserialization logic for QuantumCircuit objects in Qiskit's QPY binary format. It defines helpers to encode and decode circuit metadata, registers, instructions, parameters, layouts, calibrations, custom operations, and control‑flow constructs, enabling efficient storage and transport of quantum circuits.", "business_intent": "Facilitate fast, reliable persistence and exchange of quantum circuit definitions across Qiskit components and external tools by converting them to a compact binary representation and reconstructing them when needed.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "QPY", "binary serialization", "quantum circuit", "read", "write", "instruction", "register", "layout", "calibration", "custom operation", "control flow", "parameter", "modifier"], "summary_hash": "1b727cd29429", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:08:46+00:00"}
