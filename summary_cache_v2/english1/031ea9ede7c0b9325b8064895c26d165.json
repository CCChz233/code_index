{"summary": "Offers a high‑level interface to the Primer3 command‑line tool, handling a reference genome file and its sequence dictionary to generate PCR primer pairs. It creates design regions, builds oligos, assembles single and paired designs, screens results, tracks failures, and provides the final primer sequences while managing resources and errors.", "business_intent": "Streamline and automate the creation of reliable primer sequences for target genomic regions, supporting molecular biology and diagnostic workflows that require precise PCR primer design.", "keywords": ["Primer3", "primer design", "PCR", "genomic reference", "sequence dictionary", "oligo assembly", "design region", "error handling", "bioinformatics", "command line integration"], "summary_hash": "c546a9426dc3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:09:05+00:00"}
