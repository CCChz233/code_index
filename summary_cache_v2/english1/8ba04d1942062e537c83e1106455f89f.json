{"summary": "Implements flexible beam-search decoding for RNN‑Transducer speech models, supporting multiple strategies (standard beam, time‑synchronous, alignment‑length synchronous, and modified adaptive expansion). Configurable beam size, score normalization, hypothesis output mode, alignment preservation, and optional N‑gram language model weighting allow fine‑tuned trade‑offs between speed, memory, and transcription accuracy.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑accuracy, configurable inference decoding in speech‑recognition pipelines, giving developers control over latency and resource usage while delivering optimal transcription results for production or research deployments.", "keywords": ["beam search", "RNN‑Transducer", "speech recognition decoding", "time synchronous decoding", "alignment length synchronous decoding", "adaptive expansion search", "hypothesis ranking", "N‑gram language model integration", "score normalization", "hypothesis alignment preservation"], "summary_hash": "d158b285e2c7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:28:01+00:00"}
