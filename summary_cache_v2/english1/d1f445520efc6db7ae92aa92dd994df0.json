{"summary": "The module supplies a comprehensive data pipeline for token‑level classification tasks such as punctuation and capitalization restoration. It includes training datasets that load, tokenize, map labels, create masks and segment IDs, and support efficient batch construction with multiprocessing; an inference dataset that converts raw text into overlapping BERT‑compatible segments; a tarred‑dataset variant that streams samples from compressed archives with shuffling and shard distribution; and shared utilities for label handling, weight computation, and preprocessing.", "business_intent": "Facilitate fast and scalable training and deployment of BERT‑style models that restore punctuation and capitalization in text, by providing ready‑to‑use, memory‑efficient datasets and preprocessing tools.", "keywords": ["token classification", "punctuation restoration", "capitalization restoration", "BERT", "dataset", "inference", "streaming", "tarred dataset", "tokenization", "label mapping", "balanced training", "multiprocessing", "mask generation"], "summary_hash": "f906bd56a231", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:09:38+00:00"}
