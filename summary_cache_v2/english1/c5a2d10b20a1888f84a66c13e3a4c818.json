{"summary": "Defines a parameterized quantum circuit template that implements a CX‑like operation using an RZX gate surrounded by single‑qubit RZ and RX rotations. The circuit is built with Qiskit primitives and accepts a rotation angle as a symbolic parameter.", "business_intent": "Offer a reusable building block for constructing controlled‑X operations from native RZX interactions, enabling hardware‑friendly gate synthesis and optimization in quantum algorithms.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "RZX gate", "CX decomposition", "parameterized circuit", "Qiskit", "gate synthesis", "hardware native gates", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "5b4323513b3e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:20:57+00:00"}
