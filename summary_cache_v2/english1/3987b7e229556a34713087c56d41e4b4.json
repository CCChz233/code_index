{"summary": "This module defines a command‑line training pipeline for an unconditional diffusion model (DDPM) using a UNet architecture. It parses configuration options, loads an image dataset, constructs the model and diffusion scheduler, wraps the model with ONNX Runtime's ORTModule and FP16 optimizer, and runs distributed training via Accelerate. It also manages logging, checkpointing, and optional upload to the Hugging Face hub.", "business_intent": "Provide a reference implementation that demonstrates how to accelerate unconditional image generation model training with ONNX Runtime, enabling faster experimentation and production‑ready pipelines for AI developers and researchers.", "keywords": ["ONNX Runtime", "diffusion model", "DDPM", "unconditional image generation", "training script", "Accelerate", "mixed precision", "distributed training", "Hugging Face", "checkpointing", "logging", "UNet2DModel", "scheduler", "optimizer"], "summary_hash": "f32c575d9be0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:39:17+00:00"}
