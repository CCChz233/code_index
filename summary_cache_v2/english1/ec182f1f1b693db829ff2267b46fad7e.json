{"summary": "The module provides a PyTorch implementation of a GraphSAGE-based graph neural network that trains on large-scale node property prediction tasks using DGL's clustering mini-batch approach. It defines the GraphSAGE aggregation layer, constructs the model, loads the OGB node property prediction dataset, performs clustered graph sampling for efficient training, and evaluates performance with standard metrics.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate how to build and train a scalable GraphSAGE model for node classification on massive graphs, enabling practitioners to apply graph neural networks to real-world large datasets with efficient mini-batch processing.", "keywords": ["GraphSAGE", "GNN", "DGL", "PyTorch", "node classification", "OGB", "clustered mini-batch training", "graph neural network", "large-scale graphs", "graph sampling"], "summary_hash": "faa9d56092e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:18:10+00:00"}
