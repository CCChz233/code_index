It includes a data manager that downloads, caches, and parses the remote CSV feed, and a sensor entity that exposes individual measurements such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind information together with station metadata and timestamps. The platform handles configuration, throttles updates, and integrates the data as Home Assistant entities.", "business_intent": "Allow Home Assistant users to monitor Austrian meteorological data within their smart home environment, enabling dashboards and automations based on real‑time weather conditions from ZAMG.", "keywords": ["Home Assistant", "sensor", "ZAMG", "weather", "Austria", "meteorology", "temperature", "humidity", "pressure", "wind speed", "wind direction", "CSV", "data fetching", "caching", "throttling", "entity attributes"], "summary_hash": "fd1990fce392", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:15:48+00:00"}
