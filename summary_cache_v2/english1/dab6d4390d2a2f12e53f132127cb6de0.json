{"summary": "The module defines a hierarchy of result types and utilities for managing the outcomes of Prefect tasks and flows. It includes lightweight containers for literal and in‑memory results, mechanisms to serialize and store complex objects in configurable storage blocks, and a factory that creates appropriate result instances while handling caching and metadata. Helper functions expose default persistence settings, serializers, and storage configurations.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable persistence, retrieval, and transmission of workflow results by abstracting serialization and storage concerns, allowing users to configure default behaviors and efficiently cache results within the Prefect orchestration platform.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "result handling", "serialization", "storage block", "persistence", "caching", "factory pattern", "literal values", "binary blob", "default settings", "task flow outcomes"], "summary_hash": "4d336c1dbc4e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:25:07+00:00"}
