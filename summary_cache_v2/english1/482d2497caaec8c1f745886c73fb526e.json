{"summary": "The module implements a command‑line utility that configures a NeMo trainer and loads a pretrained Megatron‑CLIP model for inference. It prepares image preprocessing pipelines, feeds input data through the model, and outputs the resulting embeddings or similarity scores, allowing users to run zero‑shot vision‑language tasks without training.", "business_intent": "Provide an easy‑to‑use inference script for large‑scale vision‑language foundation models, enabling downstream applications such as image‑text retrieval, classification, or similarity scoring in production or research environments.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "CLIP", "vision-language", "inference", "multimodal", "NeMo", "image preprocessing", "zero-shot", "embedding extraction", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "d96a508821be", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:36:56+00:00"}
