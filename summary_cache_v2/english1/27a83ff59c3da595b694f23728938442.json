{"summary": "Defines abstract and concrete data containers that model primitive drawing elements (rectangular boxes, lines, text) for quantum pulse visualizations. Each object supplies a unique data key for identification, enabling plotter‑agnostic rendering, efficient visibility management, and backend‑independent updates.", "business_intent": "Provide a modular, testable representation of pulse diagram components that decouples the visualization logic from specific plotting libraries, allowing easy addition of new plotters and reliable unit testing of the visualization layer.", "keywords": ["quantum pulse", "visualization", "drawing primitives", "plotter agnostic", "testing", "data key", "dynamic updates", "backend independent"], "summary_hash": "d2d097f8ec65", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:02:06+00:00"}
