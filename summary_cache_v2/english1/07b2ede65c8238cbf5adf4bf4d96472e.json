{"summary": "The module implements a performance benchmark for the DGL library's inbound subgraph extraction operation. It generates synthetic graphs, repeatedly invokes the subgraph extraction on selected destination nodes, and records execution times to assess scalability and efficiency.", "business_intent": "To measure and analyze the runtime characteristics of the inbound subgraph API across varying graph sizes, helping developers and researchers optimize graph‑processing pipelines.", "keywords": ["DGL", "benchmark", "inbound subgraph", "graph processing", "performance measurement", "synthetic graph", "timing", "torch", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "6f23d1ba4d36", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:03:09+00:00"}
