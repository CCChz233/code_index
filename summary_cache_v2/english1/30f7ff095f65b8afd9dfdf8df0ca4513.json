{"summary": "Provides a post‑layout optimization pass for the Qiskit transpiler that removes idle wires from a fully transpiled circuit, searches the backend coupling graph for a lower‑error subgraph using the VF2++ subgraph‑isomorphism algorithm, and updates the circuit's qubit mapping while recording the stop reason in the property set.", "business_intent": "Automatically improve quantum circuit execution fidelity by finding a more error‑resilient qubit placement on the target hardware after standard transpilation.", "keywords": ["quantum computing", "transpiler", "layout optimization", "subgraph isomorphism", "VF2 algorithm", "error reduction", "idle wire removal", "qubit mapping", "backend coupling graph", "property set"], "summary_hash": "3c0ab5d8d73b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:29:25+00:00"}
