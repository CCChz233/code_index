It handles noise schedule parameters sigma_min, sigma_max, s_noise, s_churn, s_min, s_max. Provides methods for adding noise, scaling model input, setting timesteps, stepping, correcting steps. So summary: a scheduler that manages stochastic diffusion steps for variance-expanding diffusion models, controlling noise magnitude and stochasticity via configurable parameters, providing utilities to add noise, scale inputs, and advance timesteps.\n\nBusiness intent: to enable high-quality image generation (or generative modeling) using diffusion models by providing a flexible noise schedule that improves detail preservation and sampling stability. So business intent: support diffusion-based generative AI pipelines, allowing developers to fine-tune stochasticity for better sample quality.\n\nKeywords: scheduler, diffusion, variance expanding, stochastic noise, sigma schedule, s_noise, s_churn, generative AI, model sampling, noise scaling.\n\nMake sure not to list method names verbatim.
