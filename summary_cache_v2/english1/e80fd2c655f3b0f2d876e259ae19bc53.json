{"summary": "The module provides a collection of highly configurable convolutional building blocks—generic convolutions, down‑sampling, up‑sampling, residual blocks, and group normalization—supporting 1‑D/2‑D/3‑D data, optional tensor splitting, mixed‑precision handling, and memory‑saving checkpointing. These components are assembled into a custom encoder and decoder that feed a KL‑regularized variational autoencoder (AutoencoderKL) used in the MAISI generation pipeline. The architecture offers optional attention mechanisms (standard, non‑local, flash, combined linear), ConvTranspose up‑sampling, flexible channel and block configurations, and mixed‑precision support, enabling memory‑efficient, flexible VAE models for medical image generation.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to build and experiment with memory‑optimized, flexible variational autoencoders for high‑dimensional medical imaging and related generation tasks, reducing GPU consumption while allowing extensive architectural customization.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "KL divergence", "encoder", "decoder", "attention", "non-local attention", "flash attention", "residual block", "group normalization", "convtranspose upsampling", "tensor splitting", "memory optimization", "mixed precision", "medical imaging", "3D convolution"], "summary_hash": "1c76613c81a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:32:28+00:00"}
