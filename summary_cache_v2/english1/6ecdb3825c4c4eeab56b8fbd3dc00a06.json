{"summary": "The function `find_optimal_lr` performs a learning rate range test to identify the optimal learning rate for training a model. It utilizes the `LearningRateFinder` callback from PyTorch Lightning to conduct the test. The function accepts a model, a training dataloader, and optional parameters such as the minimum and maximum learning rates, number of epochs, and a flag to indicate whether to use an exponential learning rate schedule. It returns the optimal learning rate found during the test.", "business_intent": "The function aims to automate the process of finding the optimal learning rate for training a model, reducing the need for manual experimentation and improving training efficiency.", "keywords": ["learning rate range test", "optimal learning rate", "PyTorch Lightning", "LearningRateFinder", "model training"], "summary_hash": "8738860f834b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:55:36+00:00"}
