{"summary": "Implements the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) convolution. For each node it adds a scaled self‑feature (1+ε) to an aggregated neighbor feature (sum, max, or mean, optionally weighted by edge scalars), then applies a user‑provided transformation and optional activation.", "business_intent": "Provide a powerful, learnable graph convolution layer that captures structural information for building graph neural networks used in tasks like node or graph classification and other graph‑based predictions.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "GIN", "message passing", "aggregation", "learnable epsilon", "edge weighting", "activation", "PyTorch", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "13ea7603d4bb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:55:33+00:00"}
