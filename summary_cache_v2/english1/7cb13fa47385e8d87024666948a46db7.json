{"summary": "Implements a diffusion model scheduler that uses the DPMSolver single‑step algorithm to compute denoising steps in a single inference pass. The module defines a configurable scheduler class, handling noise schedule generation, step computation, and integration with the broader diffusion pipeline.", "business_intent": "Accelerate generative AI inference by providing a fast, high‑quality sampling method for diffusion models, reducing the number of required diffusion steps and computational cost.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "DPMSolver", "single-step sampling", "noise schedule", "Karras", "torch", "generative AI", "inference acceleration"], "summary_hash": "770cb984fc77", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:14:24+00:00"}
