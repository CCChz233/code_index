{"summary": "The module offers high‑level utilities for loading UXarray datasets and grid structures from storage formats (e.g., NetCDF). It wraps xarray loading mechanisms, maps dimensions to UGRID conventions, and returns UXarray‑specific objects for downstream analysis.", "business_intent": "Provide a simple, consistent entry point for users and applications to ingest unstructured grid data into the UXarray ecosystem, enabling efficient data exploration, processing, and visualization.", "keywords": ["UXarray", "dataset loading", "grid loading", "xarray integration", "UGRID", "NetCDF", "multifile dataset", "data ingestion"], "summary_hash": "4ca11572a4b6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:28:54+00:00"}
