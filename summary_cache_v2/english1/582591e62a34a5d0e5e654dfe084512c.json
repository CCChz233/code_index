{"summary": "The module provides simple helper utilities for summing values and defines placeholder test cases intended to exercise Triton kernels that accept variable numbers of arguments. However, the kernel functions are never called, leaving the tests ineffective and serving as a stub for future development.", "business_intent": "To verify that Triton kernels handling variable argument lists produce correct aggregate results, supporting integration with PyTorch and xformers workflows.", "keywords": ["Triton", "variable arguments", "kernel testing", "sum", "weighted sum", "PyTorch", "xformers", "placeholder", "dead code"], "summary_hash": "bb84c6b809bf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:26:57+00:00"}
