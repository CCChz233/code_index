{"summary": "An end‑to‑end example that showcases how to build, train, and evaluate a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) for graph classification using DGL with the MXNet backend. It includes utilities for loading benchmark graph datasets, configuring experiments via command‑line arguments, defining the GIN architecture with MLP‑based node updates and optional graph pooling, and running the full training and testing pipeline.", "business_intent": "Provide a reference implementation for researchers and engineers to quickly prototype and benchmark GIN models on standard graph classification tasks using MXNet, facilitating reproducible experiments and serving as a template for custom GNN development.", "keywords": ["Graph Isomorphism Network", "GIN", "MXNet", "DGL", "graph classification", "benchmark datasets", "MUTAG", "COLLAB", "IMDBBINARY", "IMDBMULTI", "data loader", "MLP", "batch normalization", "ReLU", "graph pooling", "command line parser", "training loop", "evaluation"], "summary_hash": "c35a714fbb5f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:50:31+00:00"}
