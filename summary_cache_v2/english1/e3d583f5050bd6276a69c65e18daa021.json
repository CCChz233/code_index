{"summary": "The module defines a set of generator utilities that translate pulse frame‑change instructions into visual drawing primitives. Each generator receives a formatted PulseInstruction together with style and device configuration, and produces elementary drawing objects that depict frequency and phase adjustments in Qiskit pulse diagrams.", "business_intent": "Enable clear, customizable visualizations of quantum pulse frame changes (frequency and phase shifts) to aid users in analyzing and debugging pulse schedules within the Qiskit ecosystem.", "keywords": ["pulse visualization", "frame change", "frequency", "phase", "Qiskit", "drawing generators", "formatter", "device backend", "elementary data", "quantum control"], "summary_hash": "d8d1f2dbe057", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:03:41+00:00"}
