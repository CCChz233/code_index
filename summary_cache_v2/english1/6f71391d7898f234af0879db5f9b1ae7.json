{"summary": "This module supplies a collection of weight initialization routines and helper utilities for transformer components. It includes several predefined initialization schemes (e.g., small-scale, Vision Transformer variants, LeCun normal) and functions to conditionally apply these schemes to tensors, report missing initializations, and retrieve the appropriate initializer based on configuration. Additional helpers identify whether a layer belongs to a feed‑forward network or serves as an input projection for multi‑head attention.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible and standardized way to initialize model parameters in transformer architectures, improving training stability, convergence speed, and reproducibility across different model variants.", "keywords": ["weight initialization", "transformer", "feed‑forward network", "multi‑head attention", "LeCun normal", "Vision Transformer", "PyTorch", "utility functions", "model stability"], "summary_hash": "441a8dca5843", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:27:49+00:00"}
