The request: \"We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\" Could be for the module overall. Let's produce a summary that covers both modeling components and pipeline.\n\nThus summary: Implements UniDiffuser pipeline: transformer-based decoder for text, core transformer backbone for image-text diffusion, and high-level pipeline integrating CLIP encoders, VAE, UNet denoiser, scheduler to generate images, text, or aligned pairs.\n\nBusiness intent: Provide a multimodal diffusion system that can generate images conditioned on text and/or images, produce text from images, and support fine-tuning via LoRA/PEFT, enabling creative content generation.\n\nKeywords: UniDiffuser, diffusion, multimodal, transformer, CLIP, VAE, UNet, scheduler, text generation, image generation, cross-attention, latent space, LoRA, PEFT.\n\nLet's output JSON.\n\nNeed to ensure no function names verbatim. Avoid listing function names like _no_grad_trunc_normal_, norm_cdf, trunc_normal_, etc. That's fine.\n\nNow produce JSON with double braces?
