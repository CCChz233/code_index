{"summary": "This module defines a set of classes and functions for resizing images and related data structures in various ways, including scaling to a maximum size, random scaling, resizing to specific dimensions, and resizing based on the shortest side. It also includes schema definitions for initializing these transformations with validation and constraints.", "business_intent": "The primary purpose of this module is to provide flexible and configurable image resizing capabilities for data augmentation in computer vision tasks, ensuring that images and associated annotations are appropriately scaled while maintaining aspect ratio and adhering to specified constraints.", "keywords": ["image resizing", "data augmentation", "computer vision", "aspect ratio preservation", "scale constraints", "OpenCV interpolation", "mask handling", "bounding box scaling", "keypoint scaling"], "summary_hash": "4c31e2c5dc3e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:29:05+00:00"}
