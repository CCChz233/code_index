{"summary": "This module implements utilities for creating semi‑sorted batches of audio‑text data used in ASR training. It provides a sampler that groups sample indices by length to form batches on demand, calculates the required number of batches, and supports distributed sampling. A convenience function is also supplied to instantiate the sampler with a dataset and batch configuration.", "business_intent": "Enable more efficient training of automatic speech recognition models by reducing padding overhead and improving GPU utilization through length‑aware batching, especially in multi‑GPU or distributed environments.", "keywords": ["ASR", "batching", "semi-sorted sampler", "audio-to-text", "length-based batching", "distributed training", "PyTorch", "dataset", "padding reduction"], "summary_hash": "c922978a7762", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:11:51+00:00"}
