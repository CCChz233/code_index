{"summary": "This module contains a collection of unit tests that validate the behavior of AWS Security Token Service (STS) operations using the Moto library to mock AWS services. The tests cover scenarios such as assuming roles (including with SAML and web identity), obtaining federation and session tokens, retrieving caller identity, and handling region-specific configurations, while also checking edge cases like policy length limits and XML namespace handling.", "business_intent": "Ensure that applications interacting with AWS STS correctly handle credential acquisition, role assumption, and token generation across various authentication methods, and that the underlying SDK functions behave as expected under mocked conditions.", "keywords": ["AWS STS", "assume role", "SAML", "web identity", "federation token", "session token", "caller identity", "boto3", "moto", "unit testing", "mock AWS", "policy length", "XML namespaces", "credential handling"], "summary_hash": "ba6ca9627f93", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:33:44+00:00"}
