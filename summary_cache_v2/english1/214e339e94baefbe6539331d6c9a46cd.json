{"summary": "This module implements an integration test that prepares a deterministic environment, loads the MedNIST medical imaging dataset via a custom dataset wrapper, trains a 2‑D DenseNet121 classifier, performs inference on a sample, and validates both the correctness of the training outcome and the execution timing. The test suite ensures the end‑to‑end workflow functions as expected.", "business_intent": "To confirm that the complete training and inference pipeline for 2‑D medical image classification operates reliably and meets performance criteria, providing regression protection for the MONAI framework.", "keywords": ["integration test", "2D classification", "medical imaging", "MONAI", "DenseNet121", "MedNIST", "training validation", "inference verification", "performance timing", "deterministic reproducibility", "dataset wrapper"], "summary_hash": "171ad10f3272", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:29:11+00:00"}
