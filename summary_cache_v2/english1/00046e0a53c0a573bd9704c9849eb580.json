{"summary": "Provides mixin classes and helper utilities that add adapter‑layer support to NeMo model components. It introduces a registry for adapter modules, manages their configuration, activation state, zero‑initialization, and serialization, allowing models to dynamically incorporate and control adapters for fine‑tuning or domain adaptation.", "business_intent": "Facilitate modular and reusable adapter integration in speech and language models, enabling efficient transfer learning and customization without altering the core model architecture.", "keywords": ["adapter", "mixin", "registry", "configuration", "activation", "zero‑initialization", "transfer learning", "fine‑tuning", "NeMo", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "87d4c71ceb92", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:42:37+00:00"}
