{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class TestDiceFocalLoss. It's a test class for DiceFocalLoss (likely a loss function).

So the class tests various aspects: invalid lambda values, shape mismatches, result behavior with/without one-hot encoding and background inclusion, script execution, alpha parameter.\n\nThus summary: The class provides unit tests to verify correctness and robustness of DiceFocalLoss implementation, checking parameter validation, input shape handling, loss computation under different encoding and background settings, script functionality, and alpha weighting.\n\nBusiness intent: Ensure reliability of loss function for segmentation models, catch errors early, maintain quality.\n\nKeywords: unit testing, loss function, DiceFocalLoss, parameter validation, shape validation, one-hot encoding, background class, alpha weighting, segmentation, robustness.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed to start with {{ and end with }}?
