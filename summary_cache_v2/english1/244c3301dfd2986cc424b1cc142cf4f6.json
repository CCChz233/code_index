{"summary": "The class integrates a LayoutLMv3 image processor and a tokenizer to provide a unified preprocessing pipeline for document images. It handles image resizing, normalization, optional OCR extraction of words and bounding boxes, and converts these into token-level inputs (ids, masks, token types, and bounding boxes) suitable for the LayoutLMv3 model, with optional label mapping for token classification.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to efficiently prepare document image data for LayoutLMv3, streamlining the workflow for tasks such as form understanding, receipt parsing, and other token classification applications in document AI.", "keywords": ["layoutlmv3", "image preprocessing", "ocr", "tokenization", "bounding boxes", "token classification", "document AI", "data preparation", "model input"], "summary_hash": "e29dc48a7d83", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:45:29+00:00"}
