{"summary": "This module implements a pluggable checkpoint I/O framework for Lightning Fabric, providing an abstract persistence interface and concrete plugins for PyTorch and XLA/TPU environments. It manages saving, loading, and cleanup of model state with filesystem abstraction and atomic write handling.", "business_intent": "Allow training workflows to persist and restore model checkpoints in a flexible, device‑agnostic manner, supporting interchangeable storage backends and runtime‑specific requirements.", "keywords": ["checkpoint", "I/O plugin", "Lightning Fabric", "PyTorch", "XLA", "TPU", "abstract interface", "save", "load", "cleanup", "filesystem abstraction", "atomic write", "extensibility"], "summary_hash": "c68d88be1f7b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:15:20+00:00"}
