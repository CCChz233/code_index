The instruction: \"output ONLY a JSON object with keys: `summary`, `business_intent`, `keywords`\". It doesn't specify multiple objects.

But here they ask \"output ONLY a JSON object with keys: summary, business_intent, keywords\". So maybe they expect one JSON for the current file being analyzed (the last file).

Likely they want a combined summary of the module that includes both strategies? But they are separate files.
