{"summary": "Offers a property that yields an object for pure, functional array element updates, emulating in-place assignment while returning a modified copy. Supports arithmetic, reduction, custom function application, and element retrieval, with configurable out-of-bounds handling and optional assumptions about index ordering and uniqueness to improve execution efficiency.", "business_intent": "Enable immutable array manipulation in JAX, allowing JIT‑compiled code to perform efficient in-place‑like updates without side effects and with flexible out-of-bounds semantics.", "keywords": ["array indexing", "functional update", "JAX", "immutable array", "jit optimization", "scatter", "gather", "out-of-bounds handling", "performance"], "summary_hash": "26f3bdc62455", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:36:23+00:00"}
