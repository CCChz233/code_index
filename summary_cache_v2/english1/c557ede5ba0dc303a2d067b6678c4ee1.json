{"summary": "This module manages infinite shape metadata for Megatron models, providing utilities to extract, store, serialize, and apply shape information to layers for width scaling (MUP). It includes helpers for handling data‑parallel quirks, zipping shape dictionaries, and rescaling linear biases.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable model width adjustments by tracking and applying shape metadata, allowing consistent layer resizing across distributed training and inference pipelines.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "MUP", "infinite shape", "model scaling", "layer rescaling", "shape metadata", "serialization", "yaml", "data parallel", "neural network"], "summary_hash": "a9c9bb9f9fe2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:25:49+00:00"}
