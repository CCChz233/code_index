{"summary": "The custom_diffusion example package supplies command‑line tools and tests for adapting Stable Diffusion to new subjects with only a handful of images. It includes a utility that fetches regularization images via CLIP‑based retrieval, a training script that builds datasets, parses options, configures the model, optimizer and optional attention‑processor modifications, runs the diffusion fine‑tuning loop, and stores the tuned weights and metadata, and a test suite that validates checkpoint rotation logic during accelerated training.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to quickly create personalized text‑to‑image generators by fine‑tuning diffusion models on custom concepts, reducing data requirements and simplifying deployment for niche applications or commercial products.", "keywords": ["custom diffusion", "stable diffusion", "few‑shot fine‑tuning", "image retrieval", "CLIP", "training script", "checkpoint management", "textual inversion", "accelerate", "diffusers", "personalized generation"], "summary_hash": "cd94493e76b9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:37:00+00:00"}
