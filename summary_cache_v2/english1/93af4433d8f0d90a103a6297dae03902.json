{"summary": "A unit‑test module that verifies the masked loss component in the MONAI library. It checks that the loss can be instantiated with different mask options, raises appropriate errors for invalid configurations, runs correctly when scripted, and produces outputs with the expected dimensions.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of the masked loss functionality used in medical imaging deep‑learning pipelines, ensuring reliable model training and deployment.", "keywords": ["masked loss", "unit testing", "MONAI", "DiceLoss", "DiceFocalLoss", "scriptability", "error handling", "output shape", "determinism", "parameterized tests", "torch", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "59ee4340459e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:42:40+00:00"}
