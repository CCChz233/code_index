{"summary": "A transformer‑based decoder that converts image‑text joint embeddings into natural language sequences. It accepts configurable prefix embeddings from a CLIP text encoder, processes them through a GPT‑2‑style architecture with adjustable layers, heads, and dropout, and outputs token probabilities for text generation.", "business_intent": "Provides the core capability for generating captions, descriptions, or any textual output from multimodal representations, enabling image‑captioning services, multimodal content creation, and downstream AI applications that require converting visual‑semantic embeddings into readable language.", "keywords": ["text decoding", "multimodal embedding", "transformer", "GPT-2", "beam search", "caption generation", "UniDiffuser", "image‑text model", "prefix encoding", "language generation"], "summary_hash": "d6f889592b93", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:12:00+00:00"}
