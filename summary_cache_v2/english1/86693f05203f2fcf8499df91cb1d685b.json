{"summary": "This module implements an end‑to‑end diffusion pipeline that takes an input image and a natural‑language instruction, encodes the image into latent space, processes the instruction with dual CLIP text encoders, runs a conditional denoising diffusion step using a UNet and scheduler, and finally decodes the latents back into an edited image. It includes optional features such as aesthetic conditioning, zero‑negative prompting, invisible watermarking, and support for loading LoRA or textual‑inversion weights.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to perform instruction‑driven image editing and generation, facilitating rapid visual prototyping, personalized media creation, and automated graphic design workflows.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion xl", "instruction-based image editing", "pix2pix", "diffusion pipeline", "image-to-image generation", "CLIP text encoder", "UNet denoiser", "scheduler", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "aesthetic conditioning", "zero-negative prompts", "invisible watermark"], "summary_hash": "fcc9f6e8e58e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:23:46+00:00"}
