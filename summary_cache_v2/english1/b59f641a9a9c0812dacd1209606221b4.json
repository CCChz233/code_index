{"summary": "Represents a memory reference with a potentially multi‑slot layout when the leading dimension is small. The reference defines a region that begins at a (possibly dynamic) base address and spans a fixed static length. It provides utilities to query which entities read from or write to a given offset within the region.", "business_intent": "Enables analysis and optimization tools (e.g., compilers, static analyzers) to model and reason about memory accesses, aliasing, and data layout for performance and correctness improvements.", "keywords": ["memory reference", "base address", "static length", "dynamic base", "multi‑slot layout", "leading dimension", "access queries", "read/write analysis", "alias analysis", "data modeling"], "summary_hash": "9bb2d3f89461", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:44:17+00:00"}
