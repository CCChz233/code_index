{"summary": "This module provides a suite of unit tests that validate the core behavior of the SpadeNet neural network, checking that its encoder‑decoder pipeline operates correctly, that forward passes succeed for both 2‑D and 3‑D inputs, and that inappropriate input dimensions raise proper errors.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the robustness and correctness of the SpadeNet model used in medical imaging pipelines, enabling early detection of shape‑related bugs and ensuring reliable performance across different data dimensionalities.", "keywords": ["SpadeNet", "unit testing", "encoder-decoder", "forward pass", "2D input", "3D input", "input shape validation", "MONAI", "PyTorch", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "923ea6d2875b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:32:54+00:00"}
