{"summary": "Defines core classes that enable reversible and traceable data transformations in MONAI. The base invertible transform records applied operations in a stack and stores per‑key auxiliary information so that transformations can be undone in a last‑in‑first‑out manner. The traceable variant adds mechanisms to log and monitor transformation steps, supporting lazy attributes and metadata handling.", "business_intent": "Provide a robust framework for building data preprocessing pipelines that can be reversed or inspected, improving reproducibility, debugging, and analysis of medical imaging workflows.", "keywords": ["invertible", "reversible", "transform", "stack", "metadata", "traceable", "MONAI", "data augmentation", "undo", "debugging", "pipeline"], "summary_hash": "8b182d5a11bf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:04:50+00:00"}
