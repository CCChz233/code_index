{"summary": "The module defines a benchmark suite for measuring the performance of sparse‑dense‑dense matrix multiplication (SDDMM) kernels used in attention mechanisms. It generates random sparse patterns, constructs test tensors of various sizes and sparsities, and times the execution of the SDDMM implementations provided by the xformers library.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with quantitative performance data for different SDDMM implementations, enabling them to assess and optimize sparse attention operations in transformer models.", "keywords": ["benchmark", "SDDMM", "sparse matrix", "dense matrix", "attention", "performance", "torch", "xformers", "sparsity", "CSR", "COO"], "summary_hash": "4032e28c1f04", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:28:20+00:00"}
