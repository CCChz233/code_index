{"summary": "The example showcases DimeNet and DimeNet++ graph neural network models implemented with DGL and PyTorch for predicting quantum‑chemical properties of molecules from the QM9 dataset. It includes a dataset loader that converts molecular structures into DGL graphs, a training script that builds, trains, and evaluates the models, and a conversion utility to migrate pretrained TensorFlow checkpoints to the PyTorch implementation.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to quickly experiment with state‑of‑the‑art directional message‑passing GNNs on molecular property prediction, and to leverage existing TensorFlow pretrained weights within a PyTorch workflow.", "keywords": ["DimeNet", "DimeNet++", "graph neural network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "QM9", "molecular property prediction", "quantum chemistry", "TensorFlow to PyTorch conversion", "directional message passing", "graph dataset"], "summary_hash": "e17923e18ddb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:52:36+00:00"}
