{"summary": "The module implements a TextClassificationModel that encapsulates the full lifecycle of a text classification system within the NeMo framework. It builds data loaders from configuration, defines a sequence classifier, sets up cross‑entropy loss (with optional class weighting), computes metrics such as classification reports, and orchestrates training, validation, testing, and inference steps using PyTorch Lightning. The model can be exported for deployment on new text inputs.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and enterprises to quickly develop, train, evaluate, and deploy customizable NLP text classification models (e.g., sentiment analysis, intent detection) for production use.", "keywords": ["text classification", "NLP", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "sequence classifier", "cross entropy loss", "class weighting", "classification report", "training loop", "validation", "testing", "inference", "exportable model", "configurable data loader"], "summary_hash": "889cf54196a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:34:15+00:00"}
