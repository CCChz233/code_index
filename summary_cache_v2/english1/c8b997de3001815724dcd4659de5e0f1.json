{"summary": "Provides an on‑line, lazy mapping of dataset sample indices that can dynamically upsample or downsample a collection while applying a two‑level pseudo‑random shuffle (block order and intra‑block order). The object behaves like a sequence, exposing length and element access without pre‑computing the full mapping.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable data loading pipelines to adjust sample rates and introduce stochastic ordering without the memory and time cost of pre‑computing a full index list.", "keywords": ["online mapping", "sample index", "upsampling", "downsampling", "pseudo‑random shuffle", "block shuffling", "lazy evaluation", "data loader", "sequence interface"], "summary_hash": "3e32341248a3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:57:01+00:00"}
