{"summary": "A comprehensive test suite that validates the plasma physics library's thermal speed calculations, including standard, coefficient-based, lightweight, and kappa-distribution methods. The tests check numerical accuracy, proper handling of invalid inputs and edge cases, emission of appropriate warnings, and integration with just-in-time compilation mechanisms.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the scientific correctness and robustness of thermal speed computation tools used in plasma research, thereby supporting reliable simulations, data analysis, and software quality assurance for users of the library.", "keywords": ["thermal speed", "kappa distribution", "plasma physics", "unit testing", "validation", "numerical accuracy", "error handling", "warning management", "just-in-time compilation", "lightweight implementation", "coefficient calculation"], "summary_hash": "03667fda7a7d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:08:17+00:00"}
