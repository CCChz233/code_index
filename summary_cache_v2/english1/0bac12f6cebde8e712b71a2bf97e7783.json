{"summary": "A sequential container that applies a series of augmentation modules to 5‑dimensional video tensors (batch, time, channels, height, width or batch, channels, time, height, width). It can enforce identical transformations across all frames, randomly choose a subset of augmentations, and propagate inverse operations and metadata transformations (boxes, masks, keypoints).", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, temporally consistent augmentation pipeline for video data, simplifying preprocessing and data augmentation for video deep‑learning models while supporting stochastic selection and reversible transformations.", "keywords": ["video augmentation", "sequential pipeline", "temporal consistency", "same_on_frame", "random_apply", "data format conversion", "inverse transformation", "metadata handling", "kornia", "BCTHW", "BTCHW"], "summary_hash": "685137a21591", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:52:46+00:00"}
