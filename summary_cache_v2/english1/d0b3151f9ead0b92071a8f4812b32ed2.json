{"summary": "This test module validates the core behavior of LightningModule within the PyTorch Lightning framework. It includes a variety of unit tests that check device placement, Fabric attributes and logging, optimizer toggling (including multiple optimizers with shared or distinct parameters), gradient clipping configuration, property accessors (epoch, global step, ranks, logger), reference handling for Trainer and Fabric, scriptability, reference counting, and state dict handling for sharded tensors.", "business_intent": "Ensure that LightningModule integrates correctly with Fabric and Trainer, manages optimizers and gradient clipping reliably, provides accurate runtime properties, supports logging and serialization, and maintains proper resource handling, thereby guaranteeing robustness for downstream deep learning applications.", "keywords": ["LightningModule", "PyTorch Lightning", "Fabric", "Trainer", "optimizer toggling", "gradient clipping", "device placement", "logging", "property accessors", "scriptability", "reference counting", "sharded tensor state dict", "unit tests"], "summary_hash": "ebf6ad2c3331", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:38:34+00:00"}
