{"summary": "The module provides a suite of transpiler passes and utilities that detect groups of mutually commuting two‑qubit operations, encapsulate them as composite blocks, analyze Pauli evolution gates for commuting relationships, and route these blocks onto a device’s coupling map using configurable swap‑layer strategies while preserving the current qubit layout.", "business_intent": "To reduce the overhead of routing commuting two‑qubit gates on hardware with limited connectivity, thereby decreasing circuit depth, swap count, and error rates during quantum circuit compilation for more efficient execution on quantum processors.", "keywords": ["quantum transpilation", "commuting two-qubit gates", "swap strategy", "coupling map", "layout management", "Pauli evolution", "circuit routing", "composite gate block", "hardware connectivity"], "summary_hash": "ca6b254921b6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:09:11+00:00"}
