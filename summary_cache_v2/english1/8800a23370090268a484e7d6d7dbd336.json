{"summary": "The module provides utilities to transform Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model checkpoints into the format expected by the Hugging Face Diffusers library. It includes functions for mapping weights, converting convolutional attention layers to linear equivalents, rebuilding UNet and VAE configurations, and renaming or pruning model paths to match Diffusers' architecture.", "business_intent": "Enable users to migrate existing SVD pretrained checkpoints to the Diffusers ecosystem, allowing seamless integration, inference, and fine‑tuning with Hugging Face tools.", "keywords": ["checkpoint conversion", "Stable Video Diffusion", "Diffusers", "UNet", "VAE", "weight mapping", "attention conversion", "resnet path renaming", "model migration"], "summary_hash": "4ea9c15a5513", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:42:07+00:00"}
