{"summary": "The module provides a collection of helper functions for visualising spatial data using Matplotlib. It includes utilities for colour‑scaling, converting coordinate reference system objects to readable strings, reading legend files, and rendering raster or vector data as images or maps (including top‑view plots). The functions handle optional dependencies and aim to simplify the creation of clear, georeferenced visualisations.", "business_intent": "Enable analysts and developers to quickly generate informative visual representations of geospatial datasets, supporting proper colour mapping, CRS annotation, and legend handling for reporting and decision‑making.", "keywords": ["visualization", "spatial data", "map plotting", "imshow", "top view", "colour scale", "CRS conversion", "legend reading", "matplotlib", "geospatial"], "summary_hash": "14d7e6b53477", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:44:37+00:00"}
