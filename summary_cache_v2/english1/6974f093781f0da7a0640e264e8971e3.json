{"summary": "The module implements the core data model for Qiskit's pulse visualizer. It defines a canvas that holds multiple chart objects, each aggregating drawings from several pulse channels and handling coordinate binding, axis breaks, and truncation. The canvas manages global settings such as device information, stylesheet, time range, and visibility, and propagates them to the charts, enabling consistent updates and flexible placement of visual elements on the plot.", "business_intent": "Provide a backend‑agnostic framework that lets users load quantum pulse schedules, configure display parameters, and generate accurate, customizable visual representations of pulse programs for analysis and debugging across different quantum devices.", "keywords": ["pulse visualization", "canvas", "chart", "Qiskit", "quantum backend", "stylesheet", "axis break", "time range", "drawing collection", "schedule rendering"], "summary_hash": "b9b27792df84", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:02:38+00:00"}
