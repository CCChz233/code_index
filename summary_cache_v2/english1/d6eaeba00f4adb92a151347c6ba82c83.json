{"summary": "This module defines the configuration model for the TensorFlow object detection backend in Raster Vision. It encapsulates script locations, training hyper‑parameters, model and data source specifications, and provides utilities to serialize the configuration to protobuf, persist model bundles, and instantiate the backend for training and evaluation.", "business_intent": "Allow users of the Raster Vision platform to declaratively configure, serialize, and execute TensorFlow object detection training pipelines, ensuring reproducible model creation and easy integration with downstream geospatial analysis workflows.", "keywords": ["TensorFlow", "object detection", "configuration", "backend", "training pipeline", "protobuf", "script management", "model bundle", "hyperparameters", "builder pattern", "Raster Vision"], "summary_hash": "f2a5d45b8ab0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:57:04+00:00"}
