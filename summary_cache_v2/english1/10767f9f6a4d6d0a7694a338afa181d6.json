{"summary": "Implements a configurable transformer layer that combines multi‑head attention (self, cross, or double self) with a feed‑forward network, layer or adaptive normalization, dropout, and optional positional embeddings, allowing fine‑grained control over attention type, precision, and gating for use in diffusion and other generative models.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable building block for constructing advanced neural architectures, especially diffusion‑based image or text generation pipelines, by offering flexible attention and normalization options that can be tailored to various training regimes and hardware constraints.", "keywords": ["transformer", "multi-head attention", "self-attention", "cross-attention", "feed-forward", "normalization", "dropout", "positional embeddings", "diffusion models", "configurable"], "summary_hash": "f0a219691175", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:08:16+00:00"}
