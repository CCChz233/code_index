{"summary": "LCMScheduler orchestrates the denoising diffusion process for latent diffusion models, extending standard DDPM schedulers with non‑Markovian guidance. It manages the diffusion timeline, computes noise schedules, scales model inputs, applies clipping and dynamic thresholding for numerical stability, and updates sample estimates at each step based on configurable prediction types.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, stable, and customizable inference for generative AI pipelines that rely on latent diffusion, allowing developers to fine‑tune noise schedules, stability mechanisms, and guidance strategies to produce high‑quality images or videos.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "latent diffusion", "non‑Markovian guidance", "beta schedule", "noise addition", "clipping", "dynamic thresholding", "timestep scaling", "inference"], "summary_hash": "0e8df9838cc7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:27:35+00:00"}
