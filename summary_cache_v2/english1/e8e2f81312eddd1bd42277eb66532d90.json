{"summary": "The module implements a comprehensive framework for active operating‑system fingerprinting. It defines data structures for Nmap fingerprint entries, parses fingerprint databases, orchestrates a series of TCP, UDP and ICMP probes, captures and processes the responses, and matches the observed behavior against known OS signatures to identify the target host's operating system.", "business_intent": "Enable security professionals and penetration testers to automatically discover the operating system of remote hosts through network probing, supporting vulnerability assessment, asset inventory and broader network reconnaissance activities.", "keywords": ["OS fingerprinting", "network scanning", "Nmap", "TCP probe", "ICMP probe", "UDP probe", "packet capture", "fingerprint matching", "security assessment", "penetration testing", "network reconnaissance"], "summary_hash": "e02cb144c5da", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:15:35+00:00"}
