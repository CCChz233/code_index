{"summary": "This module supplies shared utilities for Certbot DNS authenticator plugins that rely on the Lexicon library. It defines a client wrapper that abstracts communication with DNS providers, handling domain identifier lookup, creation and removal of TXT records, and translating HTTP and generic errors. It also implements a generic DNS authenticator that manages configuration, credentials, domain resolution, TTL settings, and record lifecycle using Lexicon, plus an internal proxy to emit deprecation warnings for legacy attributes. An auxiliary helper builds Lexicon configuration objects, though it is currently unused.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable foundation that lets Certbot automatically create and delete DNS records across many providers via Lexicon, enabling automated DNS‑01 challenge validation for SSL/TLS certificate issuance.", "keywords": ["certbot", "dns", "lexicon", "authenticator", "dns-01", "txt record", "domain management", "error handling", "configuration", "ttl", "deprecation proxy", "provider abstraction"], "summary_hash": "a2cedd36ebc0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:08:43+00:00"}
