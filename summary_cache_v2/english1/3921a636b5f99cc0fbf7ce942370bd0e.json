{"summary": "The module defines a suite of unit tests for DGL's distributed graph sampling APIs. It creates random bipartite and heterogeneous graphs, partitions them across multiple processes, starts server and client processes, and validates sampling operations such as neighbor sampling, edge‑type sampling, edge retrieval, degree queries, and subgraph extraction under various conditions (including shuffling and empty results).", "business_intent": "Verify that distributed sampling functions work correctly and consistently across different graph structures and configurations, providing confidence in DGL's scalability and correctness for large‑scale graph analytics.", "keywords": ["distributed sampling", "DGL", "graph partitioning", "RPC", "neighbor sampling", "edge type sampling", "heterogeneous graph", "bipartite graph", "unit testing", "multiprocessing"], "summary_hash": "94fc85e1808b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:07:04+00:00"}
