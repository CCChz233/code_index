{"summary": "Provides a trainer class that manages the end‑to‑end fine‑tuning of pretrained transformer language models using Conditional Preference Optimization. It handles data preprocessing, input concatenation, computation of the CPO loss together with standard cross‑entropy loss, training and evaluation loops, model generation, metric logging, and optional integration with PEFT adapters, custom optimizers, and callbacks.", "business_intent": "To give developers and researchers a ready‑to‑use tool for aligning large language models with human preferences by applying Conditional Preference Optimization during fine‑tuning, thereby simplifying the creation of preference‑aware, higher‑quality conversational AI systems.", "keywords": ["fine-tuning", "conditional preference optimization", "CPO loss", "transformer", "language model", "trainer", "preference data", "alignment", "PEFT adapters", "evaluation", "generation", "cross-entropy"], "summary_hash": "8dd23e39d625", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:59:13+00:00"}
