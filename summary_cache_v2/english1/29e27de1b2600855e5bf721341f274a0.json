{"summary": "The module implements a suite of Flax neural network components for transformer-style attention, including configurable multi‑head attention, feed‑forward blocks with gated linear units, and a 2‑dimensional spatial transformer. It also provides utilities for chunked and memory‑efficient attention computation, enabling flexible and low‑memory processing of image‑like tensors in diffusion models.", "business_intent": "To supply high‑performance, memory‑optimized transformer primitives for JAX/Flax‑based diffusion pipelines, allowing developers to integrate advanced attention mechanisms and spatial transformers into generative AI applications such as image synthesis and editing.", "keywords": ["Flax", "JAX", "multi-head attention", "transformer", "memory-efficient attention", "spatial transformer", "diffusion models", "gated linear unit", "chunked computation", "dropout"], "summary_hash": "f2b5ed8fb7b3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:15:01+00:00"}
