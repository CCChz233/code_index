{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that takes low‑resolution latent representations and generates higher‑resolution images by running a Stable Diffusion model in an upscaling mode. It orchestrates loading of the VAE, UNet, text encoder, tokenizer, and scheduler, processes inputs, performs diffusion steps on the latent space, and decodes the result back to an image.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use tool for enhancing image resolution or performing super‑resolution using Stable Diffusion, allowing developers and artists to generate higher‑quality images from coarse inputs.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "latent upscaling", "super‑resolution", "image generation", "diffusion pipeline", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "CLIP tokenizer", "text encoder"], "summary_hash": "72ab91254d99", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:25:05+00:00"}
