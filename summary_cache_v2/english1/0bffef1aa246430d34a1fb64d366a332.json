{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests that exercise various Cellpose‑based segmentation workflows within the Fractal framework. The tests cover scenarios such as bounding‑box segmentation, handling of overlapping objects, secondary labeling, multi‑channel inputs, and per‑field‑of‑view or per‑well labeling, using OME‑Zarr data structures and ROI tables.", "business_intent": "Validate and ensure the robustness of automated image segmentation pipelines for biomedical research, guaranteeing that Cellpose integration works correctly across diverse data configurations and labeling strategies in the Fractal platform.", "keywords": ["Cellpose", "segmentation", "workflow testing", "Fractal", "biomedical imaging", "OME-Zarr", "ROI", "labeling", "bounding box", "multi‑channel", "field of view"], "summary_hash": "72c26e34e90d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:58:25+00:00"}
