{"summary": "This module implements a Flax‑compatible scheduler for Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). It defines a state container for scheduler configuration and runtime variables, and provides the core logic to generate diffusion timesteps, compute beta schedules, handle variance clipping, scale samples, optionally clip model predictions, add noise, compute velocities, and step through the diffusion process in JAX/Flax.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient training and inference of diffusion‑based generative models on JAX/Flax platforms by supplying a fully featured DDPM scheduling component that manages the denoising schedule, noise injection, and variance handling required for high‑quality image synthesis.", "keywords": ["DDPM", "diffusion scheduler", "Flax", "JAX", "beta schedule", "variance clipping", "noise injection", "denoising", "generative modeling", "state management"], "summary_hash": "699d26a08158", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:13:22+00:00"}
