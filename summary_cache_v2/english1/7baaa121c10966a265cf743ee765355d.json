{"summary": "The module implements a suite of encoder and embedding components used in multimodal stable‑diffusion pipelines. It defines abstract base classes for embedding models and encoders, concrete tokenizers and embedder wrappers for BERT, CLIP, OpenCLIP, and class embeddings, utilities for timestep and spatial rescaling, a LoRA adapter wrapper, and a general conditioner that assembles conditioning tensors for diffusion models.", "business_intent": "Supply flexible, reusable building blocks that convert raw inputs (text, class labels, timesteps, images) into dense vector representations required by diffusion models, while supporting frozen pretrained transformers and low‑rank adaptation for efficient fine‑tuning.", "keywords": ["encoder", "embedding", "stable diffusion", "multimodal", "BERT", "CLIP", "OpenCLIP", "LoRA", "transformer", "timestep embedding", "spatial rescaler", "conditioning", "pretrained", "frozen model"], "summary_hash": "f604417bbb6d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:03:38+00:00"}
