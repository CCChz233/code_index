{"summary": "The package provides a collection of Qiskit transpiler passes that translate high‑level quantum operations into hardware‑compatible gate sequences. It defines a plugin system for registering custom synthesis algorithms, implements high‑level synthesis for abstract objects such as Clifford operators, linear functions, and permutations, and includes concrete passes for linear reversible function synthesis, exact unitary decomposition using KAK/Euler methods, Solovay‑Kitaev approximation of single‑qubit unitaries, and an AQC‑based synthesis approach.", "business_intent": "Automate the conversion of abstract quantum specifications into executable circuits that respect a target device's connectivity and native gate set, while offering extensibility through a plugin framework to incorporate new synthesis techniques and improve compilation efficiency.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit synthesis", "transpiler passes", "plugin architecture", "unitary decomposition", "high-level synthesis", "Solovay-Kitaev", "AQC algorithm", "linear reversible functions", "Clifford synthesis", "gate set optimization"], "summary_hash": "349532b9bc55", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:08:26+00:00"}
