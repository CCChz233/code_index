{"summary": "Defines ControlNet extensions for the Stable Diffusion 3 transformer, offering a specialized control net model that configures attention processors, supports gradient checkpointing, fused QKV projections, and chunked forward passes, as well as a wrapper that combines multiple such control nets to deliver aggregated conditioning signals to the UNet during diffusion denoising.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to incorporate fine‑grained, external conditioning (e.g., depth maps, poses) into Stable Diffusion 3 pipelines, allowing controllable image synthesis and the flexible composition of several control signals within a single diffusion workflow.", "keywords": ["ControlNet", "Stable Diffusion 3", "Transformer", "Attention processor", "Gradient checkpointing", "Fused QKV", "Multi‑control", "Conditioning signals", "Diffusion denoising", "Image generation"], "summary_hash": "425ba6ca316b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:31:17+00:00"}
