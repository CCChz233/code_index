{"summary": "This module implements a diffusion pipeline that generates images from textual prompts by leveraging the PixArt‑Sigma model enhanced with Progressive Distillation (PAG). It orchestrates prompt tokenization, image processor setup, latent space initialization, and iterative denoising steps using configurable schedulers to produce high‑fidelity outputs.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to produce high‑quality AI‑generated images from text, supporting applications such as digital art, marketing material, product visualization, and rapid prototyping.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "diffusion pipeline", "PixArt Sigma", "Progressive Distillation", "PAG", "latent generation", "scheduler", "transformer model", "autoencoder", "image processor", "T5 tokenizer"], "summary_hash": "b32d8d31d194", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:17:05+00:00"}
