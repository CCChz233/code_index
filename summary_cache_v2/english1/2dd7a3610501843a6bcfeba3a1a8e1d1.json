{"summary": "A collection of utility functions for voice activity detection (VAD) within the NeMo ASR framework. The module handles model initialization, frame‑level VAD inference, conversion of predictions to speech/non‑speech segments, filtering short segments, loading and writing RTTM files, constructing pyannote annotation objects, preparing manifests for training/evaluation, computing detection metrics, and visualising VAD results.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to build, tune, and evaluate VAD components in speech recognition pipelines, facilitating accurate speech segmentation, dataset preparation, and performance analysis for downstream ASR applications.", "keywords": ["voice activity detection", "VAD", "speech segmentation", "RTTM", "pyannote", "manifest preparation", "ASR", "model inference", "evaluation metrics", "threshold tuning", "segment filtering", "overlap handling", "visualisation"], "summary_hash": "59adc98c9cbe", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:12:08+00:00"}
