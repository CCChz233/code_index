{"summary": "The module defines PyTorch neural‑network layers that automatically build graph structures from collections of point coordinates. It offers three graph‑generation strategies: (1) connecting each point to its k‑nearest neighbors (including self‑loops) with batch‑aware indexing, (2) linking points that lie within a specified radius using a configurable Minkowski metric and optional self‑loops, and (3) assembling graphs from multiple point sets by concatenating them and applying k‑nearest neighbor connections with appropriate node ID offsets. A lightweight helper computes pairwise squared distances to support these constructions.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the preprocessing of geometric or point‑cloud data into graph formats required by graph neural network models, providing efficient, batched, and configurable neighbor‑search utilities within the DGL‑PyTorch ecosystem.", "keywords": ["graph construction", "k-nearest neighbors", "radius graph", "segmented knn", "point cloud", "PyTorch", "DGL", "batch processing", "pairwise distance", "graph neural networks"], "summary_hash": "350c6310ee47", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:42:45+00:00"}
