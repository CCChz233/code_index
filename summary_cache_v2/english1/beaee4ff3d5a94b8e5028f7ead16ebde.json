{"summary": "The module provides a comprehensive test suite for the self‑attention block used in MONAI networks. It verifies correct behavior of the attention matrix, supports causal and flash attention modes, checks handling of different input dimensions, validates parameter counts, tests relative position embeddings, ensures attention outputs can be saved, confirms scriptability with TorchScript, and asserts expected output shapes.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability and correctness of the self‑attention implementation in MONAI, supporting robust medical imaging deep‑learning models and facilitating maintenance and future development.", "keywords": ["self‑attention", "unit testing", "MONAI", "SABlock", "causal attention", "flash attention", "relative position embedding", "scriptability", "parameter count", "output shape", "PyTorch", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "2708eefa0b54", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:01:45+00:00"}
