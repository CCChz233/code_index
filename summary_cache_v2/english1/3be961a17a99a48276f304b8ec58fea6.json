{"summary": "An immutable two‑dimensional vector class that supports creation via Cartesian coordinates or polar representation, provides read‑only access to x and y components, magnitude and angle (in radians or degrees), and implements arithmetic operations returning new vectors. It also offers functional helpers to generate modified copies with altered components, magnitude, or orientation.", "business_intent": "Supply a lightweight, thread‑safe vector abstraction for geometric, physics, or graphics calculations where values should not change in place and where functional updates simplify reasoning about state.", "keywords": ["immutable", "2D vector", "Cartesian", "polar", "magnitude", "angle", "radians", "degrees", "arithmetic", "functional update", "geometry", "physics", "graphics"], "summary_hash": "4d4b46061066", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:41:38+00:00"}
