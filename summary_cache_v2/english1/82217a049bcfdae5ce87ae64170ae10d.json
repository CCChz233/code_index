{"summary": "The module provides a discrete diffusion scheduler based on the KDPM2 algorithm with ancestral sampling. It supports multiple configurable noise schedules (linear, scaled, Karras, exponential, beta), handles different prediction types (epsilon, sample, v-prediction), and includes utilities for initializing timesteps, adding noise, scaling model inputs, and performing a single denoising step.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and efficient inference of diffusion models by offering a configurable KDPM2 ancestral discrete scheduler, facilitating high-quality image generation and research experimentation across various schedule and prediction configurations.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "KDPM2", "ancestral sampling", "discrete scheduler", "beta schedule", "sigma schedule", "prediction types", "noise addition", "timestep management", "denoising step"], "summary_hash": "162677d1bca5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:12:28+00:00"}
