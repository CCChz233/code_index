{"summary": "The module defines structures and utilities for automatically building and updating model cards for Sentence‑Transformer models. It provides a data class that gathers all required metadata (language, licensing, datasets, metrics, carbon‑emission info, etc.) and methods to validate, format, and serialize this information. A training callback integrates with the HuggingFace/Transformers training loop to collect training and evaluation details and produce a standardized model card. Helper functions expose simple generation and version‑retrieval capabilities.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to generate comprehensive, standards‑compliant model documentation for sentence‑transformer models with minimal manual effort, improving model transparency, reproducibility, and ease of publishing on model hubs.", "keywords": ["model card", "metadata", "sentence transformer", "training callback", "evaluation metrics", "HuggingFace", "serialization", "carbon emissions", "licensing", "datasets"], "summary_hash": "cd5705e21737", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:50:47+00:00"}
