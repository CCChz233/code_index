{"summary": "This test suite validates Prefect flow execution across different scenarios: it checks that flows run correctly under various concurrency models (asyncio, anyio, existing event loops), that crashes, cancellations, timeouts, and termination signals are properly propagated and reflected in the flow run state retrieved from the API, and that timeout behavior works for both parent and subflows in synchronous and asynchronous contexts.", "business_intent": "Provide confidence that Prefect flows behave reliably in production by ensuring correct handling of concurrency, error propagation, and timeout enforcement, thereby preventing unexpected failures and guaranteeing accurate flow run state reporting.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "flow execution", "unit testing", "concurrency", "asyncio", "anyio", "event loop", "crash handling", "cancellation", "timeout", "termination signal", "API state", "subflow"], "summary_hash": "af6eb7832a32", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:59:14+00:00"}
