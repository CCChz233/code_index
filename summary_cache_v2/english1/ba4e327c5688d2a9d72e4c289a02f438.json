{"summary": "The module implements parallel feed‑forward layers for Megatron‑style transformer models, offering both a conventional multilayer perceptron and a top‑1 mixture‑of‑experts variant. It handles tensor‑parallel computation, fused activations, optional adapter integration (e.g., LoRA), and expert routing via Sinkhorn, enabling scalable and efficient processing of large language models.", "business_intent": "Provide high‑performance, scalable feed‑forward components that accelerate training and inference of massive NLP models while supporting advanced features such as mixture‑of‑experts and adapter modules.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "parallel MLP", "feed‑forward", "tensor parallelism", "Mixture of Experts", "MoE", "adapter integration", "LoRA", "fused activation", "large‑scale NLP"], "summary_hash": "8ae445f53bb5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:08:33+00:00"}
