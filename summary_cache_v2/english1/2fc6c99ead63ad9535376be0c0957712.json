{"summary": "The module defines a custom Stable Diffusion pipeline that processes images in overlapping tiles, runs the diffusion model on each tile in latent space, and seamlessly stitches the results using Gaussian weighting to produce high‑resolution outputs. It includes a mixin for convenient latent‑to‑image conversion and utilities for mapping between pixel and latent coordinates, as well as an enumeration for different tile seeding strategies.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and artists to generate large, high‑resolution images with Stable Diffusion while managing memory usage, supporting use cases such as digital art creation, design prototyping, and high‑detail visual content generation.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "tiling", "high resolution", "image synthesis", "latent space", "Gaussian blending", "diffusion pipeline", "mixins", "tile seeding", "deep learning", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "4ba6b744ec30", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:03:03+00:00"}
