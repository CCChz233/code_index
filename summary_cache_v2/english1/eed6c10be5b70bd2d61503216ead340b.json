{"summary": "Provides utilities for managing and deploying very large neural network models that cannot fit entirely in GPU memory. It includes mechanisms to initialize model parameters lazily, offload tensors to CPU or disk, align modules across devices, construct device maps, and load checkpoints while handling tied parameters and memory constraints.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable training and inference of oversized models by automating memory-efficient placement, offloading, and checkpoint handling across heterogeneous hardware resources.", "keywords": ["large model support", "memory offloading", "CPU offload", "disk offload", "device map", "lazy weight initialization", "checkpoint loading", "torch acceleration", "hardware alignment", "parameter tying"], "summary_hash": "4e7622f14166", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:17:43+00:00"}
