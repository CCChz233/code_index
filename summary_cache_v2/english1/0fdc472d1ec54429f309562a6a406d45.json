{"summary": "Implements a training callback that automatically persists model states to disk (or cloud storage) at configurable intervals, using customizable filename patterns and selection rules based on monitored metrics, frequency, and top‑k criteria. It manages the latest and best checkpoints, supports weight‑only saving, and integrates with the trainer lifecycle for seamless checkpoint handling.", "business_intent": "Enable robust model versioning and recovery in machine‑learning pipelines by automatically storing checkpoints during training, allowing users to resume training, evaluate the best model, and manage storage efficiently.", "keywords": ["checkpoint", "model persistence", "training callback", "PyTorch Lightning", "metric monitoring", "best model", "top‑k", "frequency", "file system", "resume training", "serialization"], "summary_hash": "53dc79f81e9c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:55:58+00:00"}
