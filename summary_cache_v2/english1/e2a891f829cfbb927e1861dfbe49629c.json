{"summary": "Implements a configurable multilayer perceptron that can operate as an independent model or as a classification head stacked on pretrained encoders. Users can set the hidden dimension, number of layers, activation type, and optionally append a log‑softmax layer before the final output.", "business_intent": "Offer a flexible neural‑network component for building and fine‑tuning classification pipelines, especially when extending language models such as BERT with a custom output layer.", "keywords": ["multilayer perceptron", "MLP", "classifier head", "pretrained model integration", "BERT", "feedforward network", "hidden layers", "activation function", "log softmax", "deep learning", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "ea2fdc22a2fe", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:24:36+00:00"}
