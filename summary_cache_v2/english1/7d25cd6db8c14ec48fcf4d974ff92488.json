{"summary": "The script provides a command‑line training pipeline for the GLIGEN extension of Stable Diffusion. It parses configuration options, initializes an Accelerate accelerator for distributed and mixed‑precision training, loads the necessary diffusion components (autoencoder, UNet, text encoder), sets up optimizers and learning‑rate schedulers, manages checkpoint saving/loading, and periodically generates and logs validation images. It supports integration with Weights & Biases for experiment tracking and can resume from existing checkpoints.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to fine‑tune or train GLIGEN models for grounded text‑to‑image generation, facilitating experimentation, reproducibility, and performance monitoring in a scalable, distributed environment.", "keywords": ["GLIGEN", "Stable Diffusion", "text-to-image generation", "distributed training", "Accelerate", "diffusers", "checkpointing", "validation logging", "mixed precision", "Weights & Biases"], "summary_hash": "dde5ced03375", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:37:55+00:00"}
