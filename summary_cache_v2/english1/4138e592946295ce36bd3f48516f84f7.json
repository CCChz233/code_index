{"summary": "Implements a GraphSAGE convolutional layer that aggregates neighbor node features with a selectable reducer (mean, GCN, pooling, LSTM), optionally incorporates edge weights, concatenates the aggregated neighborhood representation with the node's own features, applies a linear transformation followed by optional dropout, bias, normalization and activation to produce updated node embeddings for homogeneous or unidirectional bipartite graphs.", "business_intent": "Provide a modular message‑passing component for inductive graph representation learning, allowing developers to stack multiple layers in deep GNN models for downstream tasks such as node classification, graph classification, or link prediction on large-scale graphs.", "keywords": ["GraphSAGE", "convolution", "neighbor aggregation", "GNN", "message passing", "mean reducer", "GCN reducer", "pooling reducer", "LSTM reducer", "edge weights", "dropout", "bias", "normalization", "activation", "homogeneous graph", "bipartite graph"], "summary_hash": "26763a2b620d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:45:21+00:00"}
