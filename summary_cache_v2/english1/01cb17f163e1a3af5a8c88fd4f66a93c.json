{"summary": "The class serves as a configurable image preprocessing engine tailored for YOLOS/DETR object detection models. It manages a pipeline that can resize images to target dimensions, optionally rescale pixel values, apply channel-wise normalization, and pad batches to uniform size. It also adapts COCO detection or panoptic annotations, updating bounding boxes and masks to match any geometric changes, and provides utilities to convert polygon masks, prepare inputs, and translate model outputs back into standard detection results.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable and consistent preparation of visual data and associated annotations for training and inference of state‑of‑the‑art object detection systems, reducing manual preprocessing effort and ensuring compatibility with COCO‑style datasets.", "keywords": ["image resizing", "pixel rescaling", "normalization", "batch padding", "COCO detection", "COCO panoptic", "annotation adjustment", "mask conversion", "object detection post‑processing", "YOLOS", "DETR"], "summary_hash": "8f05366a22ca", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:14:06+00:00"}
