{"summary": "Defines a framework for column‑level validation constraints used by the CKAN Table Designer extension, including a generic base class and concrete implementations for pattern (regex) and numeric range constraints. The classes generate CKAN validator specifications, datastore field schemas, SQL trigger rules, and Excel form validation rules, and provide registration utilities for integrating new constraints.", "business_intent": "To allow data model designers to declare and enforce consistent validation rules on individual columns across CKAN, the underlying datastore, and Excel import/export processes, ensuring data quality and integrity through reusable constraint definitions.", "keywords": ["CKAN", "Table Designer", "column constraint", "validation", "regex pattern", "numeric range", "datastore schema", "SQL trigger", "Excel validation", "data integrity"], "summary_hash": "9e3680e4db2f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T19:18:58+00:00"}
