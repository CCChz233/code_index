{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe must not list method names verbatim. So we need to describe class responsibility: XPOTrainer is a trainer for eXtreme Preference Optimization (XPO) using online DPO config. It handles model, reference model, reward model, judge, data collator, datasets, processing class, PEFT config, metrics, callbacks, optimizers, etc. It computes log probabilities, rewards, losses, generates completions, processes them, logs statistics, computes judge decisions, training step, etc. Business intent: to fine-tune language models with preference-based reinforcement learning using pairwise comparisons and reward modeling, enabling better alignment with human preferences.
