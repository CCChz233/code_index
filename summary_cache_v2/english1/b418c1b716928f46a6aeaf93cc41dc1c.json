{"summary": "Defines a diffusion pipeline that combines the Flux text‑to‑image model with ControlNet conditioning. The pipeline manages tokenization, prompt embedding, latent preparation, iterative denoising via a transformer and scheduler, optional classifier‑free guidance, and decoding through a VAE, while supporting single or multiple ControlNet models for extra visual cues.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and enterprises to generate high‑quality images from textual prompts, optionally guided by additional control maps, for applications such as content creation, design prototyping, and AI‑augmented media production.", "keywords": ["Flux", "ControlNet", "text-to-image", "diffusion pipeline", "VAE", "CLIP", "T5", "scheduler", "guidance scaling", "latent processing", "AI image generation"], "summary_hash": "7f52c645c18a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:19:20+00:00"}
