{"summary": "The module defines graph‑based loss classes for automatic speech recognition using the k2 library. It implements Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss with multiple topology options and self‑loop handling, a generic maximum‑likelihood loss wrapper that prepares and intersects target and prediction FSAs, and an RNNT loss that builds a minimal topology with optional pruning. The classes accept explicit parameters or configuration objects and integrate mixins for k2‑specific functionality.", "business_intent": "Provide flexible, configurable loss computations for training speech‑recognition models, enabling efficient maximum‑likelihood training of CTC and RNNT models with customizable graph topologies.", "keywords": ["ASR", "CTC loss", "RNNT loss", "k2", "graph topology", "maximum likelihood", "speech recognition training", "neural network loss", "configurable loss", "sequence modeling"], "summary_hash": "c17cf3729021", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:13:34+00:00"}
