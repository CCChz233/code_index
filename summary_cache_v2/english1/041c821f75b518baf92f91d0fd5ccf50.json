{"summary": "The module supplies utilities for adding, managing, and removing overlapping regions between Dask array chunks. It implements functions to pad chunks according to various boundary modes (constant, reflect, periodic, nearest), to trim the added padding after computation, and to construct a high‑level graph layer that represents these overlap operations. The core purpose is to enable chunk‑wise operations that need neighboring data, such as stencil or convolution kernels, by providing a systematic way to extend and later trim chunk boundaries.", "business_intent": "Enable distributed array algorithms that depend on neighboring values—like convolutions, filters, or finite‑difference stencils—to run efficiently on Dask by automatically handling the required overlap and boundary conditions across chunk partitions.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "overlap", "chunk padding", "boundary handling", "map_overlap", "stencil computation", "convolution", "high‑level graph", "trim overlap"], "summary_hash": "ccb9a6b0bf58", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:17:15+00:00"}
