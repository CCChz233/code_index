{"summary": "The module defines comprehensive test suites for the Stable Diffusion Upscale pipeline, including lightweight fast unit tests with mock components and full integration tests using real models. It validates core capabilities such as single‑image and batch upscaling, half‑precision execution, loading pretrained weights, prompt embedding handling, and CPU offloading, ensuring deterministic and reliable behavior across different hardware configurations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of the AI image upscaling service, enabling developers to confidently deploy and maintain the Stable Diffusion Upscale pipeline in production environments.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "upscale", "pipeline", "unit tests", "integration tests", "image upscaling", "fp16", "batch processing", "prompt embeddings", "determinism", "GPU", "CPU offloading", "diffusers", "torch"], "summary_hash": "d76f05677f3b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:50:56+00:00"}
