{"summary": "The module offers a high‑level runner that configures, launches, and processes camera efficiency simulations using the sim_telarray testeff tool for a given telescope model. It handles input parameters (zenith angle, NSB spectrum), builds the execution command, runs the simulation via a generic SimtelRunner, validates the results, and extracts one‑dimensional efficiency distributions.", "business_intent": "Enable CTA and related projects to automatically generate accurate camera efficiency curves for telescope designs, supporting performance studies, calibration, and optimization workflows.", "keywords": ["camera efficiency", "simulation", "sim_telarray", "testeff", "telescope model", "zenith angle", "night sky background", "command generation", "output validation", "efficiency distribution", "CTA"], "summary_hash": "cb3059eca383", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:52:28+00:00"}
