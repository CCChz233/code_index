{"summary": "This module defines unit tests for Qiskit’s transpiler preset pass managers targeting a single‑qubit backend. It includes a suite of deliberately failing tests to verify the test harness’s failure detection and a suite of passing tests that validate basic transpilation, hardware interface, and simulated backend behavior, using simple helper circuits.", "business_intent": "Validate that the transpiler’s preset passes work correctly with a 1‑qubit fake device, ensure that both real‑like and simulated backends operate as expected, and confirm that the testing framework reliably captures failures.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "transpiler", "preset pass manager", "1‑qubit backend", "unit testing", "failure detection", "validation", "quantum circuit", "fake provider", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "7be02309b55e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:49:08+00:00"}
