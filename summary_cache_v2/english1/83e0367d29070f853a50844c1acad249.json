{"summary": "The plasma module delivers a comprehensive, object‑oriented framework for representing and analyzing plasma systems. It defines a core plasma interface and generic implementation for computing fundamental plasma properties, and supplies specialized equilibrium models for cylindrical configurations and one‑dimensional current sheets, together with supporting grid utilities. The package handles physical units and provides methods to evaluate magnetic fields, pressure balance, and related quantities across various geometries.", "business_intent": "To enable researchers and engineers in fusion, space physics, and plasma device development to efficiently simulate and study plasma behavior, facilitating design, diagnostics, and theoretical investigations through a validated, unit‑aware computational toolkit.", "keywords": ["plasma modeling", "equilibrium analysis", "magnetic field", "pressure profile", "cylindrical geometry", "1D current sheet", "unit-aware calculations", "scientific computing", "fusion research", "space physics"], "summary_hash": "9770732e83ae", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:14:11+00:00"}
