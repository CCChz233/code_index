{"summary": "A command‑line script that sets up an unsupervised InfoGraph training pipeline on graph datasets using DGL and PyTorch. It parses arguments, defines a collate helper for graph batching, loads a GIN dataset, trains the InfoGraph model, and evaluates the learned node embeddings.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example for researchers and engineers to apply unsupervised graph representation learning with InfoGraph, facilitating experimentation and benchmarking of graph embeddings for downstream tasks.", "keywords": ["unsupervised learning", "graph neural network", "InfoGraph", "DGL", "PyTorch", "embedding evaluation", "GINDataset", "GraphDataLoader", "collate function", "command line interface"], "summary_hash": "8d692e6744ce", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:22:03+00:00"}
