{"summary": "The module implements lazy adapters that read NeMo speech manifests—both plain JSON and tarred JSON formats—and convert each entry into Lhotse Cut objects. It extracts essential audio information, maps optional fields such as sampling rate, offset, language, and preserves any extra manifest keys as custom metadata. The tarred iterator also handles shard shuffling, pipe‑based file specifications, and on‑the‑fly extraction from tar archives, enabling scalable streaming of large, sharded corpora.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑performance bridge for loading NeMo‑formatted speech corpora into Lhotse pipelines, facilitating efficient data ingestion, preprocessing, and training of speech models on massive datasets, including cloud‑based and sharded storage scenarios.", "keywords": ["NeMo", "Lhotse", "lazy iterator", "speech dataset", "manifest conversion", "tarred shards", "streaming", "custom metadata", "audio preprocessing", "large‑scale data loading"], "summary_hash": "29a16dfdb7c4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:54:09+00:00"}
