{"summary": "The package implements Dask's Bag abstraction, a lazily evaluated, partitioned collection of generic Python objects that can be processed in parallel. It includes core operations (map, filter, groupby, fold, repartition), utilities for reading data from text and Avro files, random sampling helpers, and low‑level chunk‑level functions for grouping, aggregation, and synchronization, all built on HighLevelGraph and fsspec for scalable execution.", "business_intent": "Provide a simple, high‑level API for distributed, out‑of‑core data processing on unstructured or semi‑structured datasets, enabling users to perform map‑reduce style transformations, read/write common file formats, and perform statistical sampling across many workers.", "keywords": ["dask", "bag", "parallel processing", "lazy evaluation", "partitioned collection", "map", "filter", "groupby", "fold", "repartition", "highlevelgraph", "fsspec", "avro", "text", "random sampling", "chunk utilities", "distributed computing"], "summary_hash": "1d24e63e6a97", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:27:07+00:00"}
