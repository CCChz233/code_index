{"summary": "The module implements a diffusion pipeline that incorporates layout information extracted from large language model responses into Stable Diffusion image generation. It provides an attention processor capable of invoking custom hooks to inspect or modify attention tensors during diffusion, and integrates adapter modules to inject spatial constraints, while handling safety checking and standard diffusion steps.", "business_intent": "Enable AI-driven content creation where textual prompts are automatically translated into spatially aware image layouts, supporting designers, marketers, and developers who need precise object placement in generated visuals.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "large language model", "layout constraints", "attention hook", "image generation", "text-to-image", "safety checking", "adapter modules", "AI content creation"], "summary_hash": "fa39051e9bcb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:01:25+00:00"}
