{"summary": "A command‑line script that configures and launches training of a speech‑to‑text transformer model for speech translation using NVIDIA NeMo. It parses Hydra configurations to set dataset manifests, tokenizer details, trainer options (including distributed training), optimizer parameters, and experiment logging (e.g., Weights & Biases), then initiates the model's training loop.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to efficiently train and evaluate speech translation models with a flexible, reproducible pipeline that integrates data handling, tokenization, hyperparameter tuning, and experiment tracking.", "keywords": ["speech translation", "speech-to-text", "transformer", "model training", "NVIDIA NeMo", "Hydra configuration", "tokenizer", "optimizer", "distributed training", "experiment logging", "Weights & Biases"], "summary_hash": "55a202436dac", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:40:02+00:00"}
