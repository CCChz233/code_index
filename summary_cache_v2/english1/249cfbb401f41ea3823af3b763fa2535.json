{"summary": "Implements a Qiskit transpiler pass that routes a quantum circuit onto a specific hardware coupling map by stochastically inserting swap operations. The pass works on the circuit's DAG representation, handles control‑flow blocks, and strives to preserve measurement semantics while finding a suitable qubit layout.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum programs to be executed on real quantum hardware with limited qubit connectivity by automatically adding swap gates and optimizing qubit placement, thereby improving the reliability and performance of compiled circuits.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "transpiler", "stochastic routing", "swap insertion", "coupling map", "qubit layout", "control flow", "measurement preservation", "DAG", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "5ec1966f47fa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:27:34+00:00"}
