{"summary": "Implements a global attention pooling operation for graph‑structured data, where a gate network produces attention scores for each node, optionally a feature network transforms node features, and the weighted sum (softmax over scores) yields a fixed‑size graph representation.", "business_intent": "Provides a TensorFlow layer that aggregates variable‑length node embeddings into a single vector, facilitating downstream graph‑level tasks such as classification, regression, or similarity learning in graph neural networks.", "keywords": ["global attention", "pooling", "graph neural network", "aggregation", "softmax", "gate network", "feature transformation", "TensorFlow", "layer"], "summary_hash": "e08eedc5c51f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:50:17+00:00"}
