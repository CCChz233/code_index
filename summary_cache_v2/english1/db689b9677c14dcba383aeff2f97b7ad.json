{"summary": "This module implements a legacy diffusion-based audio generation pipeline that converts audio waveforms to mel‑spectrograms, encodes them, runs a conditional UNet denoiser with configurable diffusion schedulers, and decodes the latent representation back to waveforms. It also provides utilities for creating, normalizing, and optionally visualizing mel‑spectrograms.", "business_intent": "To enable research and prototyping of diffusion models for audio synthesis, offering a reference implementation that demonstrates how to generate realistic sound from latent diffusion processes.", "keywords": ["audio diffusion", "mel spectrogram", "UNet denoiser", "diffusion scheduler", "waveform synthesis", "latent encoding", "audio generation", "deprecated pipeline", "signal processing"], "summary_hash": "fc4f85452b6e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:44:18+00:00"}
