{"summary": "A TensorFlow implementation of a single encoder layer for the Whisper speech‑to‑text model. It encapsulates the self‑attention mechanism, feed‑forward network, layer normalisation and residual connections that transform acoustic token embeddings into higher‑level representations.", "business_intent": "Serve as a reusable building block for constructing the Whisper encoder stack, enabling developers to assemble and train speech recognition models efficiently within TensorFlow.", "keywords": ["TensorFlow", "Whisper", "encoder layer", "self‑attention", "feed‑forward", "transformer", "speech recognition", "neural network", "model component"], "summary_hash": "2eca9fb112b1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:55:36+00:00"}
