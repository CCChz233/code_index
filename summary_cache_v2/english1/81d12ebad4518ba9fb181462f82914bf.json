{"summary": "The module offers utilities for detecting and handling overlapping regions of interest (ROIs) according to version‑1 table specifications. It provides mechanisms to assess overlap in one, two, or three dimensions, retrieve overlapping ROI pairs, and apply positional shifts, with additional placeholders for overlap removal and checks.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that ROI definitions in imaging datasets are mutually exclusive, preventing data conflicts and ensuring reliable downstream analysis such as image stitching or quantitative measurements.", "keywords": ["ROI", "overlap detection", "dimensional overlap", "microscopy", "field of view", "data integrity", "spatial shift", "pair extraction"], "summary_hash": "682d99bf7c16", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:57:40+00:00"}
