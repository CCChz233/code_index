{"summary": "The script demonstrates how to accelerate and shrink a SentenceTransformer model through knowledge distillation. It trains a lightweight student model to mimic the embeddings of a high‑performing teacher model using a diverse corpus (SNLI, Multi‑NLI, Wikipedia). Two student initialization strategies are supported: training a compact transformer from scratch (e.g., TinyBERT) or retaining only a subset of the teacher's layers. The workflow includes data preparation, optional sentence combination and deduplication, embedding mapping, training configuration, loss definition, evaluation with embedding similarity, and model saving.", "business_intent": "Guide developers and NLP engineers in creating fast, low‑resource sentence embedding services by compressing large transformer models while maintaining near‑teacher quality, enabling deployment in latency‑sensitive or resource‑constrained environments.", "keywords": ["knowledge distillation", "sentence embeddings", "model compression", "layer reduction", "TinyBERT", "SentenceTransformer", "speed optimization", "performance trade‑off", "SNLI", "Multi‑NLI", "Wikipedia dataset", "embedding similarity evaluator"], "summary_hash": "6732f1afd9b8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:58:08+00:00"}
