{"summary": "Implements a bilinear decoder that transforms paired node embeddings from a bipartite graph into class probability scores for each edge. It computes a bilinear product between the two embeddings using a class‑specific weight matrix that is expressed as a linear combination of a small set of basis matrices, applies dropout, and normalizes with softmax. Includes utilities for parameter initialization and forward inference.", "business_intent": "Enables edge‑type prediction or link‑strength estimation in recommendation or relational modeling scenarios, such as determining the likelihood of a user‑movie interaction belonging to a particular category.", "keywords": ["bilinear decoder", "bipartite graph", "edge classification", "softmax", "basis matrix decomposition", "latent embeddings", "dropout", "parameter initialization"], "summary_hash": "ff2803168d87", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:14:12+00:00"}
