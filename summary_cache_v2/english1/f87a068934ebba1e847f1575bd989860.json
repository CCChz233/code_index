{"summary": "This module implements data handling and utility routines for fine‑tuning a Stable Diffusion inpainting model with DreamBooth using low‑rank adaptation (LoRA). It defines dataset classes that load instance and class images, apply masks, tokenize prompts, and supply collated batches, as well as helper functions for mask creation and argument parsing, supporting training workflows with the Accelerate library.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use pipeline for creating customized inpainting models that can generate personalized content based on user‑specific images and prompts, enabling businesses to deliver tailored visual generation services.", "keywords": ["DreamBooth", "inpainting", "LoRA", "fine-tuning", "Stable Diffusion", "dataset", "mask preparation", "diffusion models", "PyTorch", "Hugging Face", "Accelerate"], "summary_hash": "1c6813787f3a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:07:29+00:00"}
