{"summary": "This module offers utilities for handling unpacked NeMo model checkpoint directories, providing access to model metadata, configuration, and tokenizer assets. It includes helpers for adapting tokenizer special tokens, extracting model layers by name prefix, and translating NeMo checkpoint information into a generic LLM configuration suitable for TensorRT-LLM deployment.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the conversion and export of NeMo language models to TensorRT-LLM format, streamlining model deployment and inference optimization on GPU/CPU platforms.", "keywords": ["NeMo", "checkpoint", "TensorRT-LLM", "model conversion", "tokenizer", "layer extraction", "configuration", "GPU", "CPU", "Falcon", "GPT2", "Llama", "yaml", "torch"], "summary_hash": "30d9505a02e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:40:16+00:00"}
