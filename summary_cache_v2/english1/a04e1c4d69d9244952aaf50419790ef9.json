{"summary": "SparsePauliOp is a data structure that encodes an N‑qubit quantum operator as a weighted sum of Pauli strings, storing only the non‑zero terms. It leverages a Pauli list for the string labels and a NumPy array for the complex coefficients, enabling efficient arithmetic, tensoring, adjoint, and conversion operations while remaining memory‑efficient for large systems with few terms.", "business_intent": "Offer a scalable, high‑performance tool for constructing, manipulating, and simulating quantum operators that are sparse in the Pauli basis, supporting applications such as Hamiltonian modeling, circuit synthesis, parameter optimization, and integration with Qiskit’s quantum‑information and simulation workflows.", "keywords": ["quantum", "Pauli", "sparse", "operator", "N-qubit", "linear combination", "coefficients", "tensor product", "adjoint", "simulation", "Hamiltonian", "circuit synthesis", "parameter optimization", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "8d6c51af8df6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:08:21+00:00"}
