{"summary": "Utility that converts arbitrary Python objects—including scalars, strings, NumPy arrays, PyTorch tensors, dictionaries, lists, and tuples—into a specified target type (either a PyTorch Tensor or a NumPy array). It supports dtype casting, device placement for tensors, optional wrapping as MetaTensor, and can recursively process sequence containers when wrap_sequence is disabled.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable, automated way to normalize input data to a consistent tensor or array format for deep‑learning and medical‑imaging pipelines, reducing preprocessing boilerplate and ensuring compatibility with downstream MONAI components.", "keywords": ["type conversion", "tensor", "numpy array", "dtype casting", "device placement", "MetaTensor", "recursive sequence handling", "data normalization", "preprocessing utility"], "summary_hash": "dd826f43b01c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:56:34+00:00"}
