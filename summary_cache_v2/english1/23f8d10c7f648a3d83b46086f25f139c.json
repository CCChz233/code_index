{"summary": "Defines a flexible 2‑dimensional Transformer model that tokenizes latent image maps into patches, applies multi‑head self‑attention (and optional cross‑attention), adaptive layer normalization, and configurable dropout/normalization layers. The model is designed as a core component for diffusion‑based image generation pipelines, allowing customization of attention processors and embedding projections.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, configurable transformer backbone for high‑quality image synthesis in diffusion models, enabling developers to tailor attention mechanisms and normalization strategies for improved generation performance.", "keywords": ["2D transformer", "self-attention", "cross-attention", "patch embedding", "adaptive layer norm", "diffusion model", "image generation", "latent representation", "attention processor", "torch", "dropout", "normalization"], "summary_hash": "2cad20088521", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:30:05+00:00"}
