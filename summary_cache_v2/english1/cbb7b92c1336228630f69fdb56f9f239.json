{"summary": "This module provides test utilities and a test case aimed at validating the behavior of sparse node embeddings under multiprocessing in a PyTorch environment using DGL. It includes helper routines for initializing embeddings and launching worker processes, as well as a test that attempts to set and retrieve embedding values concurrently.", "business_intent": "Ensure that sparse embedding operations are correctly synchronized and functional when accessed from multiple processes, supporting reliable distributed training and inference workflows.", "keywords": ["sparse embedding", "multiprocessing", "PyTorch", "DGL", "node embedding", "unit test", "concurrency", "initialization"], "summary_hash": "8d23d26e08d5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:07:25+00:00"}
