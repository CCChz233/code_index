{"summary": "The module defines a Flax‑based scheduler that implements the variance‑exploding stochastic differential equation (SDE) used in score‑based diffusion models. It manages the noise‑scale schedule, timesteps, and provides the prediction‑correction steps required for sampling, along with data structures to hold scheduler state and step outputs.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient inference for generative AI applications that rely on diffusion models by providing a JAX/Flax implementation of the VE‑SDE sampling algorithm, facilitating high‑performance generation of synthetic data such as images or audio.", "keywords": ["diffusion models", "variance exploding", "SDE", "Flax", "JAX", "scheduler", "sampling", "generative AI", "noise schedule", "score-based"], "summary_hash": "ace48daafad7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:13:48+00:00"}
