{"summary": "Applies random affine transformations—including scaling, translation, rotation, and shear—to images and their associated annotations (masks, keypoints, bounding boxes). Configurable parameters control the magnitude and sampling of each transformation, interpolation method, fill values for newly created pixels, border handling, output size fitting, aspect‑ratio preservation, balanced scaling, and the probability of execution.", "business_intent": "Enhance computer‑vision model training by generating diverse geometric variations of input data, improving model robustness to spatial changes while keeping image, mask, keypoint, and bounding‑box consistency.", "keywords": ["affine transformation", "image augmentation", "scaling", "translation", "rotation", "shear", "interpolation", "fill value", "border mode", "output fitting", "aspect ratio preservation", "balanced scaling", "probability", "computer vision", "data augmentation", "masks", "keypoints", "bounding boxes"], "summary_hash": "735fdc31d09f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:25:27+00:00"}
