{"summary": "A collection of unit tests that validate the job manager's behavior for various job submission back‑ends (local, GridEngine, HTCondor). The tests employ mocks to simulate filesystem interactions, subprocess calls and logging, checking that commands are built correctly, logs are captured, and errors are raised as expected.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the job execution component of the simulation framework reliably handles different submission systems, produces correct log output and proper error handling, thereby supporting stable automated workflows.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "job manager", "submission systems", "mocking", "logging", "error handling", "simulation tools"], "summary_hash": "e7487c4c4633", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:54:38+00:00"}
