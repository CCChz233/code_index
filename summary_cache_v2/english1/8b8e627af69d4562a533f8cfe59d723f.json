{"summary": "Implements the Bootstrap Graph Representation Learning (BGRL) model, encapsulating an online encoder, a target encoder that is a copy of the online encoder, and a predictor that maps the online encoder output toward the target projection. The class handles model initialization, forward computation of graph embeddings, provides access to trainable parameters, and updates the target encoder parameters using a momentum‑based moving average.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use self‑supervised graph embedding component that can be integrated into downstream graph analytics pipelines, reducing the need for labeled data while delivering high‑quality node and graph representations.", "keywords": ["graph representation learning", "self-supervised", "online encoder", "target encoder", "predictor", "momentum update", "PyTorch", "embedding"], "summary_hash": "0db2e95fd19e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:08:15+00:00"}
