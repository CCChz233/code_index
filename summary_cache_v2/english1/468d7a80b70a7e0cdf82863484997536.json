{"summary": "The module contains unit tests that verify the behavior of the intensity clipping transform based on percentile thresholds. It checks both hard and soft clipping modes, per‑channel handling, and illumination adjustments for 2‑D images and 3‑D volumes, ensuring that the transform respects lower/upper percentile limits and sharpness settings.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correctness of intensity preprocessing steps used in medical imaging pipelines, supporting reliable model training and inference by catching regressions in the clipping functionality.", "keywords": ["intensity clipping", "percentile thresholds", "hard clip", "soft clip", "2D images", "3D volumes", "unit testing", "medical imaging", "MONAI", "channel-wise processing", "illumination adjustment"], "summary_hash": "d68b03da50e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:57:50+00:00"}
