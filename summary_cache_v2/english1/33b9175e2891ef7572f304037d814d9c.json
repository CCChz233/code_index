{"summary": "This module implements a diffusion pipeline that combines Stable Diffusion XL with ControlNet to perform text‑guided image generation and inpainting. It coordinates dual CLIP text encoders, a VAE, a conditional UNet, ControlNet, and various schedulers to preprocess inputs, encode prompts, apply controlled noise, and decode latents into edited images. Helper utilities for noise scaling and latent handling are also provided.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and creative professionals to generate and edit high‑quality images using natural language prompts while applying precise spatial control, supporting use cases such as content creation, visual design, advertising, and visual effects.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "inpainting", "ControlNet", "Stable Diffusion XL", "text-to-image", "CLIP", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "pipeline", "image generation", "AI", "generative models", "image editing"], "summary_hash": "85ce8d87aad3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:17:35+00:00"}
