{"summary": "This module implements the core of Django’s template engine. It tokenizes raw template strings, parses the token stream into an abstract syntax tree of node objects, resolves variables and filter expressions against a context, and renders the resulting output. The primary public interface is the Template class, which compiles a template and provides a render method. Supporting classes handle lexical tokens, node collections, variable lookup, filter processing, and debugging of the lexer.", "business_intent": "To give developers a powerful, safe, and reusable way to generate text (typically HTML) by mixing static markup with dynamic data, allowing templates to be compiled once and rendered many times with different contexts while supporting custom tags, filters, and automatic escaping.", "keywords": ["template engine", "lexer", "parser", "node tree", "rendering", "context", "variable resolution", "filters", "tags", "HTML escaping", "Django"], "summary_hash": "8dcdb375f984", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:22:10+00:00"}
