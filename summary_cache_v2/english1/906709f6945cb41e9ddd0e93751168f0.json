{"summary": "Defines an abstract base class that implements the core logic for diffusion‑model samplers used in stable diffusion text‑to‑image pipelines. It creates sampling schedules, extracts model predictions, updates internal state buffers, and provides common sampling algorithms such as DPM and DDIM, while delegating model‑specific details to subclasses.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and reusable sampling mechanisms for generating images from text prompts in production‑grade stable diffusion systems, facilitating research, customization, and deployment of high‑quality text‑to‑image models.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "sampler", "stable diffusion", "text-to-image", "DPM", "DDIM", "sampling schedule", "model output extraction", "state update", "abstract base class", "PyTorch", "numpy", "tqdm"], "summary_hash": "a9b6da28e2c0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:07:05+00:00"}
