{"summary": "This module implements the core components for handling graphs that are split across multiple machines in a distributed setting. It provides a client‑side graph abstraction that loads partition metadata, connects to remote servers, and offers graph‑like operations (node/edge queries, attribute access, neighbor sampling) while optionally using shared memory for local partitions. It also defines a server that hosts a single graph partition and exposes its structure and data via RPC, along with lightweight request/response messages for initializing shared‑memory representations. Additional view objects give dictionary‑style access to node and edge attributes for both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, and a collection of internal utilities support shared‑memory management and partition splitting.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to train and infer graph neural networks on very large graphs by abstracting the complexities of distributed storage, partitioning, and inter‑process communication, while presenting a familiar graph API that works seamlessly in both single‑machine and multi‑machine environments.", "keywords": ["distributed graph", "graph neural network", "graph partitioning", "RPC server", "shared memory", "node attributes", "edge attributes", "heterogeneous graph", "mini‑batch sampling", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "dc2a7b427d01", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:38:35+00:00"}
