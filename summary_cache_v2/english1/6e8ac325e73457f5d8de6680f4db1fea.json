{"summary": "SegResNet implements a configurable encoder‑decoder convolutional network for 2D or 3D medical image segmentation, originally designed for brain tumor delineation in MRI. It builds hierarchical feature maps through stacked down‑sampling blocks, processes them with residual convolutions, and reconstructs spatial resolution via up‑sampling blocks, optionally adding a final convolutional head. The architecture allows customization of input/output channels, filter counts, activation, normalization, dropout, and up‑sampling strategy.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use deep learning model for automated segmentation of brain tumors (or other anatomical structures) in MRI scans, supporting research, clinical workflow integration, and development of diagnostic or treatment‑planning tools.", "keywords": ["medical image segmentation", "MRI", "brain tumor", "encoder‑decoder network", "residual blocks", "downsampling", "upsampling", "convolutional neural network", "MONAI", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "7209c0f0cf63", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:36:14+00:00"}
