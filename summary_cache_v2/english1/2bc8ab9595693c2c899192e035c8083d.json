{"summary": "A compact variational autoencoder that converts images into low‑dimensional latent tensors and reconstructs images from those latents. It offers configurable channel dimensions, block depths, activation functions, and latent scaling parameters, with support for tiled processing, precision upcasting, and latent scaling/unscaling.", "business_intent": "Supply a lightweight, memory‑efficient encoder‑decoder for high‑resolution image workflows, particularly as the front‑end of latent diffusion models, enabling fast image compression, storage, and generation with reduced computational overhead.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "latent representation", "image encoding", "image decoding", "lightweight model", "configurable architecture", "latent scaling", "diffusion models", "tiling", "precision upcasting"], "summary_hash": "118da6734282", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:33:40+00:00"}
