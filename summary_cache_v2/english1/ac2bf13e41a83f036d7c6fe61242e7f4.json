{"summary": "A command‑line example that configures and runs fine‑tuning of a Megatron‑T5 language model using NVIDIA NeMo. It parses a Hydra configuration, sets up experiment management, logging, and a PyTorch Lightning Trainer with distributed data‑parallel, mixed‑precision, and custom progress bar plugins, loads the Megatron‑T5 model, and executes the training loop.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and engineers to quickly adapt large Megatron‑T5 models for language‑modeling tasks with scalable, mixed‑precision training and reproducible experiment tracking.", "keywords": ["Megatron T5", "language modeling", "fine‑tuning", "NVIDIA NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "distributed training", "mixed precision", "Hydra", "experiment management"], "summary_hash": "a8a4c07f405b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:43:36+00:00"}
