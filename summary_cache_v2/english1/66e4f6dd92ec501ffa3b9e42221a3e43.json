{"summary": "This module implements a step decorator that enforces a configurable execution timeout for Metaflow steps, aborting the step when the combined seconds, minutes, and hours limit is exceeded. It integrates with Metaflow's retry and catch mechanisms, handles unbounded foreach control, and includes a helper to retrieve the runtime limit for a task.", "business_intent": "Allow workflow authors to define maximum execution durations for steps so that overly long steps are terminated, resources are managed efficiently, and retry/catch logic can respond appropriately.", "keywords": ["timeout", "decorator", "Metaflow", "step execution", "runtime limit", "signal alarm", "retry", "catch", "unbounded foreach", "exception handling", "resource management"], "summary_hash": "abbe711ebb70", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:21:36+00:00"}
