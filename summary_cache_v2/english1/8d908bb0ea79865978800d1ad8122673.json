Includes a convenience constructor for a high‑probability emergency symptom and implements standard equality and hashing behavior.", "business_intent": "Enable health‑care utilization models and decision‑support tools to estimate how different symptoms drive non‑emergency and emergency care demand across age groups.", "keywords": ["symptom", "healthcare seeking", "emergency care probability", "odds ratio", "adult", "child", "data model", "equality", "hashable"], "summary_hash": "441e1a0e7d8e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:17:08+00:00"}
