{"summary": "This module defines lightweight containers for grouping MAPDL entity identifiers by type and a manager that oversees collections of such groups. The containers support sequence‑like indexing, iteration, and clear string representations, while the manager offers dictionary‑style access, creation, modification, and retrieval of component sets, handling default entity classifications and warning mechanisms.", "business_intent": "Enable users of the ANSYS MAPDL Python API to organize, select, and manipulate sets of model entities (e.g., nodes, elements, keypoints) efficiently, facilitating batch operations and streamlined interaction with MAPDL's component system.", "keywords": ["component", "entity grouping", "MAPDL", "ANSYS", "container", "manager", "selection", "default entity type", "iteration", "indexing", "warning handling"], "summary_hash": "5ff40b5763d8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:58:32+00:00"}
