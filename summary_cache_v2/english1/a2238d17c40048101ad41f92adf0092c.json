{"summary": "The package supplies core utilities for NeMo multimodal data pipelines, offering thread‑safe epoch tracking, random URL sampling, and a generic dataset wrapper that abstracts WebDataset shard access from local files or S3. It handles distributed partitioning, size estimation, deterministic shuffling, and reproducible ordering, enabling seamless integration with PyTorch data loaders for large‑scale multimodal training.", "business_intent": "Facilitate reliable, scalable, and reproducible loading of multimodal datasets across distributed training environments, reducing engineering effort and improving performance for AI model development.", "keywords": ["multimodal", "data loading", "WebDataset", "S3", "distributed training", "epoch counter", "sampler", "deterministic shuffling", "reproducibility", "PyTorch DataLoader"], "summary_hash": "8040a0c44ca8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:04:45+00:00"}
