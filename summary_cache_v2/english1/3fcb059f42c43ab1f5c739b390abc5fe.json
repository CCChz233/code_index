{"summary": "OneOf encapsulates a collection of callable transforms and, when invoked, randomly selects a single transform based on user‑defined probabilities. It supports applying the chosen transform to each element of list‑like inputs, optional argument unpacking, configurable logging, lazy resampling to minimise recomputation, and runtime overrides of common transform parameters.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, probabilistic component for data‑augmentation pipelines that enables stochastic selection of operations while supporting efficient lazy execution and dynamic parameter overrides.", "keywords": ["random selection", "transform pipeline", "probability weights", "lazy execution", "parameter overrides", "logging", "map items", "unpack items"], "summary_hash": "0f130032828d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:05:52+00:00"}
