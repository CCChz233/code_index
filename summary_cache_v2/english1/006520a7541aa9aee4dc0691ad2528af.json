{"summary": "The module defines a collection of built‑in plugins that assemble and configure PassManager objects for the different stages of Qiskit’s transpilation flow (layout selection, routing, scheduling, optimization, and basis translation). Each plugin encapsulates the logic required to choose appropriate algorithms (e.g., Sabre, BasicSwap, LookaheadSwap, stochastic swap, ALAP/ASAP scheduling) and to chain the necessary passes, handling special cases such as missing layouts or routing failures.", "business_intent": "Provide a modular, extensible set of ready‑to‑use components that automate the construction of stage‑specific pass pipelines, simplifying the creation of efficient quantum circuit compilation workflows and enabling consistent, high‑performance transpilation across diverse hardware targets.", "keywords": ["quantum compilation", "transpiler", "pass manager", "plugin architecture", "layout optimization", "routing algorithms", "scheduling", "circuit optimization", "basis translation", "Sabre", "BasicSwap", "LookaheadSwap", "stochastic swap", "ALAP", "ASAP", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "db4a696fdc6c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:23:35+00:00"}
