{"summary": "The module presents an instructional implementation of a Capsule Network using the Deep Graph Library (DGL). It defines a routing layer that performs capsule routing with a squashing non‑linearity, shows how to construct a simple graph to serve as the capsule structure, and includes visualization helpers to animate the routing process. The code emphasizes conceptual clarity over performance.", "business_intent": "Provide an educational example for researchers and developers to understand and experiment with capsule networks and graph‑based routing, serving as a learning resource rather than a production‑ready solution.", "keywords": ["capsule network", "routing layer", "graph neural network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "squashing function", "tutorial", "visualization", "animation", "bipartite graph"], "summary_hash": "db1c88623c17", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:58:43+00:00"}
