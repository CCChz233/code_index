{"summary": "This module implements Python wrappers around the NVIDIA cuSPARSE library for CuPy. It defines descriptor classes that encapsulate metadata for dense matrices, dense vectors, and sparse matrices, and provides a suite of utility functions that invoke cuSPARSE routines for format conversion, sorting, and sparse linear algebra operations such as multiplication and addition. Although many of the functions are currently unused or untested, the module serves as the core interface for GPU‑accelerated sparse computations within CuPy.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑performance, GPU‑based sparse matrix and vector operations in scientific and machine‑learning applications by exposing cuSPARSE functionality through CuPy's Python API.", "keywords": ["cuSPARSE", "GPU", "sparse matrix", "dense matrix", "vector", "descriptor", "format conversion", "matrix multiplication", "linear algebra", "CuPy", "CUDA"], "summary_hash": "c3a7080dde4b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:17:56+00:00"}
