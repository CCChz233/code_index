{"summary": "The module provides a collection of image preprocessing utilities tailored for diffusion model pipelines. It includes processors that resize images to model‑specific dimensions, apply resampling filters, convert color spaces, normalize pixel values, and optionally binarize masks or depth maps. Additionally, it offers functionality to reverse these transformations for visualisation, and simple helpers for basic image validation.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless preparation and post‑processing of visual data for generative diffusion models, ensuring inputs meet the size, format, and value constraints required by VAE and other model components, thereby improving model performance and usability.", "keywords": ["image preprocessing", "diffusion models", "VAE", "resizing", "normalization", "binarization", "color conversion", "depth map", "mask processing", "PIL", "torch"], "summary_hash": "5eae773059dd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:08:59+00:00"}
