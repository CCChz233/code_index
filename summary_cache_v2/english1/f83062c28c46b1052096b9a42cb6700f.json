{"summary": "Provides the infrastructure for handling Cython compiler configuration, including a class that stores and normalises compilation options, applies language‑specific defaults, validates values, and produces a unique fingerprint for a given option set. It also defines utilities for copying option objects, accessing directive defaults, normalising encodings, and parsing directive values, though many of these helpers are currently unused.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and reproducible configuration of the Cython compilation process by managing compiler options and directives, supporting language‑specific defaults, and ensuring consistent builds through option fingerprinting.", "keywords": ["Cython", "compiler", "options", "configuration", "directives", "defaults", "validation", "fingerprint", "parsing", "language-specific"], "summary_hash": "a4a48c75230e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:28:34+00:00"}
