{"summary": "A dictionary-based transform that injects a random spike (herring) artifact into the k-space of MRI images. It selects a random subset of specified keys, applies a spike with intensity sampled from a user-defined range, and optionally respects per‑channel or global settings. Missing keys are ignored.", "business_intent": "Generate synthetic MRI spike artifacts for data augmentation and robustness testing of deep‑learning models that process MRI data, enabling training of artifact‑detection or correction pipelines.", "keywords": ["MRI", "k-space", "spike artifact", "data augmentation", "MONA", "dictionary transform", "medical imaging", "artifact simulation", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "f2cfbcea86e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:22:43+00:00"}
