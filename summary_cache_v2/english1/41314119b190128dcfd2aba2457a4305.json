{"summary": "The package implements a scalable node‑property prediction pipeline for the OGB‑Product dataset using GraphSAGE. It partitions the graph with METIS, provides a sampler that yields clustered subgraphs with normalization data, and runs a training loop with Adam optimizer, periodic validation and test evaluation, supporting optional multi‑process execution.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate how to efficiently train GraphSAGE on large graphs by leveraging cluster‑based mini‑batch sampling and graph partitioning, showcasing high accuracy on a standard benchmark.", "keywords": ["GraphSAGE", "DGL", "PyTorch", "OGB", "node property prediction", "cluster sampling", "METIS partitioning", "mini-batch training", "graph neural networks"], "summary_hash": "4012a4b4c7ba", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:56:54+00:00"}
