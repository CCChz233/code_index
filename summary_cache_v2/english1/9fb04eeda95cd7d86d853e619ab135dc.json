{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe must not list method names verbatim.

It processes up to num_spks speakers (pairwise inference). It uses hidden size, LSTM layers, dropout, CNN channels, embedding dimension, multiple scales, scale weighting scheme, context vector type (cosine similarity or element-wise product).

It is configurable via parameters such as number of speakers, hidden size, LSTM depth, dropout, CNN channels, embedding dimension, number of scales, weight clamping, and convolution repetitions.\n\nBusiness intent: To serve as a plug‑in module for speech processing pipelines that need accurate, overlap‑aware speaker diarization, especially in applications like meeting transcription, call analytics, or multimedia indexing, by providing a learnable, multi‑scale decoding mechanism that improves over traditional clustering diarizers.\n\nKeywords list.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nMake sure no extra spaces?
