{"summary": "A command‑line utility that orchestrates the training of a duplex text‑normalization system, coordinating the tagger that detects spans requiring normalization and the decoder that converts those spans to spoken or written form. It reads a Hydra configuration, supports separate or joint training of the tagger and decoder, multiple languages, and various modes (TN, ITN, joint).", "business_intent": "Enable developers to build and fine‑tune neural models for converting written text to spoken language (and vice versa) across languages, facilitating deployment of speech‑to‑text and text‑to‑speech pipelines that require accurate text normalization.", "keywords": ["text normalization", "training pipeline", "duplex model", "tagger", "decoder", "speech processing", "language conversion", "TN", "ITN", "NeMo", "Hydra config"], "summary_hash": "ba59e16a428c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:41:52+00:00"}
