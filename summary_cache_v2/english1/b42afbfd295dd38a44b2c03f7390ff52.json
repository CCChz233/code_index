{"summary": "The module implements an example workflow for entity classification on relational graph datasets using a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) built with MXNet and DGL. It prepares data, constructs a multi‑layer RGCN model with L2‑regularized weights, runs a training loop, and evaluates classification accuracy.", "business_intent": "Provide a reference implementation that showcases how to apply relational graph convolutional networks for node (entity) classification tasks, facilitating reproducibility and serving as a template for developers working with heterogeneous graph data.", "keywords": ["relational graph convolutional network", "entity classification", "MXNet", "DGL", "graph neural network", "RDF datasets", "L2 regularization", "training loop", "node classification"], "summary_hash": "e09daa9152c6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:09:47+00:00"}
