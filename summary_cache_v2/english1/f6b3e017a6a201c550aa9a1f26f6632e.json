{"summary": "The module provides neighbor sampling utilities for graph neural network training, constructing multi‑layer message‑passing subgraphs. It includes a sampler that expands all neighbors at each layer for full‑neighbor aggregation and a generic neighbor sampler supporting configurable sampling strategies.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable and efficient mini‑batch training of GNN models by dynamically generating per‑layer subgraphs, reducing memory consumption and simplifying data loading pipelines.", "keywords": ["neighbor sampling", "graph neural network", "mini-batch", "subgraph construction", "message passing", "full neighbor", "multi‑layer", "DGL", "data loader", "block sampler"], "summary_hash": "8e6c0c441f36", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:36:09+00:00"}
