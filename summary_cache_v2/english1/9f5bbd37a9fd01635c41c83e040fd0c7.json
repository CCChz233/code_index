{"summary": "The topsystem preparation package supplies utilities for computing and distributing hydraulic conductance and resistance values across a top‑layer groundwater model grid. It includes methods to calculate conductance for different boundary types, apply various weighting schemes (e.g., based on conductivity, transmissivity, layer thickness, or equal share), and derive leakage, radial, and combined resistance components using NumPy arrays.", "business_intent": "Enable hydrogeologists and model developers to generate accurate hydraulic property inputs for top‑system boundary conditions, streamlining the setup of groundwater simulations and improving flow representation across model layers.", "keywords": ["hydraulic conductance", "hydraulic resistance", "groundwater modeling", "top layer", "grid allocation", "weighting strategies", "leakage resistance", "radial resistance", "numpy", "model preparation"], "summary_hash": "bb29a99b17c4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:06:08+00:00"}
