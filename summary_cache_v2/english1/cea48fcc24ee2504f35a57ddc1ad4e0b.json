{"summary": "The module defines a class that interfaces with the sim_telarray light‑emission package to configure, launch, and manage simulations of artificial calibration light sources for a telescope system. It gathers model parameters, generates the necessary configuration files and command scripts, computes pointing vectors and source‑telescope distances, runs the simulation via a SimtelRunner, and organizes the output with appropriate labeling.", "business_intent": "Enable automated, reproducible calibration simulations for telescope arrays, supporting performance verification, calibration procedure testing, and synthetic data generation for analysis pipelines.", "keywords": ["simulation", "light emission", "calibration", "telescope array", "sim_telarray", "configuration generation", "pointing vector calculation", "distance computation", "output labeling", "SimtelRunner", "astropy", "numpy", "logging", "io handling"], "summary_hash": "5bf19d204496", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:55:58+00:00"}
