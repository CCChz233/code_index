{"summary": "Implements a diffusion‑based pipeline that transforms a single input image, optionally guided by a textual prompt, into a sequence of video frames. The pipeline encodes the image and text into latent space, runs a 3‑D transformer denoising loop conditioned on the prompt, and decodes the final latents back into a video.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and creators to automatically generate short video clips from static images and descriptive text, supporting use cases such as advertising, storytelling, rapid prototyping, and visual content creation.", "keywords": ["image-to-video", "diffusion", "latent generation", "VAE", "3D transformer", "text conditioning", "video synthesis", "AI content creation", "CogVideoX"], "summary_hash": "b2c05453398e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:25:44+00:00"}
