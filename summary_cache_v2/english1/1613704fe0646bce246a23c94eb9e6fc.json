{"summary": "This module defines a comprehensive set of unit tests for the 4‑bit quantization features provided by the BitsAndBytes integration in the Diffusers library. It includes base fixtures, serialization checks, training validation, low‑rank adaptation wrappers, and extensive quality assessments for both standard and Flux transformer models.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correctness, performance, and compatibility of 4‑bit model compression across various scenarios, ensuring that downstream diffusion applications can reliably use bitsandbytes quantization with proper serialization, training, and inference behavior.", "keywords": ["4-bit quantization", "bitsandbytes", "diffusers", "unit testing", "serialization", "training", "LoRA", "model compression", "GPU", "torch"], "summary_hash": "bc890ebd9c2d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:48:13+00:00"}
