{"summary": "This test module validates the functionality of the ModelPruning callback in PyTorch Lightning. It defines a lightweight test model and helper utilities, then runs a suite of unit tests covering scenarios such as multiple pruning callbacks, permanent pruning across checkpoints, distributed training strategies (DDP, CPU, spawn), lottery‑ticket‑hypothesis style pruning, and misconfiguration handling.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the model pruning feature works correctly and robustly across different training configurations, preventing regressions and ensuring proper integration with checkpointing and distributed strategies.", "keywords": ["ModelPruning", "PyTorch Lightning", "Trainer", "callback", "unit test", "pruning", "distributed data parallel", "DDP", "checkpoint", "misconfiguration", "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis", "torch.nn.utils.prune"], "summary_hash": "f5332cdbbef2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:36:39+00:00"}
