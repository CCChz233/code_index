{"summary": "This module implements utilities for aggregating data defined on grid nodes up to edges or faces. It provides both NumPy‑based and Dask‑based pathways, handling partitioned grid connectivity to compute aggregated values (e.g., averages, sums) across higher‑dimensional elements.", "business_intent": "Facilitate efficient computation of derived mesh quantities by transforming node‑centered datasets into edge‑ or face‑centered representations, supporting scalable parallel execution for large unstructured grid analyses.", "keywords": ["aggregation", "node-to-edge", "node-to-face", "unstructured grid", "dask", "numpy", "partitioned connectivity", "uxarray", "data transformation", "parallel computation"], "summary_hash": "8f49ba48efb7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:28:50+00:00"}
