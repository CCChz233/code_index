{"summary": "The module provides a test case that aims to validate the interaction between the mixed‑precision (AMP) plugin and Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training when using a forked multiprocessing start method on multiple GPUs. It imports the necessary Lightning plugin, multiprocessing utilities, conditional test execution helpers, and PyTorch.", "business_intent": "Confirm that the mixed‑precision functionality operates correctly in a forked DDP environment across GPUs, ensuring reliable performance and correctness for users of the Lightning framework in distributed training scenarios.", "keywords": ["PyTorch Lightning", "Distributed Data Parallel", "mixed precision", "AMP", "fork", "GPU", "testing", "plugin", "RunIf", "multiprocessing"], "summary_hash": "8a0a3de14dbb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:41:14+00:00"}
