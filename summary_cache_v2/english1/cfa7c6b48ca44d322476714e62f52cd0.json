{"summary": "The module provides dictionary-based wrappers for various cropping and padding operations, enabling these transforms to be applied directly to entries within a data dictionary. It includes both deterministic and random variants, supports lazy execution, and handles edge cases such as out‑of‑bounds regions and variable image sizes.", "business_intent": "Facilitates preprocessing pipelines for medical imaging and other spatial data by allowing flexible, dictionary‑compatible cropping and padding, which simplifies data augmentation, ensures consistent spatial dimensions, and supports efficient lazy computation.", "keywords": ["dictionary transform", "crop", "pad", "lazy execution", "medical imaging", "data augmentation", "spatial preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "5b73b9611511", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:23:29+00:00"}
