{"summary": "Implements an asynchronous connector that establishes and manages connections to a Windows named pipe using the asyncio Proactor event loop. It handles creation of pipe connections, optional keep‑alive timeout, forced reconnection after each request, and enforces global and per‑host limits on concurrent connections.", "business_intent": "Enable applications to communicate with services exposed via Windows named pipes in an efficient, non‑blocking manner, supporting high concurrency, automatic reconnection, and configurable timeout behavior.", "keywords": ["named pipe", "asyncio", "proactor event loop", "Windows", "asynchronous connector", "keep‑alive", "forced reconnection", "connection limits", "concurrency", "event loop"], "summary_hash": "7c493b5ae5c9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:00:44+00:00"}
