{"summary": "The script transforms an existing audio‑text manifest into a tarred, sharded dataset optimized for NeMo automatic speech recognition pipelines. It builds tar archives, optionally groups samples into duration‑based buckets, shuffles and sorts data within shards, generates metadata and optional DALI index files, and can also merge additional manifests into a pre‑existing tarred collection.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient preparation of large‑scale speech recognition corpora in a tar‑based format that speeds up data loading and training, while supporting advanced features such as bucketing, sorting, shuffling, metadata management, and DALI/WebDataset acceleration.", "keywords": ["audio dataset", "tar archive", "sharding", "manifest processing", "speech recognition", "bucketing", "sorting", "shuffling", "metadata generation", "DALI integration", "WebDataset", "parallel processing"], "summary_hash": "f184f67c177c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:43:37+00:00"}
