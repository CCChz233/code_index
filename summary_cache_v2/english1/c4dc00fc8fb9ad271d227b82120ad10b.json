{"summary": "Implements a post‑processing step for object detection that filters and ranks predicted bounding boxes. It discards boxes below a score threshold, retains a limited number of top‑scoring candidates per feature level, applies non‑maximum suppression across the image, and finally selects the highest‑scoring detections per image.", "business_intent": "Provides a configurable box filtering component to refine detection outputs for downstream computer‑vision tasks such as evaluation, visualization, or further analysis.", "keywords": ["box selection", "score threshold", "top‑k per level", "non‑maximum suppression", "detections per image", "sigmoid activation", "classification logits", "object detection post‑processing", "bounding box filtering"], "summary_hash": "31835bb660fb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:18:05+00:00"}
