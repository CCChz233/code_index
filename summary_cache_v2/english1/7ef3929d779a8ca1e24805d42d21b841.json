{"summary": "Defines a Qiskit gate class that implements uniformly controlled rotations about a chosen Pauli axis (X, Y, or Z). The gate applies a specific rotation angle conditioned on the binary state of a set of control qubits, extending the generic uniformly controlled gate infrastructure.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum algorithm developers to incorporate efficient, parameterized conditional Pauli rotations into circuits, facilitating the construction of advanced quantum operations and simplifying circuit design within the Qiskit framework.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "uniformly controlled gate", "Pauli rotation", "conditional rotation", "Qiskit", "gate class", "parameterized gate", "control qubits", "X axis", "Y axis", "Z axis"], "summary_hash": "6af6fda1d50d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:14:12+00:00"}
