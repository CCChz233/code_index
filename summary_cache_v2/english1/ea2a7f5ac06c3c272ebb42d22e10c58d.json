{"summary": "Provides high‑level diffusion pipelines that combine the Stable Diffusion 3 model with ControlNet extensions to generate or edit images. The core pipeline handles text tokenization, latent initialization, classifier‑free guidance, and iterative denoising using a scheduler, VAE, and multiple encoders. An additional inpainting pipeline adds preprocessing of input images, masks, and control signals, integrates LoRA scaling, and orchestrates the same denoising loop to produce edited images.", "business_intent": "Empower developers and creators to produce customized visual content from textual descriptions and auxiliary conditioning data, supporting use‑cases such as artistic image generation, guided image synthesis, and precise image inpainting for marketing, design, and entertainment applications.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion 3", "ControlNet", "diffusion pipeline", "text‑to‑image", "image inpainting", "classifier‑free guidance", "latent diffusion", "VAE", "scheduler", "LoRA scaling", "image editing", "AI‑generated art"], "summary_hash": "5cd1eff0e0c1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:41:18+00:00"}
