{"summary": "A command‑line utility that transcribes audio files listed in a NeMo‑style manifest using a specified ASR model and then computes error metrics such as word error rate, character error rate, or punctuation error rate. It can also skip transcription and directly evaluate a manifest that already contains predicted transcriptions, optionally outputting per‑sample scores.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to automatically assess and benchmark the accuracy of speech‑to‑text models on custom datasets, facilitating quality control, model comparison, and reporting of transcription performance.", "keywords": ["ASR", "speech-to-text", "evaluation", "word error rate", "character error rate", "punctuation error rate", "manifest", "transcription", "metrics", "benchmarking", "model validation"], "summary_hash": "f4585addae13", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:35:21+00:00"}
