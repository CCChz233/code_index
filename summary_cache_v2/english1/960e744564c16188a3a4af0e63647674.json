{"summary": "This test module validates the behavior of a file‑based logging sink when compressing rotated log files. It includes utilities for creating compressed data, simulating file rotations, renaming, and exercising various compression formats (gzip, bz2, lzma, zip, tar). The suite checks correct handling of compression during removal or rotation, proper fallback when compression libraries are missing, correct file naming after rotation, thread‑safe compression, and appropriate exception propagation.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the logging infrastructure reliably compresses archived log files across supported formats, manages file rotation and naming correctly, and gracefully handles missing dependencies or runtime errors, thereby preserving log integrity and storage efficiency.", "keywords": ["compression", "log rotation", "file sink", "gzip", "bz2", "lzma", "zipfile", "tarfile", "pytest", "exception handling", "threading", "file renaming", "logging reliability"], "summary_hash": "07fa93d9d9f1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:05:32+00:00"}
