{"summary": "This module defines a set of custom TrainerCallback classes that extend the Hugging Face Trainer to add functionality such as logging model-generated completions to experiment tracking services, displaying live training progress with Rich, synchronizing a target model with a reference model after each step, and computing a win‑rate metric by comparing generated responses against a reference using a pairwise judge. It also includes a helper routine for generating completions from prompts.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to monitor, evaluate, and manage language model fine‑tuning more effectively by providing automated logging, real‑time visual feedback, model version syncing, and quantitative win‑rate assessment during training.", "keywords": ["TrainerCallback", "model generation logging", "Weights & Biases", "Rich progress bar", "model synchronization", "win rate metric", "pairwise judge", "evaluation prompts", "transformers", "accelerate"], "summary_hash": "f0ec4f2cf7b0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:00:14+00:00"}
