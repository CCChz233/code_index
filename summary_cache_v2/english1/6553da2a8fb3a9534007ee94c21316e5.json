{"summary": "A flexible residual neural network module that processes 1‑D, 2‑D or 3‑D tensors, optionally adjusting channel dimensions, applying dropout, incorporating timestep embeddings, and supporting optional up‑sampling or down‑sampling. It can use a full convolution or a 1×1 projection in the skip path and offers gradient checkpointing for memory‑efficient training.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, configurable building block for deep learning architectures—especially diffusion or generative models—allowing developers to tailor channel flow, sampling scale, and memory usage without rewriting core residual logic.", "keywords": ["residual block", "channel adjustment", "dropout", "timestep embedding", "upsampling", "downsampling", "gradient checkpointing", "convolutional skip connection", "multi‑dimensional data", "neural network module"], "summary_hash": "2bfade66ceb5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:57:03+00:00"}
