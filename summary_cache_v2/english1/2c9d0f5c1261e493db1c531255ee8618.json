{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests for the training loop infrastructure of PyTorch Lightning. It defines lightweight helper classes (stateless and stateful iterables, a simple deterministic model, and a range-based dataset) and uses them to verify loop behaviors such as fitting, resetting, saving and restoring dataloaders, hierarchy validation, restart logic across multiple dataloaders, handling of exceptions, validation during gradient accumulation, and proper shutdown of worker processes.", "business_intent": "Validate and guarantee the robustness, correctness, and fault‑tolerance of Lightning's training loops, ensuring that state management, checkpointing, restart capabilities, and data loading mechanisms work reliably in production training pipelines.", "keywords": ["PyTorch Lightning", "training loops", "unit testing", "state restoration", "restart logic", "gradient accumulation", "validation", "data loader", "checkpointing", "exception handling", "worker shutdown"], "summary_hash": "a535cf6831c5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:39:25+00:00"}
