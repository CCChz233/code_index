{"summary": "A neural information retrieval component that independently encodes user queries and candidate passages using two distinct BERT encoders, then derives a relevance score by taking the dot‑product of their [CLS] embeddings. It includes utilities for data loading, forward propagation, and loss calculation, and defines the expected input and output schemas.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑accuracy semantic matching engine for search, question answering, or recommendation systems by ranking documents based on learned query‑passage similarity.", "keywords": ["information retrieval", "dual BERT encoders", "query encoding", "passage encoding", "dot product similarity", "semantic search", "neural ranking", "DPR", "model inference", "loss computation"], "summary_hash": "c231374b01f1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:10:14+00:00"}
