{"summary": "Impacket is a Python library that supplies low‑level, object‑oriented classes for constructing, parsing, and manipulating a wide range of network protocol packets, including Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, SMB (v1‑v3), MSRPC, LDAP, and others, with built‑in support for authentication schemes such as NTLM and Kerberos. It also bundles example utilities that demonstrate how to use these capabilities for security‑oriented tasks.", "business_intent": "Enable developers, security researchers, and penetration testers to programmatically interact with network protocols for testing, analysis, and implementation purposes, accelerating security research and tooling development.", "keywords": ["Python", "network protocols", "packet crafting", "SMB", "MSRPC", "NTLM", "Kerberos", "security tools", "penetration testing", "forensic analysis"], "summary_hash": "95291beb3473", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:23:56+00:00"}
