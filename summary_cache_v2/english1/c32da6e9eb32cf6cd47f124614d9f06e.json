{"summary": "Implements a structured logging framework that emits simulation data as JSON records. It defines a logger class that enforces a fixed column schema per log key, writes a header describing the schema on first use, and then logs only the values for subsequent entries, handling timestamps, unique identifiers, log levels and output management. It also provides a custom warning for mismatched log columns and assorted utility helpers for type conversion, column extraction, and logger configuration.", "business_intent": "Enable consistent, machine‑readable logging of simulation results to simplify data collection, analysis, and reproducibility across runs.", "keywords": ["structured logging", "JSON", "simulation", "schema enforcement", "log header", "timestamp", "unique ID", "log level", "warning", "type conversion", "output file"], "summary_hash": "02bb7bc2492f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:51:41+00:00"}
