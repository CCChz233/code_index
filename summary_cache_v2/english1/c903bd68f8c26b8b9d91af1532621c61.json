{"summary": "The module defines a data structure for context biasing in CTC-based automatic speech recognition. It builds a prefix‑tree graph that incorporates CTC's blank transitions, allowing expected words or phrases to be added and the graph to be visualized or traversed. A supporting state class encapsulates node information within the graph.", "business_intent": "Enhance ASR accuracy for targeted vocabulary by providing a configurable biasing graph that can be integrated with CTC models, enabling better recognition of domain‑specific terms or user‑defined phrases.", "keywords": ["context biasing", "CTC", "automatic speech recognition", "prefix tree", "graph structure", "blank token", "vocabulary extension", "state representation", "ASR optimization"], "summary_hash": "1b93d1cf3491", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:14:27+00:00"}
