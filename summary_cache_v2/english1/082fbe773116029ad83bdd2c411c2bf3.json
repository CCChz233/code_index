{"summary": "Implements a neural message‑passing graph convolution where each edge feature is transformed by a user‑provided function into a weight matrix that modulates the source node’s feature before aggregation. The layer aggregates the transformed neighbor messages (sum, mean, or max), optionally adds a residual connection and bias, and outputs updated node representations for both homogeneous and unidirectional bipartite graphs.", "business_intent": "Enable deep learning models to learn edge‑conditioned transformations and aggregate neighbor information efficiently, supporting applications such as quantum chemistry, molecular property prediction, and general graph‑structured data analysis.", "keywords": ["graph convolution", "neural message passing", "edge‑conditioned weights", "dynamic edge function", "aggregation", "residual connection", "bias", "homogeneous graph", "bipartite graph", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "fc9b81da0096", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:53:15+00:00"}
