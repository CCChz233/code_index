{"summary": "This module provides a set of test helper classes and unit test suites that exercise the tracing system's core features, including management of a C‑based tracer, circular buffer behavior, double‑precision parsing, tracing of function calls with argument and return capture, object lifecycle events, execution timing, and filter configuration for inclusion/exclusion and stack depth limits. It also contains an unused placeholder function.", "business_intent": "Ensure the tracing library works correctly and reliably by supplying comprehensive automated tests and utilities that validate its functionality, performance characteristics, and configurability, thereby preventing regressions and supporting future development.", "keywords": ["tracing", "unit tests", "C tracer", "circular buffer", "double parsing", "function call tracing", "argument capture", "return value logging", "object lifecycle", "execution duration", "filter configuration", "include/exclude rules", "stack depth limit", "test utilities", "viztracer"], "summary_hash": "1908a6e4a1a8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:33:31+00:00"}
