{"summary": "Implements a PyTorch module that converts grayscale image patches into SIFT feature vectors. The descriptor is built by computing gradient histograms over a configurable number of orientation bins and spatial subdivisions, applying optional clipping to limit dominant bins and optionally normalizing with RootSIFT. Internally it creates weighting and pooling kernels to aggregate the histograms and outputs a flattened descriptor for each patch.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use, differentiable SIFT feature extractor that can be integrated into deep learning workflows for tasks such as image matching, object recognition, and visual retrieval.", "keywords": ["SIFT", "RootSIFT", "descriptor", "image patches", "gradient histograms", "orientation bins", "spatial bins", "clipping", "pooling kernel", "weighting kernel", "PyTorch", "feature extraction"], "summary_hash": "ecefad24a9e4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:41:45+00:00"}
