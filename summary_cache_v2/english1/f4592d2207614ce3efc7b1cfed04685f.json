{"summary": "The module defines a class that encapsulates the MODFLOW‑6 evapotranspiration (EVT) package. It manages the spatial‑temporal arrays required to describe surface elevation, maximum flux, extinction depth, proportional parameters, and optional solute concentration. The class integrates with boundary‑condition handling, supports regridding via a dedicated method, validates inputs against predefined schemata, and provides configurable output flags.", "business_intent": "Enable modelers to represent surface water–groundwater exchange through evapotranspiration within MODFLOW‑6 simulations, ensuring correct data handling, validation, and optional solute transport while offering flexible output control.", "keywords": ["evapotranspiration", "MODFLOW-6", "groundwater modeling", "boundary condition", "regridding", "spatial-temporal data", "solute concentration", "validation schemas", "output control"], "summary_hash": "6d5c367f08d0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:49:49+00:00"}
