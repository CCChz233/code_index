{"summary": "Provides an iterator that extracts fixed-size patches from multiple tensor entries stored in a dictionary, yielding both the patch data and its spatial coordinates. It aligns patches across specified keys, supports custom start positions and padding modes, and is intended for use with grid-based patch datasets.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient patch-wise processing of multi-channel or multi-modality medical imaging data organized as dictionaries, facilitating model training and inference on localized regions.", "keywords": ["patch extraction", "dictionary data", "spatial coordinates", "padding", "grid dataset", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "iterator", "multi-key"], "summary_hash": "18698c59a350", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:21:18+00:00"}
