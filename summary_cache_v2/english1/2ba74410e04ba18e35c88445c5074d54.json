{"summary": "Applies a stochastic histogram equalization to 3‑D image tensors, with a configurable probability, optional batch‑wide consistency, and flexible output shape handling. It can merge the operation into an existing transformation matrix and reuse previously sampled parameters for deterministic re‑application.", "business_intent": "Introduce random intensity equalization into 3‑D volumetric data pipelines (such as medical imaging) to increase augmentation diversity and improve model robustness during training.", "keywords": ["random equalization", "3D volume", "data augmentation", "probability", "batch consistency", "transformation matrix", "torch", "differentiable", "keepdim"], "summary_hash": "a6f77c0ddbe1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:56:49+00:00"}
