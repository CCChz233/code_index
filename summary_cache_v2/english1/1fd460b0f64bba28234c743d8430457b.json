{"summary": "The script demonstrates how to model and analyze a 2‑D pressure vessel using ANSYS MAPDL through the PyMAPDL interface. It creates the geometry, applies internal pressure under plane‑strain conditions, runs a finite‑element stress analysis, performs an automated mesh convergence study, and visualizes the resulting stress distribution with Matplotlib.", "business_intent": "Provide engineers and analysts with a ready‑to‑run example that automates finite‑element modeling of pressure vessels, illustrating how to integrate MAPDL with Python for rapid stress evaluation, mesh optimization, and result visualization.", "keywords": ["MAPDL", "PyMAPDL", "pressure vessel", "plane strain", "stress analysis", "mesh convergence", "finite element", "Python", "Matplotlib", "NumPy"], "summary_hash": "b32ff561b443", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:57:38+00:00"}
