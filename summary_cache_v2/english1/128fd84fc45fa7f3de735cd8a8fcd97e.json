{"summary": "Implements a stateful metric that measures the proportion of correct predictions in multi‑class classification by comparing the predicted class (argmax of logits or probabilities) with the true class encoded as one‑hot vectors. It accumulates the number of matches and total samples, optionally applying sample weights, and returns the ratio as categorical accuracy.", "business_intent": "Enable model developers to monitor and report classification performance during training and evaluation, facilitating model selection and optimization within the Keras/TensorFlow workflow.", "keywords": ["categorical accuracy", "classification metric", "one‑hot labels", "logits", "sample weight", "stateful metric", "Keras", "TensorFlow", "model evaluation", "accuracy calculation"], "summary_hash": "de0a1e1f4076", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:46:51+00:00"}
