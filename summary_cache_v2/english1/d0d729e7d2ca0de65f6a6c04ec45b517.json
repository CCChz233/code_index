{"summary": "This module provides a collection of utilities for constructing Arkouda distributed arrays (pdarray). It offers server‑side equivalents of common NumPy/Pandas creation operations—such as generating sequences, constant‑filled arrays, linearly spaced values, and random data—while handling type inference, dtype validation, and communication with the Arkouda server.", "business_intent": "To give users a familiar, high‑level interface for initializing large, distributed datasets on the Arkouda platform, enabling efficient parallel analytics without requiring manual server‑side array management.", "keywords": ["distributed array", "pdarray", "array creation", "sequence generation", "constant initialization", "linear spacing", "random data", "dtype handling", "server communication", "high‑performance analytics"], "summary_hash": "7db799f9012a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:22:07+00:00"}
