{"summary": "The module provides utilities for online speaker clustering, enabling real-time diarization by incrementally grouping speaker embeddings. It maintains a buffer of recent embeddings, computes cosine similarity, dynamically estimates similarity thresholds and speaker counts, and aligns speaker labels using linear sum assignment. Helper functions support embedding merging, index retrieval, and label stitching, leveraging offline clustering utilities for underlying operations.", "business_intent": "To facilitate real-time speaker identification and separation in streaming audio applications such as live transcription, meeting analytics, call center monitoring, and interactive voice assistants.", "keywords": ["online speaker clustering", "real-time diarization", "speaker embeddings", "cosine similarity", "dynamic threshold estimation", "speaker count estimation", "embedding buffer management", "linear sum assignment", "offline clustering utilities", "streaming audio processing"], "summary_hash": "ca4c8968dba5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:06:25+00:00"}
