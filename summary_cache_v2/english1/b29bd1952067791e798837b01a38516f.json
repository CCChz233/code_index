{"summary": "A configuration container that holds all hyperparameters and architectural settings required to build a Funnel Transformer or TFBert model, such as vocabulary size, block dimensions, hidden sizes, attention heads, dropout rates, pooling strategies, and initialization details. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and supplies these values to the model constructor.", "business_intent": "Provides a flexible, reproducible way for developers and researchers to specify and modify the structure of Funnel Transformer models, enabling easy model instantiation, fine‑tuning, and deployment across different environments.", "keywords": ["configuration", "funnel transformer", "hyperparameters", "model architecture", "vocab size", "block sizes", "attention heads", "dropout", "layer normalization", "pooling", "initializer", "pretrained config"], "summary_hash": "4d8c158e2d53", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:59:23+00:00"}
