{"summary": "This module provides a suite of unit tests that verify the correctness of table attribute data models and the table‑writing utility used in the fractal‑tasks core library. The tests cover schema validation for feature and masking ROI tables, handling of version mismatches, and proper error raising for invalid inputs and overwrite protection.", "business_intent": "To ensure reliable storage and versioning of analytical tables by automatically detecting schema violations and misuse of the write operation, thereby maintaining data integrity in downstream fractal workflows.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "table attribute validation", "feature table schema", "masking ROI schema", "write table function", "zarr storage", "anndata integration", "error handling", "version control", "data integrity"], "summary_hash": "b1f52a3a7f6e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:55:53+00:00"}
