{"summary": "The module implements a GLM‑based language model used as a text encoder for the Kolors diffusion pipeline. It provides a configuration object, the core model class, and all supporting components such as transformer blocks, attention layers, rotary positional embeddings, RMSNorm, prefix encoding, and embedding extraction, together with utilities for weight initialization and model loading.", "business_intent": "Supply a ready‑to‑use text‑encoding backbone that converts input prompts into dense representations for conditioning image generation models, enabling efficient inference and fine‑tuning of the ChatGLM architecture within the diffusion workflow.", "keywords": ["text encoder", "GLM", "transformer", "attention", "rotary embedding", "RMSNorm", "prefix encoder", "embedding", "PyTorch", "diffusion pipeline", "configuration", "model initialization"], "summary_hash": "c128fc384983", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:22:52+00:00"}
