{"summary": "This module translates quantum circuit gates into pulse schedules while preserving the relative timing of operations. It offers utilities for obtaining measurement schedules and includes a gate‑lowering routine, though the latter is presently unused.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the conversion of high‑level quantum circuit descriptions into low‑level pulse schedules suitable for execution on quantum hardware, supporting backend integration and schedule configuration without managing absolute timing.", "keywords": ["gate lowering", "pulse schedule", "quantum circuit translation", "relative timing", "measurement schedule", "Qiskit", "backend integration", "schedule configuration", "pulse channels", "duration conversion"], "summary_hash": "661c0fd7079f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:03:28+00:00"}
