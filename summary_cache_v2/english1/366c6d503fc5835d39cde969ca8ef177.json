{"summary": "Implements the encoder part of a CLVP model as a stack of self‑attention layers defined by the configuration. It holds the token embedding matrix, constructs the specified number of encoder layers, and offers a forward routine that maps input token IDs through the embeddings and the stacked layers to generate contextual hidden states.", "business_intent": "Supply a modular transformer encoder that converts raw token sequences into rich contextual representations for use in contrastive language‑video pre‑training or related multimodal applications.", "keywords": ["transformer encoder", "self‑attention", "layer stack", "input embeddings", "forward pass", "configuration", "contextual representations", "multimodal"], "summary_hash": "079685ed843d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:01:57+00:00"}
