{"summary": "This module provides a comprehensive test suite for Dask array's blockwise and atop operations. It defines helper functions and a variety of test cases that exercise blockwise graph construction, optimization passes, token handling, axis manipulation, and integration with NumPy and other Dask collections, ensuring that the high‑level graph machinery behaves correctly under diverse scenarios.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correctness, performance, and scalability of Dask's blockwise array computations, which are critical for large‑scale data analytics and scientific computing workloads.", "keywords": ["Dask", "array", "blockwise", "atop", "high-level graph", "optimization", "testing", "parallel computation", "NumPy integration", "data analytics"], "summary_hash": "9b1181f6790f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:23:35+00:00"}
