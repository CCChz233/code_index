{"summary": "The module defines an abstract audio clip class that produces sound samples on demand, tracks duration, sample rate and channel count, and supplies methods for previewing, iterating over sample blocks, measuring peak volume, converting to NumPy arrays, and writing to audio files. It also provides concrete subclasses for clips based on NumPy arrays, audio files, and for combining multiple clips with relative start times, handling overall duration automatically. A helper utility is included to join several audio clips sequentially.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible creation, manipulation, preview, and export of audio segments, as well as composition of multiple audio sources, within a video editing framework.", "keywords": ["audio generation", "sample rate", "numpy array", "audio composition", "preview playback", "audio export", "duration handling", "channel management", "audio concatenation"], "summary_hash": "fb1da627a8b9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:21:04+00:00"}
