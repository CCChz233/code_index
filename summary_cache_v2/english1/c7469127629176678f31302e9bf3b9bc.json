{"summary": "This module supplies a collection of utilities and classes that bridge Metaflow workflows with Apache Airflow. It offers helpers for generating consistent task and run identifiers, encapsulates DAG argument parsing and serialization, defines Airflow task representations with support for Kubernetes pod operators and XCom handling, validates Airflow and Kubernetes provider version compatibility, and models a workflow as a JSON‑serializable structure. The module also includes a custom operator subclass to enable dynamic task mapping of Metaflow artifacts.", "business_intent": "Enable Metaflow pipelines to be expressed, scheduled, and run as Airflow DAGs—particularly on Kubernetes—by abstracting Airflow-specific configuration, ensuring version compatibility, and providing serialization mechanisms for tasks, DAG arguments, and workflow metadata.", "keywords": ["airflow", "metaflow", "kubernetes", "dag", "task", "operator", "xcom", "serialization", "version compatibility", "dynamic mapping", "workflow", "macros", "sensor"], "summary_hash": "f364aef5540b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:10:17+00:00"}
