{"summary": "The module implements a collection of GPU‑accelerated array constructors that mirror NumPy’s creation functions. It covers basic array allocation, conversion from Python objects or files, generation of special matrices, and construction of numerical sequences and coordinate grids, handling dtype, shape, order, strides and memory layout for CuPy ndarrays.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with high‑performance, NumPy‑compatible tools for creating and initializing data on GPUs, facilitating scientific, engineering, and machine‑learning workloads that require fast array setup and manipulation.", "keywords": ["CuPy", "GPU arrays", "array creation", "memory allocation", "data conversion", "special matrices", "meshgrid", "range generation", "NumPy compatibility", "high‑performance computing"], "summary_hash": "982737d690ef", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:34:03+00:00"}
