{"summary": "This module provides sampling strategy utilities for quantum pulse definitions, offering simple helpers to generate left‑aligned, midpoint, and right‑aligned sample points over a specified duration. These strategies are used by sampler functions to discretize continuous pulse functions into NumPy arrays for execution on quantum hardware.", "business_intent": "Enable precise discretization of continuous pulse shapes in quantum control software, facilitating accurate waveform generation for quantum experiments.", "keywords": ["sampling", "pulse", "quantum control", "Qiskit", "discretization", "numpy", "left-aligned sampling", "midpoint sampling", "right-aligned sampling"], "summary_hash": "5e75447f5ac4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:05:25+00:00"}
