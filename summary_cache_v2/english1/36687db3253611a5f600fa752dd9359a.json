{"summary": "This module supplies GPU‑accelerated implementations of a wide range of multidimensional image filtering operations for CuPy arrays, mirroring the functionality of SciPy's ndimage filters. It includes high‑level helpers for convolution, correlation, Gaussian smoothing, derivative, Laplacian, Sobel/Prewitt edge detection, rank‑based filters, and uniform/median filtering, built on low‑level CUDA kernels.", "business_intent": "Provide fast, scalable image processing capabilities on NVIDIA GPUs for scientific, medical, and computer‑vision applications, allowing users to replace CPU‑bound SciPy ndimage filters with CuPy‑based equivalents without changing their code.", "keywords": ["GPU", "CuPy", "image filtering", "convolution", "correlation", "Gaussian filter", "Sobel", "Prewitt", "Laplacian", "median filter", "uniform filter", "rank filter", "scientific computing"], "summary_hash": "1b9ece812780", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:33:03+00:00"}
