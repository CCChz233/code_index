{"summary": "Provides a PyTorch module that implements the EdgeConv operation from Dynamic Graph CNN, computing edge messages as a linear transformation of the difference between neighbor and central node features combined with a linear transformation of the central node, aggregating messages via max pooling, and supporting optional batch normalization and zero‑in‑degree handling.", "business_intent": "Facilitates the construction of graph neural network models that require expressive edge‑wise feature updates, enabling developers to incorporate dynamic graph convolutional layers for tasks such as point‑cloud processing, shape analysis, and other graph‑structured data applications.", "keywords": ["EdgeConv", "graph neural network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "message passing", "max aggregation", "batch normalization", "zero in-degree handling", "dynamic graph CNN"], "summary_hash": "96f1bae3c2e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:46:24+00:00"}
