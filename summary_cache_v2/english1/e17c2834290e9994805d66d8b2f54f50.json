{"summary": "The module defines an evaluator that measures the classification accuracy of CrossEncoder models producing multiple softmax outputs. It compares model predictions against gold labels, aggregates results, and can log them for analysis.", "business_intent": "To provide a reliable way to validate and benchmark the performance of NLP classification models, supporting model selection, tuning, and quality assurance in production pipelines.", "keywords": ["cross-encoder", "softmax", "accuracy evaluation", "classification", "NLP", "model benchmarking", "sentence-transformers", "performance metrics"], "summary_hash": "e1a292779045", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:56:28+00:00"}
