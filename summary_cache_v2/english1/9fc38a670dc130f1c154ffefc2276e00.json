{"summary": "The module provides a standalone example that runs distributed speech synthesis using a pretrained VITS model. It loads a text dataset, preprocesses the inputs, creates a data loader, performs parallel inference across multiple devices with Accelerate, and writes the generated audio waveforms to disk.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate scalable, high‑throughput text‑to‑speech generation for use cases such as voice assistants, content creation, or large‑scale audio dataset production.", "keywords": ["speech synthesis", "VITS", "distributed inference", "accelerate", "data loader", "preprocessing", "audio generation", "torch", "transformers", "wav output"], "summary_hash": "3ded70f8788f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:17:23+00:00"}
