{"summary": "A placeholder learning‑rate scheduler that wraps an optimizer and exposes standard scheduler interfaces (total steps, warmup, callable creation) without performing real scheduling. It exists mainly to satisfy configuration expectations and keep the training loop compatible with conventional scheduler usage in DeepSpeed setups.", "business_intent": "Provide compatibility with training pipelines that require a scheduler object, enabling seamless integration of DeepSpeed scheduler configurations while leaving the optimizer’s learning rate unchanged.", "keywords": ["dummy", "scheduler", "learning rate", "optimizer wrapper", "warmup", "total steps", "placeholder", "compatibility", "training loop", "DeepSpeed"], "summary_hash": "ef94d882830a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:10:45+00:00"}
