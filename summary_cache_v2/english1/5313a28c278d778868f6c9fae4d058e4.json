{"summary": "The module implements a high‑performance inference pipeline for the Stable Diffusion XL text‑to‑image model using TensorRT. It orchestrates loading of TensorRT engines, GPU memory budgeting, tokenisation of textual prompts, execution of the diffusion denoising loop, and decoding of latent tensors into final images.", "business_intent": "Provide a fast, scalable solution for generating images from text prompts, targeting applications such as creative content generation, design assistance, and AI‑driven visual media where low latency and efficient GPU utilization are critical.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion XL", "TensorRT", "text‑to‑image", "GPU acceleration", "diffusion inference", "prompt tokenisation", "denoising", "image synthesis", "high performance AI"], "summary_hash": "861f8f284a31", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:38:18+00:00"}
