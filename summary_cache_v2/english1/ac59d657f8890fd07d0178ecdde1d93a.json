{"summary": "This module provides utilities for handling experimental or prototype features within Prefect. It defines custom exception and warning types, a feature wrapper that respects global and per‑group configuration flags, and decorators that mark functions as experimental. Helper functions check whether a feature is enabled, emit configurable warnings, and enforce opt‑in requirements based on Prefect settings.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to safely expose experimental functionality by issuing configurable warnings and requiring explicit opt‑in, allowing controlled rollout and visibility of prototype code through Prefect's settings system.", "keywords": ["experimental", "warning", "opt-in", "feature flag", "decorator", "configuration", "Prefect settings", "exception", "prototype"], "summary_hash": "04e491423a0d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:33:36+00:00"}
