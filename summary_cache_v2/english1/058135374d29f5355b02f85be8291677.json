{"summary": "IQXSimple creates a concise visual stylesheet for quantum pulse schedules, rendering stepwise waveform envelopes labeled with LaTeX pulse names and applying phase modulation, while omitting low‑level channel annotations such as frame changes, snapshots, barriers, and acquire operations. The output includes the chart title and orders channels by qubit index.", "business_intent": "Provide a streamlined, publication‑ready visualization of pulse sequences that highlights the essential waveform shapes and phase information without clutter from detailed channel metadata.", "keywords": ["pulse visualization", "waveform envelope", "phase modulation", "LaTeX labeling", "chart title", "qubit sorting", "quantum schedule", "simplified stylesheet"], "summary_hash": "a96b13966e60", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:17:38+00:00"}
