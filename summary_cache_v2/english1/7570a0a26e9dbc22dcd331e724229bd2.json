{"summary": "The module defines a set of classes that encapsulate hydraulic property fields—horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, vertical anisotropy, and vertical resistance—for aquifer and aquitard layers. Each class stores the property as a spatially indexed xarray DataArray, applies validation rules (e.g., non‑negative values, minimum resistance), and performs conversions required by MODFLOW/iMODFLOW conventions.", "business_intent": "To supply validated, consistently formatted hydraulic parameter objects that can be directly integrated into groundwater flow models, facilitating accurate simulation of flow dynamics and ensuring compatibility with iMODFLOW and MODFLOW data specifications.", "keywords": ["hydraulic conductivity", "transmissivity", "vertical anisotropy", "vertical resistance", "aquifer layers", "groundwater flow modeling", "MODFLOW", "iMODFLOW", "spatial data", "xarray", "data validation", "parameter scaling"], "summary_hash": "4d75566738c5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:42:22+00:00"}
