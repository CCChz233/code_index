{"summary": "Provides a Lightning callback that automatically gathers hardware resource statistics—CPU usage and optional GPU utilization—during training, validation, and testing phases and records them via the trainer's logger. Includes a utility to prepend a prefix to metric keys.", "business_intent": "Give users visibility into system resource consumption while training models, helping detect performance bottlenecks, optimize hardware usage, and support debugging and monitoring through logged metrics.", "keywords": ["hardware monitoring", "CPU usage", "GPU usage", "training callback", "resource utilization", "metric logging", "PyTorch Lightning", "performance analysis", "system stats", "debugging"], "summary_hash": "f42edd39fda1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:54:56+00:00"}
