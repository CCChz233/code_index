{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests that validate the behavior of batched heterogeneous graph operations in the Deep Graph Library (DGL). The tests cover aspects such as preserving empty data, handling node and edge types, maintaining topology and features during batching and unbatching, and correctly slicing batched graphs.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and correctness of DGL's batched heterogeneous graph functionality, which is critical for scalable graph neural network training and inference across multiple node and edge types.", "keywords": ["DGL", "heterogeneous graph", "batching", "unbatching", "graph topology", "node features", "edge features", "unit testing", "graph neural networks"], "summary_hash": "9852782e124e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:05:18+00:00"}
