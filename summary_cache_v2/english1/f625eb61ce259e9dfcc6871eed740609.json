{"summary": "The module provides automated test suites for the Stable Diffusion 2 pipeline, including fast unit tests with lightweight dummy components and more extensive nightly/slow tests with full model execution. It verifies core functionality such as scheduler compatibility, attention slicing, batch versus single inference consistency, handling of long prompts, and proper resource cleanup.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and correctness of the Stable Diffusion 2 pipeline across different configurations and hardware setups, preventing regressions and maintaining quality for production releases.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion 2", "pipeline testing", "unit tests", "integration tests", "scheduler compatibility", "attention slicing", "batch inference", "long prompt handling", "deterministic output", "diffusers", "torch"], "summary_hash": "e585f32f91a3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:51:05+00:00"}
