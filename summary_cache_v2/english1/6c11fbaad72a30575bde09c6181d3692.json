Additionally, it includes helper utilities for interpreting sort specifications and retrieving identifiers of all resources stored in the datastore.", "business_intent": "To allow CKAN extensions to plug in different storage engines for the datastore while presenting a uniform API for data manipulation and query, facilitating flexible backend configuration and consistent resource handling across the platform.", "keywords": ["CKAN", "datastore", "backend", "abstract base class", "plugin registration", "CRUD operations", "search", "upsert", "utility functions", "resource identifiers"], "summary_hash": "84ff42b2fb05", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T19:22:31+00:00"}
