{"summary": "This module provides data‑class structures that encapsulate the penalty weight parameters employed by Primer3 to score primer and internal probe designs. The classes expose default values aligned with the Primer3 manual and allow users to override individual weights, thereby influencing how deviations in size, melting temperature, GC content, self‑complementarity, and other characteristics affect the overall design score.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and laboratory scientists to fine‑tune PCR assay design by customizing the relative importance of various primer and probe attributes, leading to more targeted and optimal oligonucleotide selection for molecular diagnostics and research applications.", "keywords": ["Primer3", "penalty weights", "primer design", "probe design", "PCR assay", "customizable scoring", "melting temperature", "GC content", "self‑complementarity", "hairpin stability", "data class"], "summary_hash": "bc86ce502877", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:11:38+00:00"}
