{"summary": "Encapsulates a pattern‑replacement rule that matches a left‑hand‑side task expression, captures optional variables, and produces a right‑hand‑side result which may be a static task or a callable that computes the replacement from the captured values. Stores the pattern, replacement, and variable list and provides standard representations and an internal helper to apply the rule to matching subjects.", "business_intent": "Facilitate automated transformation and simplification of task graphs or symbolic expressions by defining reusable rewrite rules that can be applied during optimization or code generation phases.", "keywords": ["rewrite", "pattern matching", "task transformation", "lhs", "rhs", "variables", "callable replacement", "rule engine", "expression simplification", "substitution"], "summary_hash": "cf855ba51508", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:07:22+00:00"}
