They simulate different behaviours such as basic file operations, cached file handling with hash‑based URLs, extra regex pattern substitutions for CSS url() rewriting, a remote storage that always appears newer to prevent copying, a stub storage with unimplemented path resolution, and a utility for managing query‑string parameters.", "business_intent": "Provide configurable storage implementations that enable comprehensive testing of Django’s staticfiles collection, caching, URL rewriting, and remote handling logic without relying on real file systems or external services.", "keywords": ["Django", "staticfiles", "storage", "testing", "mock", "cache", "hash", "regex", "URL rewriting", "query string", "remote storage"], "summary_hash": "948f7c832089", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:53:31+00:00"}
