{"summary": "This module implements a callback system for Dask computations. It defines a base class that users can subclass to attach custom actions to various stages of a Dask task's lifecycle, and provides a context manager that temporarily registers a set of such callbacks for the duration of a code block, restoring the previous configuration afterwards. Helper utilities are included for handling and normalizing callback specifications.", "business_intent": "Enable extensible monitoring, logging, profiling, or other side‑effects during Dask execution by allowing developers to plug in custom functions that react to computation events without modifying core Dask code.", "keywords": ["callbacks", "Dask", "context manager", "hook", "monitoring", "logging", "profiling", "task lifecycle", "extensibility", "execution stages"], "summary_hash": "42887392c514", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:16:38+00:00"}
