{"summary": "A neural network module that applies a configurable 1×1 convolution to transform input feature maps into per‑class probability maps, without a preceding activation layer. It supports arbitrary spatial dimensions, stride, kernel size, and customizable ordering of normalization, dropout, and activation components.", "business_intent": "Provides a ready‑to‑use classification head for segmentation or dense prediction models, enabling downstream tasks such as medical image segmentation, scene parsing, or any application requiring per‑pixel class probabilities.", "keywords": ["1x1 convolution", "classifier head", "probability map", "segmentation", "dense prediction", "neural network module", "activation ordering", "normalization", "dropout"], "summary_hash": "0b5651304b9f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:34:55+00:00"}
