{"summary": "Creates a synthetic node classification dataset by generating a Barabási–Albert graph, attaching house‑shaped motifs, adding random edge perturbations, assigning four class labels (base graph vs. house parts), and providing a constant feature vector for all nodes. Handles dataset generation, optional caching, loading, and optional graph transformations.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use benchmark for training, testing, and explaining graph neural network models, especially for evaluating explanation techniques like GNNExplainer.", "keywords": ["synthetic graph", "node classification", "Barabási–Albert", "house motif", "graph dataset", "GNNExplainer", "perturbation", "caching", "graph transformation", "benchmark"], "summary_hash": "b69ee05edb8a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:44:35+00:00"}
