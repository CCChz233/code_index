{"summary": "Applies a centered, scaled cropping operation to one or more data entries identified by keys, using a common ROI size derived from the original spatial dimensions. The transform works on dictionary inputs, enforces consistent spatial shapes across the selected items, and can operate lazily to defer actual resampling.", "business_intent": "Prepare medical imaging datasets by extracting a centrally located region of interest with a configurable scale, reducing data size while preserving relevant anatomy for downstream analysis or model training.", "keywords": ["center crop", "scaled ROI", "dictionary transform", "lazy execution", "spatial consistency", "medical imaging preprocessing", "key-based operation"], "summary_hash": "e8910a6bb172", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:04:26+00:00"}
