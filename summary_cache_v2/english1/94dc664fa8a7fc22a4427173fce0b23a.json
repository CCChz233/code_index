{"summary": "A unit‑test module that verifies the functionality of the MLflow handler used in MONAI training pipelines. It checks that datasets and metrics are correctly logged, that metric values can be updated iteratively, that multiple independent runs produce separate logs, and that concurrent execution via threads does not corrupt logging.", "business_intent": "Guarantee reliable experiment tracking with MLflow for medical imaging models, ensuring accurate metric and dataset logging across repeated and parallel training sessions.", "keywords": ["MLflow", "handler", "logging", "metrics", "datasets", "concurrency", "unit testing", "MONAI", "Ignite", "training loop", "event filtering"], "summary_hash": "86139c7959bc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:50:28+00:00"}
