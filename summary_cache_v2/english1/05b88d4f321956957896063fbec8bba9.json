{"summary": "The module implements the loss components required for training a VITS text‑to‑speech model. It provides separate loss calculations for the adversarial discriminator, the generator, a feature‑matching term that aligns intermediate discriminator activations, and a Kullback‑Leibler divergence regularizer. Each loss class inherits from the NeMo Loss base class and defines the expected neural type signatures for inputs and outputs.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to train high‑fidelity, end‑to‑end TTS systems based on the VITS architecture by supplying the necessary adversarial and regularization loss functions within the NVIDIA NeMo framework.", "keywords": ["VITS", "text-to-speech", "TTS", "adversarial loss", "discriminator", "generator", "feature matching", "KL divergence", "NeMo", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "0152a493973c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:56:40+00:00"}
