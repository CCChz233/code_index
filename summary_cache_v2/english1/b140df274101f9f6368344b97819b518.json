{"summary": "This module implements a set of Terraform static analysis checks targeting OpenStack resources. It includes checks for insecure security‑group ingress rules (e.g., unrestricted traffic on any port, specifically SSH port 22 and RDP port 3389), validates that firewall rule sets specify destination IP addresses, and ensures that OpenStack compute instances do not use prohibited administrator passwords. An abstract base class provides common logic for detecting unrestricted ingress, which concrete checks extend.", "business_intent": "Enable organizations to automatically detect and remediate insecure OpenStack configurations in their Terraform code, thereby improving cloud security posture and compliance with best‑practice policies.", "keywords": ["OpenStack", "Terraform", "security checks", "static analysis", "IaC", "security groups", "firewall rules", "admin password", "unrestricted ingress", "SSH", "RDP", "compliance"], "summary_hash": "6aedc160e6e4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:20:43+00:00"}
