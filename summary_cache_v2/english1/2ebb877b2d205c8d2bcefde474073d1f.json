{"summary": "The module defines a Tree class that models a hierarchical collection of data objects, offering list‑style access, iteration, slicing, and utilities for traversal, serialization, and caching. It also provides a TreeModifier utility for list‑like manipulation of a tree's internal cache, supporting addition, removal, name‑based indexing, and automatic sorting to keep the cache in a serializable state.", "business_intent": "To represent and manage hierarchical data structures in a version‑control‑like system, enabling efficient access, modification, and reliable serialization of tree objects and their caches.", "keywords": ["Tree", "hierarchical collection", "list‑style access", "iteration", "slicing", "traversal", "serialization", "caching", "cache manipulation", "addition", "removal", "indexing", "sorting", "utility"], "summary_hash": "961240ff941d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:46:56+00:00"}
