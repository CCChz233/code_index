{"summary": "The module provides a suite of unit tests that verify the behavior of a random low‑resolution simulation transform used in medical image preprocessing. It checks the transform across various array types, parameter configurations, and ensures output consistency with reference implementations using parameterized test cases.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and stability of the low‑resolution simulation step in the data augmentation pipeline, thereby supporting reliable model training and evaluation in clinical imaging applications.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "low resolution simulation", "random transform", "medical imaging", "MONAI", "parameterized tests", "numpy arrays", "assertion utilities"], "summary_hash": "1b8658dfe2b0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:57:12+00:00"}
