It specifies model dimensions, positional encoding settings, layer‑norm placement (pre or post), and whether the block should be reversible.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to define and reuse consistent Transformer block specifications across different parts of a model, simplifying architecture setup and ensuring uniformity in hyper‑parameter configuration.", "keywords": ["transformer", "block configuration", "encoder", "decoder", "dimensions", "positional encoding", "layer normalization", "reversibility", "neural network", "architecture", "config"], "summary_hash": "2ac75e7e5110", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:15:02+00:00"}
