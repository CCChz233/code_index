{"summary": "The module implements a WordEmbeddings class that encapsulates the lifecycle of static word‑embedding resources. It supports loading and persisting embeddings (including safetensor format), tokenizing input strings, exposing model configuration and vector size, and producing embedding vectors through a forward pass compatible with PyTorch pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable applications to integrate pre‑trained word‑embedding models quickly, allowing developers to retrieve, store, and compute dense word representations for downstream natural‑language processing tasks such as similarity search, classification, or semantic indexing.", "keywords": ["word embeddings", "tokenization", "load", "save", "configuration", "dimensionality", "forward pass", "PyTorch", "safetensors", "sentence-transformers"], "summary_hash": "b121f6142099", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:54:22+00:00"}
