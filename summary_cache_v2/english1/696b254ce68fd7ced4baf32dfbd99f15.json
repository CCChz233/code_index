{"summary": "Implements a configurable convolutional subsampling layer for speech models, supporting VGG‑style, stride‑based, and depthwise‑stride approaches. It reduces temporal resolution by a power‑of‑two factor, optionally chunks inputs, and can split convolutions across batches or channels for efficient streaming. The class exposes forward computation, parameter initialization, and getters for the resulting frame rate and required cache size.", "business_intent": "Accelerate transformer‑based speech recognition by shrinking input sequences and enabling low‑latency, streaming inference through optimized convolutional down‑sampling.", "keywords": ["convolutional subsampling", "VGGNet", "striding", "depthwise striding", "speech recognition", "transformer", "feature reduction", "chunking", "streaming inference", "channel splitting", "activation"], "summary_hash": "feb3801fdf34", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:31:52+00:00"}
