{"summary": "The module implements a Categorical data structure for Arkouda, representing a one‑dimensional array of string values as integer codes linked to a distinct set of category labels. It provides methods for efficient lookup, grouping, sorting, and memory‑optimized storage of categorical data using Arkouda's distributed arrays.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑performance, scalable data analysis on large datasets by offering a memory‑efficient categorical type that supports fast grouping, aggregation, and sorting operations within the Arkouda framework.", "keywords": ["categorical", "integer encoding", "category labels", "memory optimization", "groupby", "sorting", "Arkoud a", "distributed arrays", "string handling", "data analytics"], "summary_hash": "84ceca242790", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:22:50+00:00"}
