{"summary": "A configuration container for the UnivNet vocoder model that holds all architectural hyper‑parameters such as input and hidden channel counts, mel‑spectrogram dimensions, residual block kernel/stride/dilation patterns, kernel‑predictor network settings, weight initializer range and activation slope. It inherits from PretrainedConfig and is used to instantiate a UnivNetModel with a defined architecture.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to easily customize and reproduce UnivNet vocoder architectures for speech synthesis or voice conversion tasks, ensuring compatibility with the corresponding feature extractor and providing sensible defaults that match reference implementations.", "keywords": ["configuration", "UnivNet", "vocoder", "model architecture", "residual network", "kernel predictor", "mel spectrogram", "hyperparameters", "PretrainedConfig", "speech synthesis"], "summary_hash": "d6a435dfe57e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:30:47+00:00"}
