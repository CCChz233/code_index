{"summary": "Encapsulates every configurable aspect of a model training loop, from output handling, data loading, batch sizes and gradient accumulation to optimizer settings, learning‑rate scheduling, evaluation and logging strategies, checkpointing policies, hardware selection, mixed‑precision, distributed training options, reproducibility seeds and integration with external services such as the Hub. The class can be built from command‑line arguments via HfArgumentParser and provides convenient properties that compute derived values like effective batch sizes or device placement.", "business_intent": "Provide a single, user‑friendly configuration object that lets developers and training scripts flexibly control and reproduce the entire training process for transformer models across diverse environments and hardware setups.", "keywords": ["training configuration", "hyperparameters", "evaluation strategy", "logging", "checkpointing", "distributed training", "mixed precision", "device management", "argument parsing", "reproducibility", "optimizer", "learning rate scheduler", "hub integration"], "summary_hash": "f530abee866d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:19:40+00:00"}
