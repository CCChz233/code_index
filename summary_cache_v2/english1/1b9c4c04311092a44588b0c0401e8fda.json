{"summary": "This module implements a diffusion‑based image‑to‑image pipeline that encodes an input image into latent space, combines it with text embeddings from CLIP and T5 models, and iteratively denoises the latents using a conditional transformer and a scheduler to generate edited or inpainted images. It manages VAE encoding/decoding, latent packing, prompt embedding, timestep scheduling, and guidance scaling, and includes auxiliary utilities for latent and timestep manipulation.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use API for developers to perform image editing, style transfer, or inpainting by supplying an image and textual prompts, leveraging the Flux diffusion model within the Diffusers ecosystem.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "image-to-image", "latent encoding", "VAE", "transformer", "scheduler", "CLIP", "T5", "guidance scaling", "LoRA", "torch", "pipeline"], "summary_hash": "4ad461c00a86", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:19:27+00:00"}
