{"summary": "The module provides a low‑rank matrix abstraction that stores a matrix as the product of two smaller factor matrices. It mimics array indexing and arithmetic while delivering fast linear‑algebra operations such as eigenvalue, norm, and singular‑value decomposition calculations without constructing the full dense matrix.", "business_intent": "Enable memory‑efficient and high‑performance linear algebra for large matrices used in transformer model analysis and research, allowing rapid computation of spectral properties and norms without the overhead of full matrix materialization.", "keywords": ["low‑rank factorization", "efficient matrix representation", "fast eigenvalue computation", "singular value decomposition", "matrix norms", "array‑like indexing", "memory optimization", "transformer model analysis", "linear algebra acceleration", "FactoredMatrix"], "summary_hash": "3293635e237b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:21:23+00:00"}
