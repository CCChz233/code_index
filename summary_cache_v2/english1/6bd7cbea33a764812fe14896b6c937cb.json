{"summary": "Implements a hard‑negative sampling mechanism for classification training that selects a fixed number of samples per image, maintaining a configurable positive fraction while picking the most challenging negative instances (those with highest prediction scores) from a larger pool, with a minimum negative count guarantee. Includes utilities to compute and retrieve the selected positives and negatives.", "business_intent": "Enhance classifier performance by lowering false‑positive rates through focused training on difficult negative examples, leading to more robust and accurate models.", "keywords": ["hard negative sampling", "classification training", "false positive reduction", "sample selection", "positive fraction", "negative pool", "machine learning", "model robustness", "training data sampling"], "summary_hash": "c374501673af", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:18:19+00:00"}
