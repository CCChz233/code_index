{"summary": "Implements a transpiler optimization that detects swap gates placed directly before measurement operations and removes them, updating the measurement to target the correct qubit and classical bit. This reduces circuit depth and eliminates redundant operations during compilation.", "business_intent": "Enhance quantum circuit compilation efficiency by pruning unnecessary swaps before measurement, leading to shorter execution times and lower error rates on quantum hardware.", "keywords": ["transpiler", "optimization", "swap gate", "measurement", "circuit rewriting", "DAG", "quantum compilation", "pass", "circuit depth reduction"], "summary_hash": "1f76373bce4d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:25:12+00:00"}
