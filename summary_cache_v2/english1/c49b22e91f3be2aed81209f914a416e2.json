{"summary": "The module implements an inference scenario that prepares inputs, computes operation volumes, executes AI inference workloads on a chosen backend, and records detailed performance metrics—including latency, per‑token latency, throughput, energy efficiency, and memory usage—for tasks such as image diffusion and text generation. It integrates with various trackers and produces benchmark reports.", "business_intent": "Enable systematic benchmarking and comparison of AI inference performance across different hardware backends, helping users evaluate efficiency, speed, and resource consumption of diverse models and workloads.", "keywords": ["inference", "benchmark", "latency", "throughput", "energy efficiency", "memory usage", "operation volume", "backend", "image diffusion", "text generation", "performance tracking", "AI models"], "summary_hash": "b233a4618048", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:31:23+00:00"}
