{"summary": "This module implements a multiscale diarization decoder that leverages NeMo's EncDecDiarLabelModel to process audio inputs, apply hierarchical segmentation, and produce speaker turn predictions. It handles configuration loading, experiment management, seeding, and logging, and provides a command‑line entry point for running the decoder.", "business_intent": "Enable automated speaker diarization for audio and speech analytics applications, such as meeting transcription, call center monitoring, and multimedia indexing, by providing a scalable neural decoding pipeline.", "keywords": ["diarization", "speaker segmentation", "neural network", "multiscale", "decoder", "NVIDIA NeMo", "ASR", "audio processing", "machine learning", "CLI"], "summary_hash": "5291e8fa770c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:36:08+00:00"}
