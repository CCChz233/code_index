{"summary": "The module defines a mock single‑qubit quantum backend that emulates the behavior and calibration data of a real device. It extends a generic fake backend class, specifies the backend name, version, qubit count, supported gates, and detailed properties such as gate durations, error rates, and readout characteristics using Qiskit’s BackendProperties model. This fake backend can be instantiated for unit tests, examples, and development without requiring access to actual quantum hardware.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and testers to run, validate, and benchmark Qiskit circuits on a deterministic 1‑qubit device model, facilitating testing, debugging, and educational use when real quantum processors are unavailable.", "keywords": ["mock backend", "single qubit", "quantum device simulation", "Qiskit testing", "backend properties", "gate errors", "calibration data", "development", "unit testing", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "4f7267a6ea7a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:32:15+00:00"}
