{"summary": "The module implements a percentile‑based calibration utility for quantizing Stable Diffusion models. It gathers activation statistics during a calibration run and computes a threshold value that corresponds to a specified percentile, leveraging the Ammo quantization framework.", "business_intent": "Enable lower‑precision inference for Stable Diffusion pipelines by providing accurate calibration thresholds, reducing memory and compute costs while maintaining visual quality.", "keywords": ["quantization", "calibration", "percentile", "Stable Diffusion", "PyTorch", "Ammo", "activation statistics", "threshold computation", "model optimization"], "summary_hash": "dea68fd808bf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:03:50+00:00"}
