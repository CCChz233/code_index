{"summary": "An example script that demonstrates how to fine‑tune a causal language model with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using the TRL library. It loads a dataset, tokenizes prompts, prepares the data, configures the language model, reward model, and tokenizer, sets up a PPO trainer, and runs the training loop to optimize the model with reinforcement learning signals.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with a ready‑to‑run reference for applying PPO‑based reinforcement learning to language models, facilitating experiments in model alignment, reward‑guided generation, and advanced fine‑tuning workflows.", "keywords": ["PPO", "reinforcement learning", "language model fine-tuning", "TRL", "transformers", "dataset preparation", "tokenization", "reward model", "causal LM", "example script"], "summary_hash": "9f4caf7aba39", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:02:38+00:00"}
