{"summary": "The module runs a word-error-rate benchmark for Whisper speech-to-text models. It loads a specified audio dataset, performs inference with a Faster-Whisper model, normalizes the transcriptions, computes WER using jiwer, and records the results in a JSON report while showing progress with tqdm.", "business_intent": "Provide an automated way to evaluate and compare the accuracy of Whisper-based speech recognition systems on custom datasets, enabling stakeholders to assess model performance and make data-driven decisions about deployment or further development.", "keywords": ["Whisper", "speech recognition", "WER", "benchmark", "inference", "dataset", "faster-whisper", "jiwer", "normalization", "JSON", "tqdm"], "summary_hash": "561f4162f1bb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:18:38+00:00"}
