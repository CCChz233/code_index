{"summary": "The module defines a reusable test mixin that validates user‑provided implementations of Dask’s low‑level `get` scheduler function. It supplies a comprehensive suite of task‑graph fixtures—simple, nested, list‑based, and high‑level graphs—and asserts that the `get` implementation returns correct results, properly handles missing keys, respects recursion limits, and behaves consistently across edge cases. Helper utilities for building and comparing graphs are also included.", "business_intent": "Offer a standardized testing framework that developers can inherit to guarantee that custom `get` functions conform to Dask’s expected scheduling semantics, thereby preventing regressions and ensuring reliable execution of arbitrary task graphs.", "keywords": ["test mixin", "scheduler get verification", "task graph fixtures", "edge case handling", "Dask testing framework"], "summary_hash": "8b2062a843d5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:26:49+00:00"}
