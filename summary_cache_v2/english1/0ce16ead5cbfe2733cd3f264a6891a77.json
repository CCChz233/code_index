{"summary": "A collection of lightweight PyTorch modules that implement core operations for building ResNet‑style deep neural networks, including 2‑D convolutions with specialized initialization, global average pooling, tensor axis permutation, and configurable residual and bottleneck blocks. These components are tailored for multimodal speech and computer‑vision models in the NeMo toolkit.", "business_intent": "Enable rapid development and stable training of high‑performance speech and vision models by providing reusable, well‑initialized building blocks for constructing deep residual architectures within the NeMo multimodal framework.", "keywords": ["convolution", "weight initialization", "ResNet", "residual block", "bottleneck", "global average pooling", "tensor permutation", "multimodal", "speech", "computer vision", "PyTorch", "neural network module"], "summary_hash": "cdc6ddde070d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:02:48+00:00"}
