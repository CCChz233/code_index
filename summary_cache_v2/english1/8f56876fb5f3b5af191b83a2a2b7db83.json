{"summary": "The module supplies ready‑to‑use graph encoder components based on two advanced GNN architectures: a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) tailored for Open Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, and a Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) layer with configurable aggregators and scalers. Both encoders integrate atom/bond feature encoders, multi‑layer perceptrons, and graph‑level pooling, offering flexible building blocks for downstream graph property prediction models.", "business_intent": "Accelerate development of scientific and industrial machine‑learning pipelines that require high‑quality graph representations, such as molecular property prediction in drug discovery, material design, and broader graph analytics tasks.", "keywords": ["GIN", "Graph Isomorphism Network", "PNA", "Principal Neighborhood Aggregation", "graph encoder", "graph neural network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "OGB", "molecular graphs", "atom encoder", "bond encoder", "graph pooling", "representation learning"], "summary_hash": "fdde878db6d2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:48:03+00:00"}
