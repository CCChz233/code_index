{"summary": "The module contains tests that validate the correct propagation of device and dtype settings through nested modules when using Lightning's device/dtype mixin, particularly in multi‑GPU DDP spawn scenarios. It defines a callback to assert tensor placement, reusable submodule and top‑level module classes, and a test that exercises these components with a trainer and a simple model.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that Lightning's device and dtype management works reliably across hierarchical modules and distributed training setups, reducing runtime errors and ensuring consistent hardware utilization for production‑grade deep learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["device", "dtype", "mixin", "PyTorch Lightning", "DDP", "multi‑GPU", "testing", "callback", "submodule", "top module", "trainer", "BoringModel"], "summary_hash": "a05b9a8a443e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:35:41+00:00"}
