{"summary": "The module provides utilities for preparing supervised fine‑tuning data for T5 models. It includes an in‑memory dataset class that transforms GPT‑style SFT records into source‑target pairs suitable for sequence‑to‑sequence training, handling tokenization, indexing, length calculation, and batch collation. A helper function is declared for converting data file formats.", "business_intent": "To streamline the creation of training datasets for T5 fine‑tuning within the NeMo framework, enabling users to efficiently convert existing SFT data into the required seq2seq format and feed it into model training pipelines.", "keywords": ["T5", "supervised fine-tuning", "dataset", "seq2seq", "tokenization", "NeMo", "language modeling", "data conversion", "in-memory", "batch collation"], "summary_hash": "28d8cc32334d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:30:38+00:00"}
