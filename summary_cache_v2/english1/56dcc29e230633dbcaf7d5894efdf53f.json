{"summary": "The module defines configurable token‑classification models for natural‑language processing, focusing on restoring punctuation and capitalization in text, especially ASR transcripts. It includes a generic BERT‑based token classifier, a specialized model for punctuation and capitalization, and an extended multimodal version that fuses lexical embeddings from a language encoder with acoustic embeddings from an ASR encoder. The package supplies dataclass configurations, model architectures, training/validation/testing pipelines, loss aggregation, metric reporting, and utilities for adapter integration within the NeMo framework.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to improve the readability and downstream utility of speech‑to‑text outputs and other token‑level labeling tasks by providing ready‑to‑train and inference‑ready models that can be customized, extended, and deployed in production NLP pipelines.", "keywords": ["token classification", "punctuation restoration", "capitalization", "BERT encoder", "multimodal", "acoustic embeddings", "ASR integration", "NeMo", "configuration", "training pipeline", "inference"], "summary_hash": "d34b59b24d2c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:11:17+00:00"}
