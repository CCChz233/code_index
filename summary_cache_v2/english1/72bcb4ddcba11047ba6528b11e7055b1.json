{"summary": "The module implements the client‑side component of a federated learning system built on MONAI. It defines abstract base classes that manage the client lifecycle, collect local data statistics, and expose a generic interface for training, model parameter access, and evaluation. A concrete implementation loads MONAI bundles, sets up training and validation pipelines, handles device placement and checkpointing, and can return either full model weights or weight deltas for aggregation, optionally computing detailed statistics such as histograms.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, platform‑agnostic client framework that enables secure, collaborative training of medical imaging models across distributed sites, reducing data movement while supporting model versioning, performance monitoring, and privacy‑preserving weight updates.", "keywords": ["federated learning", "client algorithm", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "model weight differences", "data statistics", "histograms", "checkpointing", "device allocation", "bundle loading", "training workflow", "evaluation workflow", "abstract base classes", "lifecycle management"], "summary_hash": "8352adaf6fdf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:29:50+00:00"}
