{"summary": "This module implements the Pseudo Numerical Diffusion Model (PNDM) scheduler, offering deterministic sampling for diffusion-based generative models. It defines an enumeration for supported prediction strategies (noise and velocity) and a scheduler class that computes the diffusion steps, manages timesteps, and updates latent variables during inference.", "business_intent": "Enable fast and reliable generation of synthetic medical images by providing an optimized diffusion scheduler that integrates with the MONAI framework for research and clinical applications.", "keywords": ["PNDM", "diffusion scheduler", "prediction type", "epsilon", "velocity", "denoising diffusion", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "generative models", "inference"], "summary_hash": "7f51571c0962", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:20:03+00:00"}
