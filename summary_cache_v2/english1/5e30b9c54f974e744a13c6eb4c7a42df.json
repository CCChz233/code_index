{"summary": "This module implements a backend‑agnostic estimator primitive that computes expectation values of quantum circuits with respect to Pauli observables. It wraps any Qiskit backend, handling circuit preprocessing, transpilation, measurement circuit generation, execution, and post‑processing to return expectation values and variances via the BaseEstimator interface.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use tool for quantum‑computing applications—such as chemistry, optimization, and machine‑learning—that need accurate expectation‑value calculations on real or simulated quantum hardware, abstracting away low‑level backend details.", "keywords": ["estimator", "expectation value", "quantum circuit", "Pauli observable", "backend", "transpilation", "execution", "variance", "Qiskit", "primitive"], "summary_hash": "1bc5d122cf3a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:54:19+00:00"}
