{"summary": "The module defines a configurable 3‑D variational autoencoder tailored for video diffusion models. It includes encoder and decoder pipelines with down‑sampling, up‑sampling, a central processing stage, and 3‑D residual blocks. Supporting components such as per‑frame group normalization, randomized Fourier feature mapping, and attention processors enable efficient handling of high‑dimensional video tensors. The VAE outputs a latent Gaussian distribution regularized by KL divergence and applies a scaling factor to align the latent space with diffusion model requirements, while offering tiled, framewise, and gradient‑checkpointed processing to reduce memory consumption.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑performance, memory‑efficient VAE that compresses and reconstructs video data for generative diffusion pipelines, enabling scalable training and fast inference of video generation models.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "KL divergence", "video diffusion", "3‑D convolution", "encoder", "decoder", "latent space", "group normalization", "Fourier features", "residual blocks", "up‑sampling", "down‑sampling", "gradient checkpointing", "tiled processing", "framewise processing", "MoChi", "attention processor"], "summary_hash": "cd0349d2d21e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:44:35+00:00"}
