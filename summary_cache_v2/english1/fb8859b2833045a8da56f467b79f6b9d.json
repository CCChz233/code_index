{"summary": "Implements the core 2‑D transformer for CogView‑3+ that processes latent image patches together with text, timestep and resolution condition embeddings. It constructs a configurable stack of transformer blocks with multi‑head attention, positional embeddings, gradient checkpointing and pluggable attention processors, producing transformed latent features for downstream diffusion decoding.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑performance, adaptable transformer backbone that accelerates and refines text‑to‑image generation in diffusion pipelines, enabling developers to integrate and tune the model for various image resolutions and generation speeds.", "keywords": ["transformer", "text-to-image", "diffusion", "latent patches", "multi-head attention", "positional embeddings", "gradient checkpointing", "attention processors", "configurable architecture", "CogView3"], "summary_hash": "d0679e459383", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:37:35+00:00"}
