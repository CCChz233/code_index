{"summary": "The module implements utilities for managing flow‑run input records and the core mechanisms that allow Prefect flows to exchange typed data at runtime. It offers functions to create, read, delete, and filter input entries, resolve flow identifiers, and handle JSON (optionally validated with Pydantic). It also defines abstractions for sending, receiving, and responding to inputs, with iterator helpers that work in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts, enabling two‑way communication between distributed flow executions.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, runtime‑driven input system that lets workflows request, supply, and react to data dynamically across distributed Prefect flow runs, supporting both sync and async patterns for real‑time orchestration.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "flow run", "runtime input", "data exchange", "synchronous", "asynchronous", "iterator", "two‑way communication", "distributed workflow", "JSON serialization", "Pydantic validation"], "summary_hash": "14fae89285f7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:59:38+00:00"}
