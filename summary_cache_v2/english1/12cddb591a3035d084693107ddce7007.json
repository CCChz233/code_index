{"summary": "The module provides a complete example script for fine‑tuning the Stable Diffusion XL text‑to‑image diffusion model. It parses training arguments, loads and preprocesses a dataset, imports the model components, sets up the optimizer, learning‑rate scheduler and optional EMA, runs a distributed training loop with checkpointing and optional logging, and saves the resulting model and model card.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to adapt a large pre‑trained text‑to‑image diffusion model to their own visual domains, improving generation relevance and quality for specialized applications such as marketing, design, or content creation.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion xl", "text-to-image", "fine-tuning", "diffusion model", "accelerate", "distributed training", "dataset preprocessing", "checkpointing", "learning rate scheduler", "model card"], "summary_hash": "d2e61542e4cd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:05:26+00:00"}
