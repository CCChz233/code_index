{"summary": "This module implements a Flax-based linear multistep (LMS) scheduler for diffusion models using discrete beta schedules. It defines a scheduler class that handles configuration, state tracking, input scaling, LMS coefficient calculation, and sample updates across diffusion timesteps, along with a state container class.", "business_intent": "Provide a high-performance, configurable scheduler for JAX/Flax diffusion model inference, enabling fast and accurate sample generation in applications such as image synthesis, video generation, and other generative AI tasks.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "linear multistep", "LMS", "Flax", "JAX", "beta schedule", "sampling", "Karras", "configuration", "state management"], "summary_hash": "5a533175b1a5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:12:49+00:00"}
