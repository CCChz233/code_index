{"summary": "Provides utilities to trim and filter spatial line and point datasets so that they fit within the active cells of a MODFLOW‑6 grid. It handles various data structures (GeoDataFrames, xarray DataArrays, XUGrid objects) and includes logic to remove geometry intersecting inactive cells and to convert between line and polygon representations for head‑flow‑boundary data.", "business_intent": "Enables modelers to preprocess spatial input data by restricting it to the model domain, ensuring that only relevant active cells are considered and improving downstream simulation accuracy and efficiency.", "keywords": ["clipping", "grid", "active cells", "MODFLOW 6", "spatial data", "linestring", "head‑flow‑boundary", "geodataframe", "xarray", "xugrid", "spatial filtering"], "summary_hash": "9644f751b9ff", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:01:09+00:00"}
