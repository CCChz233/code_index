{"summary": "A Keras wrapper that enforces spectral normalization on a target layer's weight matrix (or embeddings), dynamically scaling the weights to keep their spectral norm bounded using a configurable number of power‑iteration steps. This constrains the layer's Lipschitz constant, which helps stabilize training, particularly for generative adversarial networks.", "business_intent": "Enable deep‑learning engineers to improve the stability and convergence of GANs and other models that benefit from Lipschitz‑controlled layers by providing an easy‑to‑use spectral‑norm regularization component.", "keywords": ["spectral normalization", "Lipschitz constraint", "GAN stabilization", "weight regularization", "Keras wrapper", "power iterations", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "0ef6eb9dc74a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:58:26+00:00"}
