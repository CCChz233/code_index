{"summary": "This test module defines simple helper flows and a suite of async tests that verify Prefect's asyncio-based concurrency and rate‑limit primitives. The tests exercise acquiring and releasing concurrency slots, mixing synchronous and asynchronous tasks, and confirm that the appropriate events are emitted and the API orchestration behaves as expected.", "business_intent": "Validate that Prefect's asynchronous concurrency control and rate‑limiting mechanisms function correctly within flows, ensuring proper slot management, mixed sync/async execution, and event emission for monitoring and compliance.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "asyncio", "concurrency", "rate limiting", "flow", "testing", "events", "slots", "orchestration"], "summary_hash": "b6c964dc8386", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:12:22+00:00"}
