{"summary": "A utility that divides a multi‑dimensional image tensor along a chosen axis, producing a list of slice views. It can retain the split axis as a singleton dimension or squeeze it, and optionally propagates updated metadata to each slice.", "business_intent": "Simplify image preprocessing pipelines by enabling easy conversion of volumetric or multi‑channel data into individual 2‑D frames or single‑channel images, supporting downstream analysis, visualization, or model input preparation.", "keywords": ["image splitting", "tensor dimension", "slice view", "keep dimension", "metadata update", "preprocessing", "3D to 2D conversion", "channel separation"], "summary_hash": "b8f9d7e34eb1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:56:22+00:00"}
