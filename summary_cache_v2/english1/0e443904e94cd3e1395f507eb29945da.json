{"summary": "The file defines an Accelerator class that abstracts and manages distributed training, mixed precision, gradient accumulation, and various plugins (DeepSpeed, FSDP, MegatronLM). It handles device placement, synchronization, logging, checkpointing, and state management, providing a high-level interface for scalable deep learning workflows.", "business_intent": "Simplify the development of scalable deep learning models by providing a unified, high-level API that handles the complexities of multi‑GPU/TPU training, mixed‑precision computation, and integration with performance‑optimizing plugins, allowing users to focus on model logic rather than infrastructure details.", "keywords": ["distributed training", "mixed precision", "gradient accumulation", "device placement", "DeepSpeed", "FSDP", "MegatronLM", "logging", "checkpointing", "synchronization", "torch dynamo", "optimizer scaling", "profiling"], "summary_hash": "ae8e2ff1f61c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:18:10+00:00"}
