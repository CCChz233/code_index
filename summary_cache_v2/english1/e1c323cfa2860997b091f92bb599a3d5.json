{"summary": "The script runs a ray‑tracing simulation to generate the cumulative point‑spread function of a specified telescope, optionally loads measured PSF data, compares the two, visualises the cumulative PSF and the PSF image, and reports the d80 metric. Command‑line options let the user select site, telescope model, version, source distance, zenith angle, custom parameter files and a fast test mode.", "business_intent": "Provide a quick validation tool for telescope optical models by comparing simulated PSF performance against empirical measurements, enabling model tuning and performance verification.", "keywords": ["cumulative PSF", "ray tracing", "telescope validation", "simulation", "data comparison", "d80", "visualisation", "command line", "model parameters", "zenith angle", "source distance"], "summary_hash": "211b294ab051", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:50:11+00:00"}
