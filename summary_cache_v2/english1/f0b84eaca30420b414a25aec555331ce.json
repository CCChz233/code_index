{"summary": "This module provides PyTorch/DGL implementations of graph‑based post‑processing models, including a two‑stage correct‑and‑smooth routine that first corrects predictions via label propagation and then smooths them, a standalone label propagation model, and configurable multilayer perceptron components for building neural networks.", "business_intent": "Enhance the performance of semi‑supervised node classification and related graph analytics (e.g., recommendation, fraud detection, social network analysis) by leveraging graph structure to refine and smooth model outputs, thereby increasing prediction accuracy and robustness.", "keywords": ["graph neural networks", "label propagation", "correct and smooth", "node classification", "semi-supervised learning", "PyTorch", "DGL", "multilayer perceptron", "adjacency normalization", "graph post‑processing"], "summary_hash": "79d7d857416c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:21:11+00:00"}
