{"summary": "This module offers a reusable circuit template that constructs a two‑qubit operation composed of a CX gate, a parameterized phase gate, and another CX, implemented via RZX interactions and additional single‑qubit rotations. The generated circuit provides a hardware‑efficient decomposition of a ZZ‑type rotation.", "business_intent": "Supply a ready‑made, hardware‑friendly circuit building block for developers and compilers to realize the CX‑Phase‑CX pattern, facilitating optimized synthesis and execution of specific two‑qubit gates within quantum algorithms.", "keywords": ["RZX", "circuit template", "two-qubit gate", "decomposition", "CX", "PhaseGate", "quantum circuit", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "76b2b0fb513a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:20:46+00:00"}
