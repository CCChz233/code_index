{"summary": "The class provides a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the GatesInBasis validation pass, checking that circuits only contain gates from a specified basis under various conditions such as after translation, with different target specifications, empty bases or circuits, partial qubit coverage, and control‑flow structures.", "business_intent": "Validate that the GatesInBasis pass reliably detects both compliance and violations of a gate basis across diverse circuit configurations, ensuring correctness of quantum compilation and optimization workflows.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "quantum circuit validation", "gate basis compliance", "translation handling", "target specification", "empty circuit", "control flow", "quantum compilation"], "summary_hash": "889a9330a769", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:31:53+00:00"}
