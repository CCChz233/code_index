{"summary": "The module provides a complete example for training a Graph Attention Network (GAT) on citation graph datasets using TensorFlow and DGL. It handles argument parsing, dataset loading, model construction with multi‑head batching and sparse matrix‑vector (SPMV) optimization, runs the training loop, and reports accuracy and loss metrics.", "business_intent": "To illustrate how to implement and train a GAT model on standard graph benchmarks, serving as a reference/tutorial for developers and researchers working with graph neural networks in TensorFlow.", "keywords": ["TensorFlow", "DGL", "Graph Attention Network", "GAT", "citation datasets", "Cora", "Citeseer", "Pubmed", "training script", "multi‑head batching", "SPMV optimization", "accuracy evaluation", "graph neural network"], "summary_hash": "7d7fab3f603f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:11:20+00:00"}
