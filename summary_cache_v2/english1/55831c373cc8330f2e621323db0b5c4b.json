{"summary": "This module supplies legacy TPU components—strategy, accelerator, and precision plugins—that act as thin wrappers around the newer XLA‑based implementations, preserving the original interfaces for existing code. It also includes internal helpers that adjust class references and system modules to maintain compatibility.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless operation of older user code that relies on deprecated TPU APIs while steering developers toward the updated XLA equivalents, thereby reducing breakage during library upgrades.", "keywords": ["TPU", "XLA", "compatibility", "deprecated", "legacy", "strategy", "accelerator", "precision plugin", "backward compatibility", "patching", "PyTorch Lightning"], "summary_hash": "59a9efbfc522", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:56:19+00:00"}
