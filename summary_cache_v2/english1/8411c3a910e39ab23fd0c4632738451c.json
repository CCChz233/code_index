{"summary": "The module contains automated test suites for the Kandinsky V2.2 ControlNet image generation pipeline. It defines fast unit tests that construct lightweight dummy components, feed synthetic inputs, and verify behaviours such as float‑16 handling, batch consistency, and proper ControlNet conditioning. An integration test class sets up the full pipeline, runs inference on real data, and checks that the generated images match expected outputs, handling environment preparation and cleanup.", "business_intent": "Validate and guarantee the correctness, stability, and performance of the Kandinsky V2.2 ControlNet pipeline within the Diffusers library, supporting reliable deployment of advanced image generation models.", "keywords": ["Kandinsky", "ControlNet", "pipeline", "unit tests", "integration tests", "image generation", "diffusers", "float16", "batch consistency", "GPU", "deterministic testing"], "summary_hash": "2c959ba82dfe", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:55:33+00:00"}
