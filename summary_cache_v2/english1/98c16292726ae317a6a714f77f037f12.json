{"summary": "The script provides a workflow for transforming Stable Diffusion ControlNet models, including standard and XL UNet variants, from PyTorch implementations into ONNX format. It defines model wrappers, performs graph optimizations to remove redundancies and infer shapes, and handles the export process with version checks and file management.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the deployment of ControlNet‑enhanced diffusion models in production environments by delivering optimized ONNX representations that can be executed efficiently on diverse hardware through ONNX Runtime.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "controlnet", "onnx conversion", "graph optimization", "unet", "diffusion model", "inference acceleration", "torch export", "model deployment", "pipeline"], "summary_hash": "03b4799e5697", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:43:19+00:00"}
