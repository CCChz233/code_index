{"summary": "This module implements a suite of neural network models for speech enhancement and audio-to-audio transformation. It provides encoder‑mask‑decoder architectures, predictive models that estimate encoded audio coefficients, and score‑based generative approaches, handling data preprocessing, forward propagation, loss computation, and training/evaluation workflows within the NeMo framework.", "business_intent": "To improve the quality of recorded speech by removing noise, reverberation, and other distortions, thereby boosting the performance of downstream automatic speech recognition, voice communication, and assistive listening applications.", "keywords": ["speech enhancement", "audio denoising", "encoder‑mask‑decoder", "predictive audio modeling", "score‑based generative model", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "speech processing", "ASR preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "7d9c322007d2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:11:09+00:00"}
