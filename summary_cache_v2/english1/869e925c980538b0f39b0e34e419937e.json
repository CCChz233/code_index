{"summary": "Provides a dataset interface that reads audio recordings stored inside tar archives, using a JSON manifest to map each entry to its transcript and metadata. It handles on‑the‑fly extraction, optional resampling, augmentation, duration filtering, text normalization, and token padding, while supporting configurable shuffling, shard distribution strategies, and distributed‑training partitioning.", "business_intent": "Facilitate scalable and efficient loading of large speech‑recognition corpora packaged as tar files, enabling fast training and evaluation of ASR models in single‑node or multi‑node environments.", "keywords": ["tarred audio dataset", "speech recognition", "manifest parsing", "sharding", "distributed training", "audio augmentation", "duration filtering", "text normalization", "token padding", "shuffle buffer"], "summary_hash": "44e9b49ec433", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:16:23+00:00"}
