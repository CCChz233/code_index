{"summary": "The module implements a flexible image‑writing framework that prepares multi‑dimensional image arrays and their associated spatial metadata for persistent storage. It defines a generic writer base that normalises dimension ordering, handles channel placement, applies affine transformations, optionally resamples data, and converts data types before delegating to format‑specific subclasses. Concrete writers support ITK, NIfTI (via nibabel) and common image formats (via Pillow), encapsulating the logic required to serialize both pixel data and metadata correctly.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable, extensible solution for persisting medical imaging data with accurate spatial information, enabling downstream clinical and research workflows to exchange, visualise, and analyse images across diverse file formats.", "keywords": ["image writing", "medical imaging", "metadata handling", "affine transformation", "resampling", "channel ordering", "data type conversion", "ITK", "NIfTI", "Pillow", "writer registry"], "summary_hash": "575fa1aced95", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:11:32+00:00"}
