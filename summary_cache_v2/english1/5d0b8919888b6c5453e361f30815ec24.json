{"summary": "This test suite validates the collective communication plugins used in Lightning Fabric. It checks that a single-device collective plugin can be instantiated without arguments and correctly creates its communication group, and that the TorchCollective plugin can create, manage, and clean up process groups, supports default and custom groups, and functions properly on both CPU and CUDA devices.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and correctness of distributed communication components in Lightning Fabric, enabling stable multi‑device training workflows and reducing runtime errors in production environments.", "keywords": ["unit tests", "collective communication", "Lightning Fabric", "process groups", "single-device plugin", "TorchCollective", "CPU", "CUDA", "distributed training", "plugin validation"], "summary_hash": "33889146d61a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:11:17+00:00"}
