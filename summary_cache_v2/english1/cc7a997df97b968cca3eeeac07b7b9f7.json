{"summary": "A Keras layer that enlarges 2‑D feature maps by scaling rows and columns according to a specified factor, using selectable interpolation methods (nearest, bilinear, bicubic, lanczos, etc.). It handles both channel‑first and channel‑last tensor formats and automatically computes the upsampled output shape.", "business_intent": "Provides a convenient way for deep‑learning models to increase the spatial resolution of intermediate feature maps, supporting decoder, segmentation, and super‑resolution architectures.", "keywords": ["upsampling", "2D", "interpolation", "nearest", "bilinear", "bicubic", "lanczos", "keras layer", "image resizing", "data format", "size factor", "spatial scaling"], "summary_hash": "c5bcc28c3171", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:57:23+00:00"}
