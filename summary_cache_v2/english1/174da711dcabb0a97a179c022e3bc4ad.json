{"summary": "The script builds a distributed training workflow for a text classification model using PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and the Accelerate library. It loads a dataset, tokenizes the text, creates data loaders, configures a model, optimizer, and learning‑rate scheduler, and runs training with a custom DDP communication hook to modify gradient exchange across GPUs. After training, it evaluates the model on a validation split.", "business_intent": "Provide a practical example that helps engineers implement and benchmark custom DDP communication hooks for more efficient multi‑GPU training of NLP models, facilitating reduced communication overhead and faster convergence in production‑scale deep learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["Distributed Data Parallel", "communication hook", "Accelerate", "PyTorch", "Transformers", "sequence classification", "tokenization", "data loading", "gradient compression", "multi‑GPU training"], "summary_hash": "953460c1b3f2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:17:15+00:00"}
