{"summary": "The module implements tree-structured Long Short-Term Memory (Tree‑LSTM) components using MXNet and DGL, including variants that aggregate child node representations (e.g., child‑sum) and a layer that recursively propagates hidden states through hierarchical graph structures.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable toolkit for building and experimenting with neural models that capture hierarchical relationships in data, enabling applications such as parsing, semantic representation, and other tasks that benefit from tree‑based deep learning architectures.", "keywords": ["Tree LSTM", "hierarchical neural network", "recursive neural network", "MXNet", "DGL", "semantic representation", "natural language processing", "graph neural network", "child-sum"], "summary_hash": "314bd0b56dfd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:10:26+00:00"}
