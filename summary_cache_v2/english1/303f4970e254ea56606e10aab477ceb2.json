{"summary": "The module implements two diffusion pipelines that integrate Stable Diffusion (including the XL family) with K‑diffusion samplers. It provides a unified interface for text‑to‑image generation, handling model wrapping (VAE, UNet, CLIP), preprocessing, advanced noise scheduling (Karras, Brownian tree), and denoising strategies. The pipelines also support fine‑tuning and extension mechanisms such as LoRA adapters, IP‑Adapter, and textual inversion, enabling flexible and high‑quality image synthesis.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to generate images from text prompts using Stable Diffusion models enhanced with K‑diffusion samplers, while offering extensibility for custom adapters and fine‑tuning techniques to improve quality and adaptability for various AI‑generated content applications.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "k-diffusion", "text-to-image", "pipeline", "LoRA", "IP-Adapter", "textual inversion", "noise scheduling", "Karras", "Brownian tree", "image synthesis", "UNet", "VAE", "CLIP"], "summary_hash": "6cd178b93e6f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:41:21+00:00"}
