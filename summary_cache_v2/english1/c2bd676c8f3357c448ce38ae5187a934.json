{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that creates images from textual prompts while grounding them to user‑specified regions using the GLIGEN framework. The pipeline orchestrates VAE encoding/decoding, CLIP text encoding, UNet denoising, scheduler stepping, and optional safety checking to produce region‑aware generated images.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and creators to generate spatially controlled, high‑quality images for use cases such as advertising, design mockups, virtual staging, and other content‑creation workflows that require precise placement of visual elements.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "GLIGEN", "text-to-image", "region grounding", "diffusion pipeline", "VAE", "UNet", "CLIP", "safety checker", "scheduler", "PyTorch", "transformers"], "summary_hash": "65817da3f532", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:20:53+00:00"}
