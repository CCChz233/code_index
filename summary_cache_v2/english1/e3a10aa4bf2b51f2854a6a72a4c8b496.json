{"summary": "Provides a Lightning PyTorch plugin that activates half‑precision (float16 or bfloat16) training. It automatically converts model parameters, inputs, and tensors to the selected half‑precision dtype and supplies context managers to control the precision mode during forward passes and model initialization.", "business_intent": "Accelerate deep‑learning training by reducing memory usage and increasing throughput through half‑precision arithmetic, while offering seamless integration with the Lightning framework's plugin architecture.", "keywords": ["half precision", "float16", "bfloat16", "mixed precision", "PyTorch", "Lightning", "plugin", "dtype conversion", "context manager", "training acceleration"], "summary_hash": "879f755c57d4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:00:14+00:00"}
