{"summary": "This module provides a reference implementation for distributed multi‑GPU training of a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) combined with a multilayer perceptron classifier to perform graph property prediction. It loads OGB graph datasets, constructs DGL data loaders that operate across processes, defines the GIN layer and MLP architecture, runs a synchronized training loop with gradient averaging, and includes optional evaluation of the model.", "business_intent": "Offer developers and researchers a ready‑to‑run example that showcases how to scale graph neural network training across several GPUs using PyTorch and DGL, facilitating rapid prototyping and deployment of high‑performance graph property prediction pipelines.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "DGL", "multi‑GPU", "distributed training", "graph neural network", "GIN", "graph property prediction", "OGB dataset", "GraphDataLoader", "MLP", "gradient synchronization", "reference implementation"], "summary_hash": "4e25b6f2e4cc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:24:35+00:00"}
