{"summary": "The module implements three string‑based evaluation metrics for single‑turn RAG samples: an exact match scorer, a lightweight non‑LLM similarity calculator, and a presence detector that checks for required substrings. Each metric integrates with the ragas metric framework, handling initialization, per‑turn scoring, and aggregation of results.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and data scientists to quantitatively assess the correctness, relevance, and completeness of generated text in retrieval‑augmented generation pipelines, facilitating model benchmarking and quality monitoring.", "keywords": ["string evaluation", "exact match", "similarity scoring", "presence detection", "RAG metrics", "text quality assessment", "non‑LLM algorithms", "single‑turn evaluation"], "summary_hash": "821898825296", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:49:32+00:00"}
