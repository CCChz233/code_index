{"summary": "This module provides a comprehensive test suite for the Modflow6 simulation components of the iMOD library. It sets up various groundwater model configurations, exercises simulation creation, partitioning, regridding, and I/O operations, and validates that model data, well definitions, and output controls are correctly preserved across serialization cycles and compatible with legacy formats.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the correctness and robustness of groundwater modeling workflows by automatically verifying that Modflow6 simulations can be constructed, manipulated, and exchanged reliably, thereby supporting developers and end‑users in delivering accurate hydrological analyses.", "keywords": ["Modflow6", "groundwater modeling", "simulation testing", "roundtrip validation", "model partitioning", "regridding", "well handling", "output control", "iMOD", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "4928876b392b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:53:52+00:00"}
