{"summary": "Provides the Cython compiler with classes and utilities to represent, validate, and generate C code for memoryview slices and their iteration. It handles contiguous and strided slicing, computes shape and stride metadata, and supplies helper functions for buffer flags, mode handling, and utility code integration.", "business_intent": "Enable the Cython compilation process to efficiently support NumPy‑like memoryview operations, including slicing, iteration, and contiguity checks, thereby delivering high‑performance array handling in generated C code.", "keywords": ["memoryview", "slice", "iterator", "Cython", "compiler", "code generation", "buffer", "stride", "contiguity", "validation", "utility code"], "summary_hash": "c141348eb463", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:27:54+00:00"}
