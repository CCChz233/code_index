{"summary": "This module implements a full training workflow for a ControlNet diffusion model using the Flax/JAX backend. It handles argument parsing, dataset loading and preprocessing, caption tokenization, model initialization, loss and gradient computation, optimizer updates, checkpointing, and optional model card creation for publishing on Hugging Face.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example that enables researchers and engineers to fine‑tune ControlNet models on custom image‑control datasets, accelerating the development of conditional image generation capabilities.", "keywords": ["ControlNet", "Flax", "JAX", "diffusion", "training", "dataset preprocessing", "caption tokenization", "gradient computation", "optimizer", "checkpointing", "model card", "Hugging Face"], "summary_hash": "021ab495964c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:57:53+00:00"}
