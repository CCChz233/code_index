{"summary": "This module contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the particle handling classes in the library. The tests verify correct initialization, property values, category handling, inversion behavior, equality, JSON serialization/deserialization, error and warning raising, and interaction with custom particle definitions and molecules.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the correctness and robustness of the particle representation API, preventing regressions and ensuring that physical attributes, categorization, and data interchange functions behave as expected for scientific plasma simulations.", "keywords": ["particle", "antiparticle", "inversion", "custom particle", "molecule", "JSON serialization", "unit testing", "error handling", "warning handling", "category validation", "mass", "charge", "plasma physics"], "summary_hash": "6218bc80a067", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:10:35+00:00"}
