{"summary": "The module defines a deterministic AutoAugment implementation for ImageNet, providing a collection of predefined augmentation sub‑policies and a policy class that randomly selects and applies one of these sub‑policies to an input image. It leverages PIL and NumPy to perform operations such as rotation, translation, color adjustments, and cutout, and is intended to be used as a transform within PyTorch data pipelines.", "business_intent": "To enhance the training data variability for computer‑vision models, thereby improving model generalization, accuracy, and robustness on ImageNet‑scale datasets.", "keywords": ["autoaugment", "image augmentation", "ImageNet", "PyTorch transform", "computer vision", "data preprocessing", "augmentation policy", "random augmentation", "PIL", "image enhancement"], "summary_hash": "600ebc6a6ba8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:19:25+00:00"}
