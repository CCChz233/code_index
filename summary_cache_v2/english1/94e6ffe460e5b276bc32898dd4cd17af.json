{"summary": "The module implements utilities for generating negative edge samples in graph neural network training. It provides a generic callable sampler component and two concrete strategies: a uniform random sampler that creates negative edges across heterogeneous edge types by drawing source and destination nodes uniformly, and a per-source uniform sampler that draws a configurable number of negative destinations for each source node. The samplers handle self‑loops, replacement, and edge existence constraints.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient and configurable negative edge generation for link prediction and related tasks in graph neural network pipelines, especially for heterogeneous graphs.", "keywords": ["negative sampling", "graph neural networks", "link prediction", "heterogeneous graph", "uniform random", "source node", "destination node", "self-loop", "replacement", "edge type", "sampler", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "a01c6fac8d7c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:36:20+00:00"}
