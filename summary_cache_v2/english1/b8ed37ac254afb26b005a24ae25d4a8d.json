{"summary": "Implements an online Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm tailored for heterogeneous graphs that encode document‑to‑word meta‑paths. The class builds and updates internal word and document statistics, performs expectation‑maximization steps, and modifies the underlying graph attributes to reflect learned topic distributions. It supports fitting on full or incremental data, computing perplexity, generating topic predictions, sampling new documents, and persisting the model.", "business_intent": "Enable enterprises to extract latent topics from large graph‑based text corpora, improve content classification, recommendation, and insight generation while leveraging GPU acceleration and scalable online updates.", "keywords": ["latent Dirichlet allocation", "heterogeneous graph", "topic modeling", "online learning", "Dirichlet prior", "expectation‑maximization", "perplexity", "sampling", "graph updates", "GPU acceleration"], "summary_hash": "7c4af864089a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:15:08+00:00"}
