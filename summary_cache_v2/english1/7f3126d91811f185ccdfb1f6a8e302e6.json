{"summary": "The module illustrates how to combine a genetic algorithm with multiple MAPDL instances running on an HPC cluster. It creates a pool of MAPDL processes, distributes beam analysis jobs across the pool, evaluates each candidate design, and uses the results to guide the evolutionary optimization.", "business_intent": "Provide engineers and researchers with a practical example for accelerating structural design optimization by leveraging parallel MAPDL simulations within a genetic‑algorithm workflow on high‑performance computing resources.", "keywords": ["genetic algorithm", "PyMAPDL", "MAPDL pool", "HPC", "parallel simulation", "beam optimization", "structural analysis", "pygad", "fitness evaluation", "distributed computing"], "summary_hash": "b169d75beaae", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:56:55+00:00"}
