{"summary": "This module implements forward and backward multi‑head attention operations using NVIDIA's CUTLASS library. It provides configurable kernels for various data types and GPU architectures, including legacy devices without Tensor Cores, and integrates attention bias and masking utilities. Helper classes enable execution and diagnostic reporting, while a custom mask type is defined for potential user‑defined binary masks.", "business_intent": "Accelerate transformer‑based models on NVIDIA GPUs by offering high‑performance, flexible attention kernels that can be registered and used within the xformers library, supporting a wide range of hardware and mask configurations.", "keywords": ["multi-head attention", "CUTLASS", "GPU", "forward", "backward", "attention bias", "masking", "tensor cores", "legacy support", "PyTorch", "operator registration"], "summary_hash": "b4bf15a7c75a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:33:19+00:00"}
