{"summary": "The module implements an image retrieval pipeline that extracts CLIP embeddings from images, builds a FAISS vector index, and enables fast similarity search for individual or batch queries. It includes configuration handling, dataset loading utilities, and preprocessing helpers for image normalization and feature extraction.", "business_intent": "To provide a reusable component for research and applications that need to locate visually similar images efficiently using state-of-the-art CLIP representations and scalable nearest-neighbor indexing.", "keywords": ["image retrieval", "CLIP embeddings", "FAISS index", "vector similarity", "dataset preprocessing", "feature extraction", "nearest neighbor search", "machine learning"], "summary_hash": "2e8bf07aeeb1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:06:39+00:00"}
