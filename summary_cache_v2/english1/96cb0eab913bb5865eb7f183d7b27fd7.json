{"summary": "The module defines a comprehensive suite of unit tests that verify the functionality of the plasma analysis fitting utilities, including abstract base class behavior and concrete fitting implementations such as exponential, exponential-plus-linear, exponential-plus-offset, and linear models. The tests cover object creation, inheritance, callable interface, parameter management, error handling, string representation, curve fitting, and root‑finding capabilities.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the correctness and robustness of the fitting functions used in plasma physics analysis, enabling reliable scientific computations and preventing regressions in the library's numerical tools.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "fit functions", "plasma analysis", "abstract base class", "exponential model", "linear model", "curve fitting", "root solving", "parameter validation", "error handling", "pytest", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "4360dc54a7df", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:11:58+00:00"}
