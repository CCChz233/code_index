{"summary": "The module defines utilities for testing a custom language model integration, including an iterator that parses streamed response chunks and a wrapper that abstracts text completion, streaming, and image generation calls. It contains a suite of test cases that verify provider detection, synchronous and asynchronous completions, streaming behavior, and image generation with additional parameters.", "business_intent": "Ensure that a custom LLM can be seamlessly used through the litellm framework, validating correct handling of completions, streaming responses, and image generation in both sync and async contexts to guarantee reliable integration in production environments.", "keywords": ["custom LLM", "streaming", "asynchronous", "completion", "image generation", "litellm", "testing", "iterator", "provider detection", "HTTP handler"], "summary_hash": "41e7244bdb27", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:31:06+00:00"}
