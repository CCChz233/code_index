{"summary": "The module provides a command‑line example that demonstrates how to perform image‑to‑image generation using a Stable Diffusion model accelerated with ONNX, enhanced by ControlNet conditioning. It defines a custom pipeline class that integrates ONNX runtime execution, prompt handling, image preprocessing, latent space scheduling, and result decoding, and orchestrates the end‑to‑end workflow from loading models to saving generated images.", "business_intent": "To illustrate a high‑performance, low‑resource inference solution for ControlNet‑guided image transformation, enabling developers and researchers to deploy Stable Diffusion pipelines with ONNX for faster, cheaper generation in production or research environments.", "keywords": ["ONNX", "Stable Diffusion", "ControlNet", "image-to-image generation", "diffusers", "pipeline", "command line", "inference acceleration", "latent scheduling", "prompt conditioning"], "summary_hash": "9efd42893f71", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:02:29+00:00"}
