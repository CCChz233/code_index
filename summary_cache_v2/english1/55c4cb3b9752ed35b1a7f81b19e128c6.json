{"summary": "Implements an experimental Stable Diffusion pipeline that performs text‑conditioned image inpainting by encoding images into latent space, applying a conditional UNet denoiser guided by a CLIP text encoder, and decoding the result back to pixels, with optional safety checking and support for loading custom weights such as LoRA or textual inversion.", "business_intent": "Provides developers and content creators a ready‑to‑use tool for automated image editing and generation, enabling applications like retouching, object removal, or creative augmentation driven by natural language prompts while maintaining safety compliance.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "inpainting", "text‑guided image editing", "latent diffusion", "UNet denoiser", "CLIP text encoder", "VAE", "safety checker", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "checkpoint loading"], "summary_hash": "0ad6457b4858", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:26:53+00:00"}
