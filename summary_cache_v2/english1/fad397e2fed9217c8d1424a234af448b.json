{"summary": "Applies an affine matrix to a set of points, converting between image (pixel) space and physical world space. Supports 2‑D and 3‑D coordinates, optional inversion of the matrix, and automatic handling of LPS↔RAS orientation differences, returning the transformed points in the original tensor shape.", "business_intent": "Facilitates accurate coordinate mapping in medical imaging workflows, allowing downstream analysis and visualization tools to work interchangeably with image‑based and world‑based point data.", "keywords": ["affine transformation", "point coordinates", "image space", "world space", "2D", "3D", "inverse matrix", "LPS", "RAS", "medical imaging", "coordinate conversion"], "summary_hash": "1ac08a186f23", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:58:05+00:00"}
