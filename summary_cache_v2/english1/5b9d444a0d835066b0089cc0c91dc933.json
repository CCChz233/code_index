{"summary": "A command‑line script that orchestrates training, fine‑tuning, and evaluation of an end‑to‑end CTC‑based automatic speech recognition model using NVIDIA NeMo, Hydra configuration, and PyTorch Lightning. It demonstrates how to override dataset paths, trainer settings, and optimizer parameters directly from the CLI and points to documentation for pretrained models and fine‑tuning configurations.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example that lets developers and researchers quickly train or adapt speech‑to‑text models for their own audio data, facilitating rapid prototyping and deployment of ASR solutions.", "keywords": ["speech recognition", "CTC", "ASR", "model training", "fine‑tuning", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "Hydra", "CLI overrides", "optimizer configuration", "pretrained models"], "summary_hash": "02e679fe6a72", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:39:00+00:00"}
