{"summary": "An example script that demonstrates how to train a transformer model with tensor parallelism using Lightning Fabric. It sets up a random token dataset, configures model arguments, parallelizes the model across devices with a ModelParallelStrategy, and runs a training loop leveraging distributed loss computation.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with a reference implementation for scalable, distributed training of large language models, illustrating the integration of Lightning Fabric, tensor parallelism, and loss parallel techniques.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "Lightning Fabric", "tensor parallelism", "model parallel", "transformer", "distributed training", "loss parallel", "DataLoader", "example"], "summary_hash": "2f88c11c87a2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:50:40+00:00"}
