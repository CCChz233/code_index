{"summary": "This module implements a graph‑based decoder for a Junction Tree Neural Network using DGL and PyTorch. It converts latent representations into molecular graph structures by updating tree nodes, traversing the junction tree, and assembling the final molecule, orchestrating the inference pipeline for molecular generation.", "business_intent": "Enable automated generation of chemically valid molecules from learned latent spaces to support drug discovery and molecular design workflows.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "decoder", "molecular generation", "junction tree", "DGL", "PyTorch", "GRU", "chemical assembly", "latent representation", "inference"], "summary_hash": "c8b63055b5f1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:32:40+00:00"}
