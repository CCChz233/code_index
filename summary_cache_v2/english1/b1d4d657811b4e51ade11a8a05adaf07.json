{"summary": "The module demonstrates how to create a custom picture classification enrichment model and integrate it into a Docling processing pipeline. It defines a callable model that assigns classification labels to suitable picture items, wraps the model in a pipeline that prepares configuration and executes the classification step, and provides a main routine that runs the pipeline on a PDF document to produce enriched output.", "business_intent": "Showcase the extension of the Docling framework with a user‑defined image classification component, enabling automated categorization of pictures in documents for enhanced metadata, searchability, and downstream analytics.", "keywords": ["picture classification", "enrichment model", "processing pipeline", "Docling", "PDF document", "image analysis", "custom model integration", "metadata enrichment", "example script"], "summary_hash": "54ec6ae63849", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:39:05+00:00"}
