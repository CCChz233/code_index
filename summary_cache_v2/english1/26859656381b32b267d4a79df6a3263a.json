{"summary": "The script showcases how to set up and run parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning (PEFT) for a Megatron T5 language model using NVIDIA NeMo. It loads a configuration, builds a Megatron‑based trainer, applies a selected PEFT configuration to the model, and launches the training/evaluation workflow with experiment management utilities.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to quickly fine‑tune large Megatron T5 models with lightweight PEFT techniques for language‑modeling applications, reducing resource requirements and accelerating experimentation.", "keywords": ["Megatron T5", "PEFT", "fine-tuning", "NVIDIA NeMo", "language modeling", "distributed training", "experiment manager", "configuration", "trainer builder"], "summary_hash": "982a77c8d804", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:46:56+00:00"}
