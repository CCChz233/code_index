{"summary": "A command‑line script that trains a model with Model‑Agnostic Meta‑Learning (MAML) using raw PyTorch, the Learn2Learn library and Cherry‑RL utilities. It sets up distributed processes, loads environments from Gym, performs fast adaptation steps on support data, evaluates on query data, and logs metrics such as accuracy.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run reference implementation for researchers and engineers to experiment with scalable meta‑learning, enabling rapid prototyping and distributed training of MAML‑based agents in reinforcement‑learning or vision domains.", "keywords": ["MAML", "meta‑learning", "PyTorch", "Learn2Learn", "distributed training", "torchrun", "Cherry‑RL", "Gym", "accuracy metric", "fast adaptation", "meta‑optimization"], "summary_hash": "922616f5ce21", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:51:06+00:00"}
