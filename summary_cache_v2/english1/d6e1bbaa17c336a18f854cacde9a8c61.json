{"summary": "Implements an explanation engine for heterogeneous graph neural networks. It learns sparse edge and node‑feature masks that highlight the sub‑graph structures and feature subsets most responsible for a GNN’s node or graph classification output, using a regularized loss that balances fidelity, sparsity and entropy.", "business_intent": "Enable users to interpret and audit predictions of heterogeneous GNN models by revealing the critical relationships and attributes influencing decisions, supporting model debugging, compliance, and insight generation.", "keywords": ["heterogeneous graph", "GNN explanation", "edge mask", "feature mask", "interpretability", "sparsity regularization", "entropy regularization", "node classification", "graph classification", "model introspection"], "summary_hash": "8f1db42fe961", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:54:29+00:00"}
