{"summary": "A lightweight container that stores a DeepSpeed configuration dictionary and provides fast queries for specific settings such as the ZeRO optimization stage. It registers a weak reference in the module’s globals so that the configuration can be accessed from parts of the codebase that do not have a Trainer instance, and it is designed to stay alive for the duration of the program.", "business_intent": "Facilitate seamless access to DeepSpeed parameters across the Hugging Face training pipeline, allowing components like model loading and embedding resizing to retrieve configuration details without needing a full Trainer object, thereby simplifying integration and reducing coupling.", "keywords": ["DeepSpeed", "configuration", "ZeRO stage", "weak reference", "global access", "Hugging Face", "training pipeline", "settings retrieval"], "summary_hash": "adf6ffdc4bab", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T07:55:15+00:00"}
