{"summary": "A Keras callback that temporarily replaces a model's current weights with the optimizer's exponential moving average (EMA) weights during evaluation phases (validation, testing, prediction) and optionally at epoch boundaries, then restores the original weights, enabling metrics and checkpoints to be computed using the smoother EMA parameters without extra memory overhead.", "business_intent": "Leverage Polyak averaging to obtain more stable and potentially higher‑performing evaluation results and model checkpoints by using EMA weights during inference and training callbacks.", "keywords": ["EMA", "exponential moving average", "weight swapping", "callback", "model evaluation", "checkpoint", "Polyak averaging", "memory efficient", "optimizer"], "summary_hash": "347a45775b10", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:25:45+00:00"}
