{"summary": "This module implements a Python wrapper around a custom BWA‑aln interactive executable. It keeps the aligner process alive, streams sequencing reads to it, parses the SAM output, and returns structured alignment information. The provided classes represent reads, individual alignment hits, and overall results, and expose methods to align a single read or a batch of reads efficiently against a reference genome.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, low‑overhead alignment of short DNA queries for off‑target detection and other genomic analyses by reusing a persistent BWA‑aln process and delivering results in a program‑friendly format.", "keywords": ["BWA", "alignment", "interactive", "genomics", "off‑target", "read mapping", "SAM", "reference genome", "wrapper", "streaming", "batch processing"], "summary_hash": "4d13becdc41d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:12:28+00:00"}
