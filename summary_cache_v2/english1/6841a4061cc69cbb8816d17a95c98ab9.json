{"summary": "This module sets up a performance benchmark for a relational graph convolutional network applied to entity classification on a homogeneous graph that lacks explicit node features. It constructs learnable node embeddings, configures the RGCN layers, runs training iterations, and records timing information to evaluate speed.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to measure and compare the computational efficiency of RGCN models, aiding in hardware selection, optimization decisions, and algorithmic improvements for graph neural network workloads.", "keywords": ["RGCN", "relational graph convolution", "benchmark", "entity classification", "homogeneous graph", "node embedding", "performance measurement", "speed test", "DGL", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "178212d5d55f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:03:36+00:00"}
