{"summary": "The module provides a step‑by‑step tutorial for training a multi‑layer GraphSAGE model to perform link prediction on the large OGBN‑Arxiv graph. It demonstrates stochastic neighbor sampling, model definition with a dot‑product predictor, loss computation, and evaluation, all using DGL and PyTorch on a single GPU.", "business_intent": "Educate users on how to efficiently train large‑scale graph neural networks for link prediction tasks using neighbor sampling and stochastic training techniques.", "keywords": ["Graph Neural Network", "GraphSAGE", "link prediction", "neighbor sampling", "stochastic training", "large‑scale graph", "OGB", "DGL", "PyTorch", "GPU"], "summary_hash": "21da1e8a333d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:58:32+00:00"}
