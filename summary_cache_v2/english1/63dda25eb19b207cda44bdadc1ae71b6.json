{"summary": "Utility module that supplies helper functions and data structures for the VF2‑based layout passes in Qiskit’s transpiler. It builds interaction and coupling graphs, creates edge and bit lists, computes average error maps, scores candidate layouts, shuffles coupling graphs, and provides a simple DAG visitor used by the VF2 subgraph‑isomorphism algorithm that maps logical qubits to physical qubits.", "business_intent": "Enable the transpiler to automatically find high‑quality qubit placements by leveraging VF2 graph‑matching techniques, taking hardware connectivity and error characteristics into account, thereby improving circuit execution fidelity on quantum devices.", "keywords": ["VF2", "layout optimization", "graph utilities", "error map", "coupling graph", "subgraph isomorphism", "quantum circuit mapping", "DAG traversal", "Rustworkx", "Qiskit transpiler"], "summary_hash": "8692e1eb6ac1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:29:39+00:00"}
