{"summary": "We need to output JSON for the whole module? The prompt says: \"Given file-level metadata and function summaries, output ONLY a JSON object with keys: `summary`, `business_intent`, `keywords` (list).\" It seems we need to produce for the entire directory? The context includes many file summaries. The instruction: \"Given file-level metadata and function summaries, output ONLY a JSON object with keys: `summary`, `business_intent`, `keywords` (list).\" So we need to produce a summary for the whole module path: nemo/collections/nlp/models/language_modeling. So we need to summarize the responsibility of the whole directory (language_modeling collection). Provide business intent and keywords.\n\nThus we need to synthesize across all files: They define various Megatron-based language modeling models (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.), including base classes, adapters, prompt learning, retrieval, fine-tuning, GLUE, etc. Provide utilities for training, validation, inference, generation, metrics, distributed training, model parallelism, etc.\n\nSo summary: The module provides a comprehensive suite of Megatron-powered language modeling components within NeMo, covering base models, adapters, prompt learning, retrieval-augmented models, fine-tuning, instruction tuning, and various task-specific wrappers, handling tokenization, dataset preparation, distributed training, mixed precision, model parallelism, evaluation metrics, and export.\n\nBusiness intent: Enable researchers and developers to efficiently build, pretrain, fine-tune, and deploy large-scale transformer language models (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.) using Megatron parallelism within the NeMo framework, supporting a wide range of NLP tasks such as generation, classification, retrieval, instruction following, and prompt-based learning.\n\nKeywords: Megatron, NeMo, language modeling, BERT, GPT, T5, transformer, distributed training, model parallelism, mixed precision, adapters, prompt learning, retrieval-augmented, fine-tuning, instruction tuning, GLUE, metrics, text generation, ONNX export, GPU acceleration.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nMake sure to start with {{ and end with }} as per example.
