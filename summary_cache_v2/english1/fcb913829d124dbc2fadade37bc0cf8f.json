{"summary": "The class simulates schistosomiasis infection in a population, tracking acquisition, maturation, and longevity of worm burdens for two species, translating worm load into symptom severity and associated disability weights, and applying individual or mass drug administration treatments that clear infections. It loads calibrated parameters, registers disease symptoms, schedules intervention events, and computes total disability-adjusted life‑year impacts.", "business_intent": "Enable health‑policy analysts and researchers to model the epidemiological and economic outcomes of schistosomiasis control strategies, assess disability burden, and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment programs such as praziquantel distribution.", "keywords": ["schistosomiasis", "worm burden", "infection dynamics", "disability weight", "DALY", "praziquantel", "mass drug administration", "simulation", "epidemiology", "health economics"], "summary_hash": "d966186eed17", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:33:02+00:00"}
