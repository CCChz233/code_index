{"summary": "The package implements a complete Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) framework. It defines genotype representations, node abstractions, and primitive operations, and provides mechanisms for creating, mutating, and evaluating populations of individuals. High‑level APIs orchestrate Mu+Lambda evolution, while utilities support backend‑agnostic execution (NumPy, PyTorch, SymPy) and caching of intermediate results.", "business_intent": "Enable automated design and optimization of computational graphs for tasks such as symbolic regression, program synthesis, and neural architecture search, offering a flexible, reusable evolutionary engine that can be integrated into data‑science and AI pipelines.", "keywords": ["Cartesian Genetic Programming", "evolutionary algorithm", "genotype", "phenotype", "population", "mutation", "selection", "computational graph", "backend agnostic", "NumPy", "PyTorch", "SymPy", "primitives", "memoization"], "summary_hash": "c706e80821f3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:46:20+00:00"}
