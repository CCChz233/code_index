{"summary": "The module provides a complete example for fine‑tuning a Stable Diffusion text‑to‑image model using ONNX Runtime’s training capabilities together with the Accelerate library. It handles argument parsing, dataset loading, image preprocessing, caption tokenisation, data collation, model construction (auto‑encoder, UNet, text encoder), training loop with optimizer, learning‑rate scheduling, EMA, checkpointing, validation image generation, and optional export of the trained model to ONNX for downstream inference.", "business_intent": "Showcase how to adapt a pre‑trained diffusion model to custom image generation tasks while leveraging ONNX Runtime for performance‑optimized training and easy deployment, enabling enterprises to build proprietary text‑to‑image solutions with reduced hardware costs.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion", "text-to-image", "diffusion model", "ONNX Runtime", "training", "Accelerate", "fine‑tuning", "dataset preprocessing", "caption tokenisation", "EMA", "checkpointing", "model export", "FP16 optimizer"], "summary_hash": "8e4c493ba856", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:08:07+00:00"}
