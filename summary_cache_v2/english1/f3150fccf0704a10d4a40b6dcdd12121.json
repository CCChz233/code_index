{"summary": "The module provides a reference implementation of the GeniePath graph neural network using DGL and PyTorch, including the core model definition and example scripts that train and evaluate the model on the Pubmed citation network (transductive) and the Protein‑Protein Interaction dataset (inductive). It showcases both eager and lazy propagation variants, handles data loading, model configuration, optimization, and reports classification metrics.", "business_intent": "Offer developers and researchers a ready‑to‑run example for applying the GeniePath GNN architecture to real‑world graph datasets, facilitating benchmarking, learning, and integration of adaptive receptive path techniques within DGL‑based pipelines.", "keywords": ["GeniePath", "graph neural network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "node classification", "Pubmed dataset", "PPI dataset", "transductive learning", "inductive learning", "lazy propagation", "graph convolution"], "summary_hash": "95878df04825", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:53:27+00:00"}
