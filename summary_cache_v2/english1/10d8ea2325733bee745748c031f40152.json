{"summary": "The module contains unit tests that validate the checkpointing and restoration mechanisms of PyTorch Lightning models. It provides helper classes to capture callbacks, simulate exception handling, and implement simple models with validation and test loss logic. The tests cover scenarios such as verifying callback references, checkpoint state integrity, correct step and epoch tracking, repeated fitting, loading models from checkpoints, pickling models, handling trainer property parity, warning on mid‑epoch resume, strict loading with mismatched parameters, and behavior when resuming from non‑existent checkpoints.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that model persistence and resume capabilities work reliably in production machine‑learning workflows, ensuring that saved models can be accurately reloaded, training can be continued without errors, and configuration consistency is maintained across training sessions.", "keywords": ["PyTorch Lightning", "model checkpoint", "restore", "training resume", "callbacks", "validation loss", "test loss", "strict loading", "trainer properties", "unit tests", "model serialization", "exception handling"], "summary_hash": "e8c609937ad4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:41:02+00:00"}
