{"summary": "Provides a drop‑in output projection layer that maps model hidden dimensions to vocabulary logits, applying μP scaling with a 1/width multiplier and constant‑variance initialization for weights and biases. Supports optional model‑parallel distribution of logits.", "business_intent": "Enable stable and correctly scaled output layers for large language models, especially in distributed training environments, by handling parameter scaling and parallel output logistics automatically.", "keywords": ["output projection", "linear layer", "μP scaling", "constant variance initialization", "model parallelism", "vocab logits", "distributed output"], "summary_hash": "b779ed7917b4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:52:27+00:00"}
