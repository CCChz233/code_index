{"summary": "The module implements a hypergraph neural network example using DGL and PyTorch. It loads the Cora citation dataset, constructs a hypergraph incidence matrix with sparse tensors, defines a two‑layer HGNN model, and provides training and evaluation routines for node classification.", "business_intent": "Provide a reference implementation that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a hypergraph neural network on a standard benchmark, helping researchers and developers explore hypergraph‑based deep learning for graph representation tasks.", "keywords": ["hypergraph neural network", "HGNN", "DGL", "PyTorch", "node classification", "Cora dataset", "sparse tensors", "graph learning", "deep learning", "message passing"], "summary_hash": "30875a1a4f4d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:08:43+00:00"}
