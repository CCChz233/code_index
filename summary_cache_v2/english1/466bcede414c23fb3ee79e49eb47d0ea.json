{"summary": "This module implements a custom loss mechanism designed for models that adaptively choose transformer layers, together with helper decorators that wrap transformer models to cache each layer's embeddings and optionally return a specific layer's cached representation during forward passes.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient training and experimentation with sentence embedding models that require dynamic layer selection, reducing redundant computation and supporting advanced loss strategies for improved representation quality.", "keywords": ["adaptive layer loss", "transformer caching", "layer-wise embeddings", "sentence embeddings", "PyTorch loss function", "efficient forward pass", "multiple negatives ranking", "GIST embedding", "model training optimization"], "summary_hash": "0f367600ae89", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:53:22+00:00"}
