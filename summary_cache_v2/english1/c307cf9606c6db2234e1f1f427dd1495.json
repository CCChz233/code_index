{"summary": "The module implements a utility for performing test‑time augmentation during model inference. It repeatedly applies a collection of invertible (including random) spatial transforms to input images, runs the model on each augmented batch, reverses the transforms on the outputs, and then aggregates the predictions to produce statistical summaries such as mode, mean, standard deviation, and variance‑of‑confidence, with an option to return the full set of stacked predictions.", "business_intent": "Enable more accurate and reliable predictions in medical imaging workflows by leveraging test‑time augmentation to reduce model variance, provide uncertainty estimates, and improve overall inference robustness without modifying the trained model.", "keywords": ["test-time augmentation", "inference", "invertible transforms", "prediction aggregation", "statistical summary", "mode", "mean", "standard deviation", "variance of confidence", "batch processing", "MONAI", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "fc2694f563e2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:11:10+00:00"}
