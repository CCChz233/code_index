{"summary": "This module implements utilities for Sparse-Dense-Dense Matrix Multiplication (SDDMM) within the Deep Graph Library. It provides mechanisms to generate and register backend-specific SDDMM kernels, handle data copying between edge and node tensors, and support both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph structures.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑performance graph neural network computations by offering optimized SDDMM operations that combine edge and node features across different hardware backends.", "keywords": ["SDDMM", "sparse-dense-dense multiplication", "graph neural network", "DGL", "backend integration", "heterogeneous graph", "edge feature", "node feature", "kernel registration", "GPU acceleration"], "summary_hash": "4d0d289e32b3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:41:16+00:00"}
