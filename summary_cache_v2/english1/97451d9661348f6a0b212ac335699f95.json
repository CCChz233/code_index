{"summary": "Implements a RoBERTa-specific tokenizer that extends a GPT‑2 style byte‑level BPE tokenizer. It loads a vocabulary and merge rules, tokenizes input text while treating leading spaces as part of tokens, optionally adds a prefix space, and provides utilities for converting between tokens and IDs, handling special tokens, and preparing inputs for RoBERTa models.", "business_intent": "Prepare raw text for consumption by RoBERTa language models by converting it into token IDs and associated metadata, supporting special token insertion, padding, masking, and configurable handling of word boundaries.", "keywords": ["RoBERTa", "tokenizer", "byte‑pair encoding", "BPE", "vocabulary", "special tokens", "prefix space", "text preprocessing", "NLP", "language model"], "summary_hash": "4f1f5f14d74a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:40:29+00:00"}
