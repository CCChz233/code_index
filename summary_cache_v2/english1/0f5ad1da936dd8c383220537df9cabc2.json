{"summary": "Defines a generic base class for diffusion schedulers that loads and stores beta, alpha, and cumulative alpha sequences from a configurable noise schedule, registers custom schedules via MONAI's component store, and provides utilities for adding noise to data and computing velocity terms. Includes simple helper routines for generating common beta schedules (cosine, linear, scaled linear, sigmoid).", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and reusable diffusion scheduling within MONAI's medical imaging pipelines, allowing developers to plug in custom noise schedules and leverage built‑in noise injection and velocity computation for training and inference of diffusion models.", "keywords": ["diffusion scheduler", "noise schedule", "beta schedule", "alpha values", "cumulative alpha", "component registration", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "PyTorch", "noise injection", "velocity calculation"], "summary_hash": "ebc5e127a528", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:20:00+00:00"}
