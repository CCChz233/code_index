{"summary": "Utility module that implements graph‑based hierarchical clustering operations derived from a density‑peak algorithm. It provides functions to compute distances, convert peak detections into graph edges, build successive graph levels, generate tree structures, and supply simple DGL message‑passing helpers.", "business_intent": "Support the creation of hierarchical cluster trees from density‑peak detections within PyTorch workflows, enabling downstream graph‑based analysis or representation learning.", "keywords": ["hierarchical clustering", "density peaks", "graph construction", "DGL", "PyTorch", "tree generation", "edge distances", "message passing"], "summary_hash": "4b7939807057", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:26:48+00:00"}
