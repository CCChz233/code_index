{"summary": "This module implements utilities for sequence‑parallel matrix multiplication in transformer models. It provides forward and backward helpers that coordinate tiled matrix multiplications with distributed collective operations such as all‑gather, reduce‑scatter, and fused kernels, enabling the splitting of the sequence dimension across multiple processes.", "business_intent": "Facilitate scalable training of large language models by distributing the sequence dimension, reducing per‑GPU memory and compute load, and improving throughput through fused distributed operations.", "keywords": ["sequence parallelism", "distributed matrix multiplication", "tiled matmul", "all‑gather", "reduce‑scatter", "fused kernels", "PyTorch", "large language model training", "memory efficiency", "high‑performance computing"], "summary_hash": "fcdea102798b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:29:32+00:00"}
