{"summary": "A configuration container that holds all hyperparameters defining the architecture and behavior of an ImageGPT transformer model, such as vocabulary size, sequence length, embedding dimensions, layer counts, attention heads, dropout rates, activation functions, and initialization settings. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class, allowing seamless model instantiation and output control.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with a flexible, reproducible way to specify and manage ImageGPT model architectures for image generation or representation tasks, enabling easy experimentation, deployment, and integration within machine‑learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["configuration", "ImageGPT", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "sequence length", "embedding dimension", "layer count", "attention heads", "dropout", "activation function", "initialization", "attention scaling", "cache", "model instantiation"], "summary_hash": "104484a5c048", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:17:34+00:00"}
