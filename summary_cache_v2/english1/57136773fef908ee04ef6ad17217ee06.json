{"summary": "Provides a mechanism to execute code blocks atomically by managing database transactions and savepoints, usable both as a decorator and a context manager. It creates a transaction or a savepoint on entry, commits or releases on successful exit, and rolls back on errors, supporting reentrancy and optional savepoint suppression while being thread‑local safe.", "business_intent": "Simplify and guarantee atomicity of database operations, ensuring consistent commit/rollback behavior without manual transaction handling.", "keywords": ["atomic execution", "transaction management", "savepoint", "context manager", "decorator", "thread‑local", "reentrancy", "rollback", "commit", "database"], "summary_hash": "fe277d33b82b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:11:42+00:00"}
