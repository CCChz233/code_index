{"summary": "This module supplies a suite of custom PyTorch Lightning components—strategies, plugins, data fetchers, progress bars, gradient scalers, and checkpoint connectors—tailored for Megatron‑core model‑parallel NLP training. It adapts distributed data parallel, fully‑sharded data parallel, and pipeline parallel execution to handle mixed‑precision autocasting, gradient overflow detection, and efficient checkpointing across tensor‑parallel ranks.", "business_intent": "To enable large‑scale, high‑performance training and inference of state‑of‑the‑art NLP models by providing seamless integration of model‑parallel techniques with Lightning's training loop, reducing engineering effort and improving scalability, reliability, and resource utilization.", "keywords": ["model parallel", "Megatron", "NLP", "PyTorch Lightning", "distributed training", "mixed precision", "gradient scaling", "checkpointing", "data fetching", "FSDP", "DDP", "pipeline parallel"], "summary_hash": "eb5d85b98ffc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:19:39+00:00"}
