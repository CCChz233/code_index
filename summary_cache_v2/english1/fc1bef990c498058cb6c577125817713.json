{"summary": "Defines a generic workflow abstraction for MONAI bundles and a concrete configuration‑driven implementation. The base class manages workflow type validation, metadata loading, logging setup, and lifecycle hooks (initialize, run, finalize) with property access utilities. The derived class orchestrates the full execution pipeline—adjusting the Python path, parsing bundle configurations, handling experiment management, and invoking the lifecycle methods—enabling consistent training, inference, or evaluation of medical imaging models.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, configurable framework that streamlines the deployment and experimentation of MONAI AI bundles, ensuring reproducible training/inference pipelines, standardized logging, and optional experiment tracking for medical imaging applications.", "keywords": ["MONAI", "bundle", "workflow", "training", "inference", "evaluation", "configuration", "logging", "metadata", "experiment tracking", "Python path", "property access"], "summary_hash": "0a9efaf56d41", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:08:12+00:00"}
