{"summary": "This module sets up an OME-NGFF Zarr hierarchy for CellVoyager multiplexed imaging datasets. It parses file names and Yokogawa metadata, organizes wells and rows/columns, validates channel information, defines OMERO channel specifications, creates plate and well metadata structures, prepares region‑of‑interest tables, and writes necessary metadata tables into a newly created Zarr group, handling overwrites as needed.", "business_intent": "Enable automated conversion of CellVoyager multiplexed microscopy data into the standardized OME-NGFF format within Fractal pipelines, facilitating scalable storage, sharing, and downstream image analysis.", "keywords": ["OME-NGFF", "Zarr", "CellVoyager", "multiplexed imaging", "metadata extraction", "well layout", "channel validation", "ROI tables", "plate schema", "Fractal workflow"], "summary_hash": "2f9c430c0f39", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:57:16+00:00"}
