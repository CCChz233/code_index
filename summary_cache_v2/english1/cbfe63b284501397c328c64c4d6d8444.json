{"summary": "A comprehensive toolkit for preparing and partitioning large graph datasets for distributed training with DGL. It reads raw node/edge files, preprocesses data for ParMETIS, runs the partitioner, post‑processes its output, shuffles and redistributes graph data across processes, assigns global and local identifiers, builds per‑partition DGL graph objects, and supplies lookup and communication utilities for efficient multi‑machine GNN training.", "business_intent": "To streamline and automate the end‑to‑end pipeline required to scale graph neural network training across multiple machines by handling graph partitioning, data shuffling, ID management, and distributed lookup, thereby reducing engineering effort and enabling high‑performance distributed GNN workloads.", "keywords": ["distributed graph partitioning", "DGL", "graph neural networks", "ParMETIS", "data shuffling", "global ID assignment", "lookup service", "collective communication", "multi‑process", "feature handling"], "summary_hash": "c4844f79af1c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:47:37+00:00"}
