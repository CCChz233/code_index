{"summary": "A command‑line tool that transforms multimodal instruction datasets (text JSON and images) into a packed, indexed format suitable for training NeMo multimodal language models. It tokenizes text, encodes images with a vision encoder, applies a configurable sequence‑packing algorithm to keep tokens and image embeddings within a maximum length, and writes the processed data to an indexed dataset directory.", "business_intent": "Streamline and optimize the data preparation pipeline for multimodal language model training, enabling efficient sequence packing and reduced padding to improve training speed and resource utilization.", "keywords": ["multimodal preprocessing", "sequence packing", "tokenization", "image encoding", "vision encoder", "NeMo", "indexed dataset", "command-line utility", "training data preparation"], "summary_hash": "9d81653d6a84", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:56:29+00:00"}
