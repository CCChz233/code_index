{"summary": "Implements a PyTorch Lightning workflow for node classification using a GraphSAGE model on the Open Graph Benchmark dataset. It defines a data module to load and batch graph data and a Lightning module that builds the GraphSAGE network, handles forward passes, loss computation, optimizer configuration, and training/validation steps with accuracy metrics and checkpointing.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, high‑level example that lets data scientists and engineers quickly prototype and scale graph neural network training for node property prediction tasks, leveraging DGL and Lightning to simplify data handling, model management, and experiment tracking.", "keywords": ["GraphSAGE", "PyTorch Lightning", "node classification", "DGL", "Open Graph Benchmark", "data module", "training loop", "model checkpoint", "accuracy metric", "graph neural network"], "summary_hash": "0b6114294ed0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:32:49+00:00"}
