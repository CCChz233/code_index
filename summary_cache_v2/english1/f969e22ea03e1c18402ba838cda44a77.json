{"summary": "This module implements a neural‑network based ensemble backend for ANNIF. It stores training samples in an LMDB database, provides a Keras sequence wrapper for efficient data loading, defines a custom layer that averages tensors, and orchestrates the construction, training, and prediction of multiple neural network models whose outputs are combined to produce unified suggestion results.", "business_intent": "To improve automatic subject indexing or recommendation quality by leveraging the collective strengths of several neural network models, enabling more accurate and robust predictions across different projects.", "keywords": ["neural network", "ensemble", "backend", "ANNIF", "Keras", "LMDB", "data sequence", "mean layer", "model aggregation", "training", "prediction", "subject suggestion", "classification"], "summary_hash": "3fc2945a85d7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:35:13+00:00"}
