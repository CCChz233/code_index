{"summary": "NeptuneLogger integrates the Neptune experiment‑tracking service with PyTorch Lightning, creating or using a Neptune run and exposing a logger that records training metrics, hyperparameters, model summaries, checkpoints, and arbitrary artifacts such as files or images. It handles initialization parameters like API token, project, run name, tags, and a configurable root namespace, and provides serialization support for checkpointing.", "business_intent": "Provide a seamless way for Lightning users to capture and store all training information in Neptune, facilitating reproducibility, monitoring, and collaboration on machine‑learning experiments.", "keywords": ["neptune", "experiment tracking", "pytorch lightning", "logger", "metrics", "hyperparameters", "model checkpoints", "metadata", "run management", "integration"], "summary_hash": "7a6cfc46ad09", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:16:08+00:00"}
