{"summary": "Implements a utility that loads NeMo language model checkpoints with the required parallel configuration, runs post‑training quantization by calibrating activations to compute scaling factors, and exports the resulting low‑precision model weights and configuration either as a directory structure or a single .qnemo package ready for TensorRT‑LLM inference.", "business_intent": "Provide a streamlined workflow for compressing and preparing NeMo language models for high‑performance, low‑latency deployment on GPU inference platforms, reducing storage and compute costs while maintaining accuracy.", "keywords": ["quantization", "NeMo", "language model", "checkpoint loading", "parallelism", "post‑training calibration", "scaling factors", "low‑precision weights", "model export", ".qnemo", "TensorRT‑LLM", "inference optimization"], "summary_hash": "6e2d6796a563", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:11:58+00:00"}
