{"summary": "This module implements a collection of lazy array construction utilities for Dask, offering NumPy‑compatible functions to generate arrays (e.g., ranges, linspaces, identity matrices, diagonals, tiled patterns) and to manipulate array shapes (padding, repeating, broadcasting). It handles chunk computation, metadata extraction, and backend dispatch, building high‑level graphs that enable parallel, out‑of‑core execution.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, parallel creation and transformation of large arrays without materializing them in memory, supporting familiar NumPy‑style APIs while integrating with Dask's chunked computation model.", "keywords": ["dask", "array creation", "lazy evaluation", "chunking", "numpy compatibility", "high‑level graph", "parallel computation", "backend dispatch", "padding", "broadcasting", "identity matrix", "range generation"], "summary_hash": "c5a0b8798612", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:18:03+00:00"}
