{"summary": "This module implements a scheduler for denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) with parallel execution capabilities. It defines the core scheduling logic, including beta schedule handling, timestep spacing, variance calculation, sample clipping, dynamic thresholding, and input scaling, and provides a lightweight output container for the results of each diffusion step.", "business_intent": "Enable fast and memory‑efficient inference of diffusion‑based generative models by offering a parallelizable DDIM scheduler, thereby accelerating image or latent generation pipelines in AI applications.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "DDIM", "parallel scheduler", "inference", "beta schedule", "variance", "clipping", "dynamic thresholding", "input scaling", "latent generation", "torch", "numpy", "configuration"], "summary_hash": "6ce995ed545d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:14:18+00:00"}
