{"summary": "The module supplies PyTorch Lightning callbacks that enhance training workflows: one records the duration of each epoch for logging purposes, while another implements an exponential moving average (EMA) system that maintains shadow model weights, swaps them during evaluation and inference, and integrates with checkpointing and optimizer steps.", "business_intent": "To improve model training observability and stability, enabling precise epoch timing for performance monitoring and leveraging EMA to achieve better generalization and smoother inference, thereby supporting robust, production‑ready AI model development.", "keywords": ["PyTorch Lightning", "callback", "epoch timing", "logging", "exponential moving average", "EMA", "model weight averaging", "validation", "testing", "inference", "checkpoint integration", "optimizer wrapper", "training stability"], "summary_hash": "da2612a1bf10", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:01:01+00:00"}
