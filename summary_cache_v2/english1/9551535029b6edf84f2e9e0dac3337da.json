{"summary": "Implements a self‑supervised audio representation model using the Data2Vec architecture. It encodes raw audio, applies masking to hidden states, performs a forward pass to generate embeddings, and offers the ability to freeze the feature encoder for downstream fine‑tuning.", "business_intent": "Supply a versatile pretrained audio encoder that can be fine‑tuned for speech, audio classification, or acoustic event detection tasks, lowering the data labeling burden and accelerating model development.", "keywords": ["audio", "self-supervised", "Data2Vec", "representation learning", "masking", "feature encoder", "freeze", "forward pass", "neural network", "pretrained model", "fine‑tuning"], "summary_hash": "8533b5c9335f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:19:13+00:00"}
