{"summary": "A configuration container that holds all architectural hyperparameters for a RoBERTa transformer model, such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, dropout rates, and position‑embedding settings. It inherits from a generic pretrained‑model config and is used to create or modify RoBERTa encoder/decoder instances.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to easily specify, customize, and reproduce the exact architecture of RoBERTa models for natural‑language‑processing applications, facilitating model initialization, fine‑tuning, and integration with pretrained weights.", "keywords": ["RoBERTa", "configuration", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "dropout", "position embeddings", "decoder", "cache", "classifier dropout", "PretrainedConfig"], "summary_hash": "083f354020db", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:42:29+00:00"}
