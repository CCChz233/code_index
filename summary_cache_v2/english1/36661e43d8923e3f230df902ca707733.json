{"summary": "Defines a comprehensive Stable Diffusion XL pipeline that transforms textual prompts into high‑resolution images. It orchestrates CLIP text encoders, a conditional UNet, a VAE decoder, and a scheduler, handling prompt tokenization, latent preparation, denoising with classifier‑free guidance, and optional watermarking, while also providing utility helpers for noise scaling and timestep extraction.", "business_intent": "Offer developers and creators an out‑of‑the‑box, extensible solution for generating photorealistic images from natural language, supporting advanced features such as negative prompts, custom schedulers, and fine‑tuning extensions.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion XL", "text‑to‑image generation", "diffusion pipeline", "CLIP encoders", "UNet denoiser", "VAE decoder", "scheduler", "classifier‑free guidance", "watermarking", "noise scaling", "timestep handling"], "summary_hash": "9547a263632f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:23:42+00:00"}
