{"summary": "This module implements a callback that watches a chosen training or validation metric during a PyTorch Lightning run and automatically terminates the training loop when the metric stops improving. It offers configurable behavior such as minimum change thresholds, patience counters, mode selection (minimize or maximize), finite‑value checks, and absolute thresholds, while handling metric validation, logging, and state persistence across sessions.", "business_intent": "Enable users to automatically stop model training once performance plateaus, thereby avoiding over‑fitting and saving computational resources without manual intervention.", "keywords": ["early stopping", "callback", "metric monitoring", "patience", "minimum delta", "training termination", "PyTorch Lightning", "validation metric", "state checkpoint", "logging", "minimize mode", "maximize mode"], "summary_hash": "fdcdb9022069", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:55:13+00:00"}
