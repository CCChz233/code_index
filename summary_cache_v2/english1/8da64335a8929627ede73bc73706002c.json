{"summary": "A configurable 2‑D UNet architecture for conditional audio diffusion models. It accepts a noisy latent sample, timestep embeddings, and up to two conditioning embeddings, applying optional self‑attention and multiple cross‑attention layers across down‑, middle‑ and up‑sampling blocks to generate a denoised output.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible neural network module that can be integrated into audio generation pipelines using diffusion techniques, offering customizable attention mechanisms and conditioning options to improve synthesis quality and adaptability.", "keywords": ["UNet", "audio diffusion", "conditional generation", "cross‑attention", "self‑attention", "transformer blocks", "time embedding", "latent denoising", "configurable architecture", "generative audio model"], "summary_hash": "422784dca596", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:18:18+00:00"}
