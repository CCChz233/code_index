{"summary": "The module provides utilities to embed visual watermarks into images produced by the Stable Diffusion XL model. It defines watermark data constants, checks for invisible watermark support, and implements a class that prepares and overlays watermark graphics using NumPy and PyTorch tensors.", "business_intent": "To enable attribution and detection of AI‑generated images, protecting intellectual property and supporting compliance with usage policies for Stable Diffusion XL outputs.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion xl", "watermark", "visual watermark", "image embedding", "invisible watermark", "torch", "numpy", "AI‑generated content", "attribution", "image processing"], "summary_hash": "9f3b190538ba", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:23:34+00:00"}
