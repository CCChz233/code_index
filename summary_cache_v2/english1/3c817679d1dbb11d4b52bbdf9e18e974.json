{"summary": "The module defines a collection of pytest test cases intended to exercise MODFLOW‑6 grid operations—specifically clipping and regridding—when lake features are present across various model scopes (model, package, simulation). It also includes a small utility to generate a finer resolution grid for use in those tests. Currently the tests are not invoked by the test suite and appear to be dead code.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the MF6 modeling framework correctly handles (or rejects) unsupported grid manipulation scenarios involving lakes, thereby safeguarding model integrity and providing clear feedback to users when such operations are attempted.", "keywords": ["testing", "MODFLOW 6", "grid clipping", "grid regridding", "lakes", "unsupported operations", "dead code", "helper function", "finer grid", "pytest", "xarray", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "82fbeeca9076", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:53:44+00:00"}
