{"summary": "This module provides a suite of utility functions for accessing and computing fundamental atomic and isotopic information. It can determine properties such as atomic number, mass number, charge state, electric charge, isotopic abundance, half‑life, reduced mass, and standard atomic weight. It also offers helpers to retrieve known or stable isotopes of an element and to obtain periodic‑table classifications like block, group, period, and category. The functions accept various particle representations and raise specific errors for invalid inputs.", "business_intent": "Supply reliable atomic data and calculations to support plasma‑physics and particle‑modeling workflows within the larger library, facilitating accurate simulations, diagnostics, and analyses of plasmas.", "keywords": ["atomic number", "mass number", "charge", "electric charge", "isotopic abundance", "half-life", "reduced mass", "standard atomic weight", "isotopes", "periodic table", "plasma physics", "particle data", "validation"], "summary_hash": "7c7fcd593df3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:04:52+00:00"}
