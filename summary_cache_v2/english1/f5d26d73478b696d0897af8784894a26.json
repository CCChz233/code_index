{"summary": "GreedyCTCInfer implements a fast, greedy connectionist temporal classification decoder that converts model log‑probabilities into token sequences, handling both single samples and batches. It manages the blank token, optionally retains alignment histories, computes per‑token timestamps, and can generate per‑frame confidence scores using configurable methods such as maximum probability or various entropy measures.", "business_intent": "Provide an efficient decoding component for speech or sequence models that produces transcriptions with optional timing and confidence information, enabling real‑time transcription, downstream analytics, and quality assessment.", "keywords": ["greedy decoding", "CTC", "blank token", "timestamps", "confidence scoring", "entropy", "batch processing", "speech recognition", "hypothesis", "alignment preservation"], "summary_hash": "6b47645a3286", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:32:06+00:00"}
