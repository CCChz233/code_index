{"summary": "The module offers a collection of low‑level, performance‑oriented utilities for working with Git tree objects. It includes helpers for constructing full file paths, converting raw tree data into entry structures, recursively walking tree hierarchies, and streaming tree representations. The functions are designed to be as fast as possible, though many are currently unused within the codebase.", "business_intent": "Enable fast processing and serialization of Git repository tree structures, supporting high‑performance operations such as path resolution, tree entry extraction, and recursive traversal for tools that need efficient access to Git object data.", "keywords": ["git", "tree objects", "fast utilities", "path handling", "recursive traversal", "serialization", "performance", "low-level", "object processing", "streaming"], "summary_hash": "7ac7e2d640a3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:46:44+00:00"}
