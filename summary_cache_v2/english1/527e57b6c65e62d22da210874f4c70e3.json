{"summary": "This module defines a unittest class that exercises MONAI's LearningRateFinder using a small MedNIST dataset and a DenseNet model. It sets up deterministic data loading, applies standard preprocessing transforms, runs the LR finder, and asserts that the returned learning rates and loss values meet expected criteria.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and stability of the learning rate finder utility to support reliable hyperparameter tuning in medical imaging deep learning workflows.", "keywords": ["unit test", "learning rate finder", "MONAI", "MedNIST", "DenseNet", "deterministic", "hyperparameter tuning", "torch", "data loader", "transforms"], "summary_hash": "600a3ba8a99d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:46:42+00:00"}
