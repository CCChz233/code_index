{"summary": "Provides a transform that extracts a configurable number of random sub‑volumes of a given spatial size from an image, where the crop centre is chosen from pixels belonging to each label class according to user‑defined ratios. Supports one‑hot or argmax label maps, optional image‑based masking, automatic handling of borders and dimensions larger than the source, optional size reduction, and lazy execution.", "business_intent": "Enable class‑balanced patch sampling for training deep learning models, especially in segmentation tasks, by generating random crops that respect class distribution and image boundaries, improving model robustness and reducing class imbalance.", "keywords": ["random cropping", "class‑balanced sampling", "spatial size", "label ratios", "one‑hot", "argmax", "image augmentation", "lazy execution", "ROI adjustment", "data preprocessing", "segmentation"], "summary_hash": "958a90cd6e4c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:03:37+00:00"}
