{"summary": "The module showcases a complete workflow for training and evaluating a Scalable Inception Graph Neural Network (SIGN) on large‑scale graph datasets. It includes utilities to load graph data, convert it into PyTorch tensors, define a simple feed‑forward network wrapped as a graph model, and run training and testing loops, serving as a reference implementation for node classification tasks.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with a ready‑to‑run example that reproduces SIGN results on benchmark datasets, facilitating adoption of the method and enabling quick experimentation with scalable GNN architectures in production or research pipelines.", "keywords": ["SIGN", "graph neural network", "PyTorch", "DGL", "node classification", "large-scale graphs", "dataset preprocessing", "benchmark", "Amazon products", "Reddit"], "summary_hash": "b79515911db1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:53:37+00:00"}
