{"summary": "A mock implementation of AWS Secrets Manager that defines custom error types, core data models with versioning, replication, rotation, policies, and tagging, and a backend that handles creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of secrets. It also includes utilities for parsing ARNs, generating passwords, and constructing secret identifiers, plus response wrappers that translate backend actions into HTTP responses for testing purposes.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to simulate the Secrets Manager service locally for unit testing, development, and CI/CD pipelines without contacting the real AWS infrastructure.", "keywords": ["AWS", "Secrets Manager", "mock", "testing", "unit tests", "CI/CD", "secret versioning", "replication", "rotation", "policy enforcement", "tagging", "ARN parsing", "password generation", "backend", "HTTP response wrapper"], "summary_hash": "7fd54343236d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:54:51+00:00"}
