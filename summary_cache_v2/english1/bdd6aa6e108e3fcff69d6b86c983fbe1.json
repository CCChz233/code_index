{"summary": "Implements a SentencePiece‑based tokenizer tailored for T5 models. It loads a .spm vocabulary, manages special tokens (eos, unk, pad, extra sentinel tokens), optionally adds a leading space, and provides conversion between raw strings, subword tokens, and integer IDs. The class also builds model inputs with the correct special token layout, generates token‑type IDs and special‑token masks, and supports a legacy mode for handling tokens after special symbols.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable preprocessing component that transforms user text into the token format required by T5 encoder‑decoder architectures, facilitating downstream NLP applications such as translation, summarization, and text generation within the Hugging Face Transformers ecosystem.", "keywords": ["T5", "SentencePiece", "tokenization", "subword", "vocabulary", "special tokens", "sentinel tokens", "extra ids", "padding", "unknown token", "legacy mode", "text preprocessing", "NLP"], "summary_hash": "8f72283fc77b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:26:30+00:00"}
