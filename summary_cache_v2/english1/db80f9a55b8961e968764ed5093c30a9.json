{"summary": "Implements a multi‑layer transformer decoder that combines textual and visual representations. The decoder builds its depth from a configuration parameter and manages input embeddings, while offering utilities to lock specific parts of the network during training.", "business_intent": "Enable fine‑tuned multimodal generation by providing a configurable decoder that can be partially frozen for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks involving both language and image data.", "keywords": ["transformer", "decoder", "multimodal", "text", "vision", "layer", "configuration", "embeddings", "parameter freezing", "fine‑tuning"], "summary_hash": "38c97fc4472f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:41:45+00:00"}
