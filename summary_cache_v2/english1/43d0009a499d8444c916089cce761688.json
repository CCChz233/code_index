{"summary": "This module implements a distributed relational graph convolutional network for entity classification on multi‑relational graphs. It provides a distributed embedding layer for featureless heterogeneous nodes, a relational graph convolution layer supporting basis decomposition, self‑loops, bias, activation and dropout, and an entity classification model that learns node embeddings and predicts labels. Utility functions handle accuracy computation, embedding initialization, and orchestrate training and evaluation in a distributed DGL environment.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable training and inference of relational GCN models on large heterogeneous graphs by leveraging distributed data loading and parallel computation, facilitating research and production use‑cases that require high‑performance entity classification across many relation types.", "keywords": ["relational graph convolutional network", "entity classification", "distributed training", "DGL", "PyTorch", "heterogeneous graph", "embedding layer", "basis decomposition", "graph neural network", "L2 regularization"], "summary_hash": "664942f325cf", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:33:34+00:00"}
