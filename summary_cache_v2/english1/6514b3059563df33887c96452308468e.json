{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class Stack. Provide summary: a data structure implementing LIFO stack with typical operations push, pop, peek, clear, length. Business intent: to manage collection of items in last-in-first-out order, useful for algorithms, undo functionality, expression evaluation, etc. Keywords: stack, LIFO, push, pop, peek, clear, collection, data structure, container, size.\n\nMake sure not to list method names verbatim? The constraint: \"Do NOT list method names verbatim.\" Means we should avoid directly listing method names like __init__, __len__, clear, peek, pop, push. But we can refer to operations conceptually. So keywords maybe \"LIFO\", \"push operation\", \"pop operation\"? That might be considered method names? Might be okay as generic terms. But to be safe, we can use synonyms: \"add\", \"remove\", \"inspect top\", \"reset\". However keywords list may include \"stack\", \"LIFO\", \"push\", \"pop\", \"peek\", \"clear\". The constraint says not to list method names verbatim. That could be interpreted as not to list the method names exactly as they appear. \"push\" is a method name; maybe we should avoid using \"push\" as a keyword. But \"push operation\" might still be considered verbatim. Safer to avoid method names. Use generic terms: \"add element\", \"remove element\", \"view top element\", \"reset collection\".
