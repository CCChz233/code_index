{"summary": "The class models an N‑qubit Clifford unitary by storing its stabilizer and destabilizer generators in a binary tableau. It offers construction from quantum circuits, Pauli labels, matrices, and permutation specifications, and can be transformed back into circuit, gate, operator, or matrix forms. It supports algebraic operations such as composition, tensoring, conjugation, and adjoint, as well as inspection of individual stabilizer rows and phases.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient representation, manipulation, and conversion of Clifford group elements for quantum‑information algorithms, circuit synthesis, and stabilizer‑based simulation within a quantum computing framework.", "keywords": ["Clifford group", "quantum circuit", "stabilizer tableau", "symplectic matrix", "unitary operator", "tensor product", "composition", "adjoint", "quantum simulation", "gate decomposition"], "summary_hash": "4d0dde6a7be6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:25:15+00:00"}
