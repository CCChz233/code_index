{"summary": "The module defines a command‑line driven workflow for fine‑tuning a sequence‑classification model to predict reward scores. It includes argument handling for hardware configuration, a data collator that pads reward samples, a custom trainer that computes reward‑specific loss, and a callback that evaluates the model after the first training step. Supporting utilities compute evaluation metrics and (unused) preprocessing logic.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to efficiently train reward models for reinforcement learning from human feedback, leveraging parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning (LoRA) and HuggingFace's training ecosystem.", "keywords": ["reward modeling", "fine‑tuning", "LoRA", "HuggingFace Trainer", "data collator", "evaluation callback", "GPU configuration", "sequence classification", "RLHF"], "summary_hash": "55fb58d0355b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:02:25+00:00"}
