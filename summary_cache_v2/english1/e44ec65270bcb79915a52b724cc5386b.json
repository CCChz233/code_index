{"summary": "This script implements a training pipeline for a TreeLSTM model using MXNet and DGL. It loads a tree-structured dataset, prepares word embeddings, constructs data batches, initializes the TreeLSTM network, runs the training loop with loss computation and back‑propagation, evaluates on a development set, and saves the trained model.", "business_intent": "Provide an example of how to train a graph‑based recurrent neural network for natural language tasks such as sentiment analysis, showcasing the integration of MXNet, DGL, and pre‑trained word vectors.", "keywords": ["TreeLSTM", "MXNet", "DGL", "graph neural network", "training pipeline", "sentiment analysis", "word embeddings", "model evaluation", "batch processing", "deep learning example"], "summary_hash": "b55943ff36ef", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:10:22+00:00"}
