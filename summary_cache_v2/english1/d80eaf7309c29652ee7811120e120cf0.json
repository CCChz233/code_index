{"summary": "The package defines the core runtime abstractions and built‑in operations used by DGL for graph neural network computation. It supplies a generic function wrapper that couples compiled kernels with execution metadata for different hardware back‑ends, a collection of standard message‑passing primitives (binary ops, copy semantics, etc.), and the corresponding reduction utilities for aggregating messages.", "business_intent": "Provide a hardware‑independent, high‑performance foundation for implementing and executing GNN kernels, simplifying the development of custom graph algorithms and ensuring consistent behavior across devices.", "keywords": ["DGL", "graph neural networks", "runtime abstraction", "message passing", "aggregation", "reduction", "compiled kernels", "hardware targets", "GNN operations"], "summary_hash": "9a601a375be6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:58:36+00:00"}
