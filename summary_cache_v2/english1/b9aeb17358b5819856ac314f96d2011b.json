{"summary": "Provides a lightweight, placeholder implementation for MIDI processing utilities, allowing the library to operate without the full note_seq backend. It includes a processor class that can be instantiated, configured with custom settings, and used to load pretrained processing pipelines in a dummy fashion.", "business_intent": "Facilitate testing, deployment, and usage of the diffusion library in environments where the note_seq dependency is unavailable by supplying fallback objects that mimic MIDI processing behavior.", "keywords": ["dummy", "MIDI", "processor", "placeholder", "backend", "configuration", "pretrained pipeline", "note_seq", "fallback", "utility"], "summary_hash": "465241b66b21", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:10:48+00:00"}
