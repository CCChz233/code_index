{"summary": "A test suite that validates the behavior of the LightningOptimizer wrapper in PyTorch Lightning. It includes a custom optimizer with hooks to capture inputs and gradients, and a collection of tests that check initialization resetting, hook preservation, access to parameter groups and optimizer state, correct handling of optimizer steps and zero_grad under both automatic and manual optimization modes, and edge cases such as LBFGS and state mutation.", "business_intent": "Ensure the LightningOptimizer abstraction works reliably across different optimizers and training configurations, providing confidence that gradient handling, state management, and optimization steps behave as expected in the Lightning framework.", "keywords": ["LightningOptimizer", "optimizer hooks", "automatic optimization", "manual optimization", "parameter groups", "optimizer state", "zero_grad", "LBFGS", "gradient accumulation", "PyTorch Lightning", "testing"], "summary_hash": "764a7341507b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:38:22+00:00"}
