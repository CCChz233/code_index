{"summary": "A utility script that processes a scene‑graph dataset to compute statistical relationship frequencies (a frequency prior) using MXNet. It parses command‑line options, loads annotation data, calculates bounding‑box overlaps (IoU), filters overlapping pairs, aggregates co‑occurrence counts, and saves the resulting prior model for downstream scene‑graph prediction tasks.", "business_intent": "To enhance image understanding systems by providing a learned prior of object relationships, thereby improving the accuracy of scene‑graph generation and related computer‑vision applications such as visual search, captioning, and autonomous perception.", "keywords": ["scene graph", "frequency prior", "relationship statistics", "bounding box IoU", "MXNet", "data preprocessing", "computer vision", "model training"], "summary_hash": "c26a33b0c633", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:10:29+00:00"}
