{"summary": "Implements a pipeline that transforms a single input image into a short video sequence using the Stable Video Diffusion model. The pipeline encodes the image, prepares latent representations, runs a spatio‑temporal diffusion process with a UNet and scheduler, and decodes the resulting latents back into video frames via a VAE.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to generate dynamic video content from static images, supporting applications in advertising, entertainment, social media, and rapid prototyping of visual media using generative AI.", "keywords": ["video generation", "image-to-video", "stable diffusion", "latent diffusion", "VAE", "CLIP encoder", "UNet", "scheduler", "temporally coherent frames", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "d1c6015a0914", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:40:09+00:00"}
