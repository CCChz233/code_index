{"summary": "This module supplies placeholder (dummy) implementations for a large collection of diffusion‑related models, pipelines, schedulers, and utility classes. The dummy objects mimic the interfaces of the real components but raise informative errors when used, allowing the library to be imported and inspected even when the required deep‑learning backends are unavailable.", "business_intent": "Provide graceful degradation and clear error messaging in environments lacking optional deep‑learning dependencies, enabling the package to be imported safely and improving developer experience by avoiding import‑time failures.", "keywords": ["dummy", "placeholder", "fallback", "model", "pipeline", "scheduler", "diffusion", "transformer", "autoencoder", "controlnet", "backend", "import safety", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "d4839c0dcffb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:09:54+00:00"}
