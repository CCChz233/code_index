{"summary": "A configuration container that holds all architectural hyperparameters for an MPNet model, such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, dropout rates, position embedding limits, and initialization settings. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate MPNetModel or TFMPNetModel instances with the desired architecture.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to customize, reproduce, and load MPNet transformer models by specifying model architecture details in a single, serializable object, facilitating seamless model creation and integration within the Transformers library.", "keywords": ["MPNet", "configuration", "transformer", "hidden size", "attention heads", "vocab size", "dropout", "position embeddings", "layer normalization", "relative attention buckets", "pretrained config", "model initialization"], "summary_hash": "4562bf9cde36", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:34:37+00:00"}
