{"summary": "Implements a Lark transformer that converts StarkNet ABI v2 parse trees into concrete Cairo type objects, handling primitive and composite types such as booleans, unsigned integers, byte arrays, contract addresses, options, tuples, and arrays. Includes a convenience parse function that applies the grammar to raw ABI strings.", "business_intent": "Enable automated processing of StarkNet contract ABIs by translating them into internal Cairo type representations for downstream tasks like code generation, type checking, or client library creation.", "keywords": ["Lark", "parser", "transformer", "ABI", "StarkNet", "Cairo", "type conversion", "uint", "bool", "bytes", "contract address", "option", "tuple", "array", "grammar"], "summary_hash": "ce30e0a80eb1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:45:40+00:00"}
