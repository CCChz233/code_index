{"summary": "A configuration container that defines the architecture and hyper‑parameters for a multimodal conditional generation model, combining a vision backbone and a text backbone. It holds settings such as vision and text configs, token indices, loss ignore index, projector activation and normalization, selected vision feature layers, and vocabulary size, which are used to instantiate the model.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to customize and instantiate a multimodal language model by specifying vision and language components and related hyper‑parameters, facilitating flexible deployment of conditional generation tasks that involve both images and text.", "keywords": ["configuration", "multimodal", "vision backbone", "text backbone", "model architecture", "token index", "projector", "layer normalization", "vocabulary size", "ignore index", "pretrained"], "summary_hash": "2caecb943997", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:24:05+00:00"}
