{"summary": "This module provides a comprehensive test suite for the Stable Diffusion XL Instruct‑Pix2Pix pipeline. It constructs lightweight dummy components (autoencoder, UNet, scheduler, tokenizer, text encoder) and feeds synthetic inputs to validate core behaviours such as attention slicing, classifier‑free guidance, correct integration of optional components, consistency between batch and single‑step generation, proper latent processing, and deterministic execution.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and correctness of the instruction‑guided image‑to‑image generation pipeline based on Stable Diffusion XL, so that developers can confidently integrate it into production or research workflows.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion xl", "instruct pix2pix", "pipeline testing", "image‑to‑image generation", "unit tests", "attention slicing", "classifier‑free guidance", "batch inference consistency", "latent handling", "optional components", "deterministic execution", "diffusers", "transformers"], "summary_hash": "7a496836625f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:53:41+00:00"}
