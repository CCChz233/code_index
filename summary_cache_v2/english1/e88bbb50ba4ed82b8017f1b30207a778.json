{"summary": "This module provides a suite of benchmarking utilities for evaluating sequence‑parallel fused transformer operations (feed‑forward and multi‑head attention) on LLaMA models of various sizes. It defines data structures for tracking benchmark steps, helper functions to configure model components, and a collection of routines that measure compute and communication lower bounds as well as fused kernel performance under different execution strategies.", "business_intent": "To quantify and compare the performance characteristics of fused sequence‑parallel transformer kernels, enabling developers to identify bottlenecks, validate theoretical lower bounds, and guide optimization decisions for large‑scale language model deployments.", "keywords": ["benchmarking", "sequence parallelism", "fused kernels", "transformer", "LLaMA", "feed‑forward network", "multi‑head attention", "performance measurement", "PyTorch", "communication lower bound", "compute lower bound", "NCCL", "multiprocessing", "model scaling"], "summary_hash": "90f40682f1eb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:28:39+00:00"}
