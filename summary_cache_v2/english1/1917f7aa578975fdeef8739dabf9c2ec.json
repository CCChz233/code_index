{"summary": "This module implements the core registry layer of the Feast feature‑store SDK. It defines utilities for handling different Feast object types and a Registry class that serves as the single point of interaction for creating, updating, deleting, retrieving and listing metadata objects such as data sources, entities, feature views, on‑demand views, stream views, feature services, permissions and projects. The Registry ensures that the in‑memory repository contents stay consistent with the underlying persistent store and abstracts the storage backend selection based on URL scheme or type.", "business_intent": "Provide a programmatic, centralized API for managing all feature‑store metadata, enabling developers and orchestration tools to keep the registry synchronized across environments and to perform reliable CRUD operations on Feast objects.", "keywords": ["feature store", "registry", "metadata management", "CRUD operations", "data source", "entity", "feature view", "on‑demand view", "stream view", "feature service", "permission", "project", "synchronization", "Python SDK", "infra"], "summary_hash": "11295ac6fb83", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:29:37+00:00"}
