{"summary": "The module provides utilities for analyzing two‑qubit unitary operators using their local invariants. It includes functions to compute the invariant quantities of a two‑qubit gate and to test whether two gates are equivalent up to local (single‑qubit) operations.", "business_intent": "Facilitate quantum circuit synthesis and optimization by allowing developers to classify and compare two‑qubit gates based on their intrinsic properties, enabling more efficient gate decomposition and hardware‑aware compilation.", "keywords": ["two-qubit", "local invariants", "unitary", "local equivalence", "quantum synthesis", "gate classification", "Qiskit", "circuit optimization", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "878c8b0b9a94", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:59:16+00:00"}
