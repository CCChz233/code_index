{"summary": "Provides a task that converts three‑dimensional image volumes into two‑dimensional maximum‑intensity projection images. It calculates the resulting shape, leverages Dask for lazy parallel computation, validates parameters, and reads/writes NGFF image data.", "business_intent": "Facilitate fast, scalable generation of 2D projection views from large 3D microscopy datasets to support visualization, quality control, and downstream quantitative analysis.", "keywords": ["maximum intensity projection", "3D to 2D", "Dask", "NGFF", "image processing", "lazy computation", "microscopy", "data reduction"], "summary_hash": "813669c52f0b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:56:47+00:00"}
