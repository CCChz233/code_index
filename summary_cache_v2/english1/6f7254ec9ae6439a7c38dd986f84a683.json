{"summary": "A 3‑D decoder component for a variational auto‑encoder that expands a latent tensor into a full‑resolution output sample. It builds a hierarchy of up‑sampling blocks, each applying configurable temporal and spatial expansion factors, channel scaling, and stacked residual units with a selectable non‑linearity (default swish). The design lets users tailor channel depth, block count, and expansion rates to reconstruct volumetric or video data from compressed representations.", "business_intent": "Enable generative and reconstruction pipelines that synthesize high‑fidelity 3‑D or spatio‑temporal data (e.g., video frames, medical volumes) from latent embeddings produced by an encoder, supporting downstream tasks such as content creation, simulation, or data compression.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "3D decoder", "upsampling", "residual blocks", "temporal expansion", "spatial expansion", "channel configuration", "swish activation", "generative modeling", "volumetric reconstruction"], "summary_hash": "ba0318bdc874", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:34:11+00:00"}
