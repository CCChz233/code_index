{"summary": "Defines a strategy that orchestrates multi‑process, single‑device training across one or more nodes using PyTorch DistributedDataParallel. It sets up the launch environment, initializes process groups, moves the model to the correct device, handles forward‑pass redirection, synchronizes gradients and parameters, manages optimizer steps, integrates with precision plugins and checkpointing, and ensures proper cleanup and error handling.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, efficient training of deep learning models on multiple GPUs and nodes by abstracting the complexities of distributed data parallel execution, thereby improving resource utilization and reducing time‑to‑solution for large‑scale AI workloads.", "keywords": ["distributed data parallel", "multi‑process training", "multi‑node", "GPU acceleration", "PyTorch", "Lightning", "strategy pattern", "process group initialization", "gradient synchronization", "optimizer coordination", "precision handling", "checkpoint integration", "fault tolerance", "resource scaling"], "summary_hash": "228a9a77622b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:53:01+00:00"}
