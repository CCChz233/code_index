{"summary": "This module implements a Faster R-CNN detector built on MXNet/GluonCV, combining a region proposal network, feature pyramid expansion, and ROI classification/regression heads. It defines the core model class and provides factory helpers for creating pretrained variants with different ResNet backbones.", "business_intent": "Offer a plug‑and‑play object detection solution that can be integrated into larger vision pipelines, such as scene‑graph generation, by supplying a configurable Faster R-CNN architecture with ready‑made pretrained weights.", "keywords": ["Faster R-CNN", "object detection", "region proposal network", "feature pyramid network", "MXNet", "GluonCV", "pretrained models", "ResNet backbone", "scene graph"], "summary_hash": "d7db07d3a33b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:10:58+00:00"}
