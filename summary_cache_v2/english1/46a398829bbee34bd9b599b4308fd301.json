{"summary": "Implements a GPT-compatible tokenizer that lowercases input text and applies a byte‑pair‑encoding scheme, optionally using SpaCy and ftfy for initial token splitting, with a fallback to a basic tokenizer. It manages a vocabulary and provides conversion between tokens and IDs, as well as utilities for saving and querying the vocabulary size.", "business_intent": "Enables applications to preprocess textual data for GPT‑style language models, ensuring consistent token representation for training, inference, and downstream NLP tasks.", "keywords": ["GPT", "tokenizer", "byte-pair encoding", "lowercasing", "SpaCy", "ftfy", "vocabulary management", "NLP preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "8a723f771a04", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:13:17+00:00"}
