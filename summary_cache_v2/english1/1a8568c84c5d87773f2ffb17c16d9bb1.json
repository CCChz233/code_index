{"summary": "This module defines the core components for an image‑to‑image generation workflow based on a latent consistency diffusion model. It provides a data container for scheduler steps, a scheduler that supports explicit timestamps while handling diffusion timesteps, noise scaling and variance, and a pipeline that orchestrates prompt encoding, latent preparation, timestep scheduling, embedding retrieval, safety checking, and final image synthesis.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run example that demonstrates how to transform input images according to textual prompts using latent consistency diffusion, enabling developers and researchers to integrate or extend image‑to‑image generation capabilities in their applications.", "keywords": ["latent diffusion", "image-to-image", "consistency scheduler", "prompt encoding", "safety checker", "diffusion pipeline", "PyTorch", "Diffusers", "transformers", "image processing"], "summary_hash": "f372a937056d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:01:36+00:00"}
