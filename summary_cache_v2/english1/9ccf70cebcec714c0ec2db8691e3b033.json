{"summary": "The module implements a full training pipeline for consistency distillation of a latent consistency model based on the Stable Diffusion XL architecture. It defines data handling for WebDataset text‑image pairs, a DDIM sampler, utilities for prompt encoding, embedding computation, EMA updates, and logging. Using the Accelerate library, it orchestrates distributed training, optimizer and scheduler setup, checkpointing, validation, and optional model upload to HuggingFace.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run example that enables researchers and engineers to train fast, lightweight diffusion models via consistency distillation on large-scale image‑text datasets, facilitating the creation of high‑quality text‑to‑image generators with reduced inference cost.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "consistency distillation", "latent consistency model", "SDXL", "WebDataset", "accelerate", "distributed training", "EMA", "validation", "checkpointing", "HuggingFace"], "summary_hash": "87454c05012a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:59:19+00:00"}
