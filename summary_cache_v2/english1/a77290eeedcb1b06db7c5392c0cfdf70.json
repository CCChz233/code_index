{"summary": "The module defines a collection of unit tests that validate the AHNet, FCN, and MCFCN network architectures from MONAI. It checks that the models produce tensors with the expected dimensions for both 2‑D and 3‑D inputs, that pretrained weight loading works correctly, and that associated example scripts execute without errors.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability and correctness of the deep‑learning segmentation models by automatically testing their shape handling, pretrained initialization, and script integration, thereby preventing regressions and supporting continuous integration.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "AHNet", "FCN", "MCFCN", "MONAI", "pretrained weights", "output shape verification", "2D", "3D", "script execution", "continuous integration"], "summary_hash": "9e9890f2f78f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:33:56+00:00"}
