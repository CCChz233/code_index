{"summary": "Implements a quantum circuit that adds two equally sized qubit registers directly within the quantum state using the Quantum Fourier Transform. The circuit can operate in a fixed‑point mode, performing addition modulo 2ⁿ, or in a half‑adder mode that introduces a carry qubit to realize ordinary addition.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable component for quantum algorithms that need efficient arithmetic, such as factoring, simulation, or optimization routines, by delivering a compact, in‑place addition operation with optional modular behavior.", "keywords": ["Quantum Fourier Transform", "QFT adder", "in‑place addition", "modular addition", "carry qubit", "quantum arithmetic", "Draper algorithm", "quantum circuit"], "summary_hash": "96e6cc5795db", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:38:01+00:00"}
