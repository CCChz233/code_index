{"summary": "The module defines custom iterator classes and a suite of helper functions that illustrate various for-loop patterns such as iterating over ranges, list literals, list comprehensions, generators, and custom iterables. These constructs are primarily used as test fixtures to exercise and benchmark iteration behavior.", "business_intent": "Provide test data and utilities for validating and measuring the performance of different iteration mechanisms within the test suite, especially in the context of compiled extensions like Cython.", "keywords": ["iterator", "custom iterable", "for-loop", "list comprehension", "range", "generator", "testing", "benchmark", "Cython"], "summary_hash": "d65cd0684533", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:24:40+00:00"}
