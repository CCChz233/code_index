{"summary": "Provides the binary serialization and deserialization logic for primitive and composite value objects used in Qiskit circuits, including numbers, strings, parameters, parameter expressions, classical registers, bits, and related types. It defines helpers to read and write these values to the QPY binary format, handling expression trees and parameter vectors.", "business_intent": "Facilitates compact, portable storage and exchange of quantum circuit data by converting circuit values and parameterized components to and from a binary representation, supporting efficient persistence and transmission of Qiskit workloads.", "keywords": ["serialization", "deserialization", "binary format", "QPY", "quantum circuit", "parameter", "expression tree", "classical register", "numpy", "symengine", "uuid"], "summary_hash": "2fc35be219c5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:08:49+00:00"}
