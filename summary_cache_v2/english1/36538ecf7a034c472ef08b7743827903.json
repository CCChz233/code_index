{"summary": "This module implements the core visual processing components for the Paint‑by‑Example diffusion pipeline. It provides an encoder that transforms input images into latent feature vectors using a CLIP vision backbone and transformer blocks, and a mapper that learns to convert example images into representations suitable for guiding the painting generation process.", "business_intent": "To empower applications that generate new images conditioned on example pictures, enabling style transfer, rapid prototyping, and creative content generation for designers, marketers, and developers.", "keywords": ["image encoding", "latent feature vectors", "CLIP vision model", "transformer block", "paint-by-example", "diffusion pipeline", "representation mapping", "neural network", "style transfer", "content generation"], "summary_hash": "2d964e996ac4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:24:19+00:00"}
