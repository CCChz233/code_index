{"summary": "The module implements a collection of bilateral and joint bilateral filtering operations for PyTorch, including standard, high‑dimensional (permutohedral lattice) and trainable variants. Custom autograd functions enable gradient‑based learning of spatial and intensity kernel widths, allowing these edge‑preserving filters to be integrated as differentiable layers within deep‑learning models, particularly for medical image denoising.", "business_intent": "Offer flexible, differentiable bilateral filtering tools that can be inserted into neural networks to perform learnable, edge‑aware smoothing of volumetric data, supporting low‑parameter training and improving performance in medical imaging applications such as CT denoising.", "keywords": ["bilateral filter", "joint bilateral filter", "trainable", "autograd", "PyTorch", "medical imaging", "denoising", "edge‑preserving", "permutohedral lattice", "high‑dimensional Gaussian", "low‑parameter"], "summary_hash": "60551f6a3172", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:15:52+00:00"}
