{"summary": "A collection of logger implementations for PyTorch Lightning that abstract experiment tracking across multiple back‑ends (TensorBoard, CSV/YAML, Comet.ml, MLflow, Neptune, Weights & Biases). It defines a core logger interface, handles experiment creation, metric and hyperparameter recording, model graph and checkpoint artifact management, and supports both local and remote storage.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless, standardized logging and monitoring of deep‑learning training runs to improve reproducibility, debugging, and insight generation for data science and ML engineering teams.", "keywords": ["logging", "experiment tracking", "PyTorch Lightning", "TensorBoard", "Comet.ml", "MLflow", "Neptune", "Weights & Biases", "CSV logger", "metrics", "hyperparameters", "checkpoints", "artifacts", "remote storage"], "summary_hash": "b68919196e38", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:13:35+00:00"}
