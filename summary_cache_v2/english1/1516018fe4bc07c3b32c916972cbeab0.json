{"summary": "The module is an example script that demonstrates how to fine‑tune a Megatron‑based GPT model using supervised fine‑tuning (SFT) with a chat‑style dataset. It loads and validates configuration, optionally restores model checkpoints, initializes the Megatron GPT SFT model, prepares the data pipeline, configures a PyTorch Lightning trainer with NeMo‑specific plugins for mixed precision and distributed training, and runs the training loop.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run reference for developers and researchers to customize and train large language models for conversational applications, facilitating reproducible experiments and easy integration of checkpoint handling and distributed training capabilities.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "GPT", "Supervised Fine‑Tuning", "SFT", "NeMo", "language modeling", "chat dataset", "checkpoint loading", "distributed training", "PyTorch Lightning", "mixed precision"], "summary_hash": "ba4a1aa9c674", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:46:44+00:00"}
