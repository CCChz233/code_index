{"summary": "Implements a latent‑diffusion based super‑resolution pipeline that encodes an input image into a latent space with a vector‑quantized model, iteratively denoises the latent representation using a UNet guided by a scheduler, and decodes the refined latent back to a higher‑resolution image.", "business_intent": "Provides a ready‑to‑use solution for upscaling low‑resolution images to higher quality, supporting use‑cases such as photo enhancement, content creation, medical or satellite image analysis, and any application requiring improved visual detail.", "keywords": ["super-resolution", "latent diffusion", "VQ‑VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "image upscaling", "diffusion pipeline", "high‑resolution generation"], "summary_hash": "e579e076aa21", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:15:09+00:00"}
