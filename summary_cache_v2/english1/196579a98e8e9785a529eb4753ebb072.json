{"summary": "Utility module for the Albumentations library that offers helper functions and classes to read images in various color spaces, validate image types, handle edge cases such as empty arrays, and provide generic decorator and wrapper utilities. It also includes mathematical helpers like angle normalization and a PCA implementation used by augmentations.", "business_intent": "Facilitate reliable and efficient image preprocessing for data augmentation pipelines by abstracting low‑level image I/O, format checks, and reusable decorator logic, thereby reducing boilerplate and preventing runtime errors in computer‑vision workflows.", "keywords": ["image reading", "color space conversion", "grayscale", "RGB", "multispectral", "validation", "decorator", "wrapper", "PCA", "angle normalization", "range checking", "OpenCV", "NumPy"], "summary_hash": "73e7d03fe7e2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:27:39+00:00"}
