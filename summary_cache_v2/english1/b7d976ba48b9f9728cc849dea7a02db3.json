{"summary": "Implements a Keras preprocessing layer that randomly zooms images (or batches) during training, allowing independent vertical and horizontal scaling within configurable ranges, handling out‑of‑bounds pixels via selectable fill modes, supporting different interpolation methods and data formats, and outputting tensors with the appropriate target dimensions.", "business_intent": "Increase training data diversity through random zoom augmentation, helping models become more robust and generalize better to variations in object size and scale.", "keywords": ["image augmentation", "random zoom", "preprocessing layer", "Keras", "TensorFlow", "data pipeline", "zoom factor", "fill mode", "interpolation", "training robustness"], "summary_hash": "920c61ae8dea", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:05:08+00:00"}
