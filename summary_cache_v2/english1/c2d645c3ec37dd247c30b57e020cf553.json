{"summary": "This module implements a suite of PyTorch normalization layers designed for diffusion and generative models. It includes adaptive group and layer normalization variants that integrate timestep or modality embeddings, RMS‑based norms, and zero‑initialized scaling versions. The layers provide conditional scaling and shifting of activations, enhancing training stability and flexibility across diverse model architectures.", "business_intent": "Supply reusable, configurable normalization components that enable diffusion and other generative models to condition their activations on temporal or contextual signals, thereby improving model stability, convergence speed, and generation quality.", "keywords": ["normalization", "adaptive layer norm", "group norm", "RMS norm", "timestep embeddings", "conditional scaling", "PyTorch", "diffusion models", "generative AI", "training stability"], "summary_hash": "50d760d14558", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:15:23+00:00"}
