{"summary": "A training script that sets up and runs a hybrid automatic speech recognition and text‑to‑speech model, allowing the use of paired audio‑text data together with pure text corpora. It configures the ASR component, integrates a pre‑trained TTS model, optional enhancer, BPE tokenizer, and manages experiment logging and checkpointing.", "business_intent": "To enable developers and researchers to improve speech recognition accuracy by leveraging synthetic speech generated from large text‑only datasets, while providing a flexible, configurable pipeline for multimodal ASR‑TTS training and experiment tracking.", "keywords": ["ASR", "TTS", "hybrid model", "speech recognition", "text‑to‑speech", "BPE tokenizer", "text‑only data", "audio‑text pairs", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "experiment management", "WandB logging"], "summary_hash": "7b12141b5ae6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:40:11+00:00"}
