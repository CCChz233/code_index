{"summary": "The lexical package provides a Maui‑style lexical matching system for the Annif framework. It includes a lightweight token‑set container and index for fast token matching, utilities for handling subject labels and constructing sparse matrices that represent subject collections and hierarchies, and a machine‑learning component that generates candidate subjects, creates feature vectors using token‑set statistics and IDF weighting, and trains a bagging ensemble of decision‑tree classifiers to rank and predict the most relevant subjects.", "business_intent": "To automatically suggest relevant subject headings for documents by extracting lexical features and applying supervised learning, thereby enhancing Annif's capability for efficient and accurate subject indexing.", "keywords": ["lexical matching", "token set", "IDF weighting", "bagging ensemble", "decision tree", "subject indexing", "Annif", "feature vectors", "hierarchical relations", "sparse matrix"], "summary_hash": "5d63b667817e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:37:01+00:00"}
