{"summary": "Defines a diffusion pipeline that transforms textual prompts into images using the Kandinsky 2.2 architecture. The pipeline coordinates a scheduler, a conditional UNet denoiser, and a VQ decoder to generate latent representations and decode them into high‑resolution pictures, while also providing utilities for image size handling.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and end‑users to generate AI‑driven visual content from natural language descriptions, supporting creative applications such as artwork creation, design prototyping, and content enrichment.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "diffusion pipeline", "Kandinsky 2.2", "conditional UNet", "VQ decoder", "scheduler", "latent generation", "image synthesis", "AI art", "size scaling utility"], "summary_hash": "1715be12b167", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:26:39+00:00"}
