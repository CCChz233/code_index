{"summary": "Implements a fully differentiable pipeline that mimics classic local feature detectors (e.g., Harris, Hessian‑Affine, SIFT). It constructs a multi‑scale pyramid, evaluates a cornerness response, applies a soft non‑maximum suppression to locate extrema, and optionally refines each keypoint with affine shape and orientation estimators. The detector always returns a fixed number of keypoints, making it batch‑compatible and allowing any of the internal modules to be swapped with learned alternatives.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, trainable feature detection component that can be embedded in deep learning models, enabling end‑to‑end optimization of keypoint detection while preserving the behavior of traditional detectors.", "keywords": ["differentiable", "local feature detection", "scale pyramid", "cornerness response", "soft NMS", "affine shape estimation", "orientation estimation", "batchable", "learnable modules", "SIFT", "Harris", "Hessian-Affine"], "summary_hash": "12d24d8c7c1d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:42:07+00:00"}
