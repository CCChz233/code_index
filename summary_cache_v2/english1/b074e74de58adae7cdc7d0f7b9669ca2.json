{"summary": "The module prepares an OME-NGFF Zarr hierarchy for CellVoyager microscopy datasets. It parses Yokogawa metadata, extracts well and field‑of‑view identifiers, defines OME channel specifications, constructs plate and well structures, generates ROI tables, removes overlapping regions, and writes the resulting metadata tables into a Zarr group, optionally overwriting existing content.", "business_intent": "To standardize CellVoyager image data into the OME-NGFF format, enabling seamless integration with downstream imaging analysis, visualization, and sharing workflows across research and clinical environments.", "keywords": ["OME-NGFF", "Zarr", "CellVoyager", "microscopy", "metadata parsing", "plate layout", "well indexing", "channel definition", "ROI tables", "data conversion", "image storage"], "summary_hash": "b2a7e66c214b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:56:28+00:00"}
