{"summary": "Implements a 2‑D depthwise convolution layer that processes each input channel independently with its own kernel, optionally expanding channels via a depth multiplier and supporting stride, padding, dilation, activation, bias, initializers, regularizers and constraints, while handling both channels‑last and channels‑first data formats.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient channel‑wise convolution as the first step of depthwise separable convolutions, allowing model size reduction and computational speed‑up in deep‑learning architectures.", "keywords": ["depthwise convolution", "2D layer", "channel-wise filtering", "depth multiplier", "stride", "padding", "dilation", "activation", "bias", "initializer", "regularizer", "constraint", "data format", "Keras"], "summary_hash": "593b800a80a8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:55:15+00:00"}
