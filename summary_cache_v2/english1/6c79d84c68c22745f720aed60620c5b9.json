{"summary": "A collection of asynchronous load‑testing modules that stress the litellm client against external services such as Datadog, LangSmith, OpenTelemetry, and Vertex AI. Each test creates many concurrent tasks, invokes the target API, captures response times, and asserts that logging, tracing, and latency requirements are satisfied.", "business_intent": "Ensure that monitoring, tracing, and AI service integrations remain reliable and meet performance SLAs when subjected to high concurrent load, thereby protecting system stability and user experience.", "keywords": ["load testing", "asynchronous", "concurrency", "litellm", "logging integration", "tracing", "Datadog", "LangSmith", "OpenTelemetry", "Vertex AI", "embeddings", "performance", "latency", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "353593f9504a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:02:53+00:00"}
