{"summary": "An abstract neural‑network layer that implements separable convolution by first applying a depthwise convolution independently on each input channel and then a pointwise convolution to combine the resulting features. It supports configurable kernel size, stride, padding, dilation, data format, activation, bias addition, and various initializers, regularizers and constraints.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, configurable component for building efficient deep‑learning models that require channel‑wise processing followed by channel mixing, reducing parameter count and computational cost compared to standard convolutions.", "keywords": ["separable convolution", "depthwise convolution", "pointwise convolution", "neural network layer", "Keras", "bias", "activation", "regularization", "padding", "stride", "dilation", "data format"], "summary_hash": "e26f6ca93d63", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:55:41+00:00"}
