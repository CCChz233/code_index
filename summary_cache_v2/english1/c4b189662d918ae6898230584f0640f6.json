{"summary": "A neural machine translation model that employs a bottleneck latent variable architecture and can be trained using standard cross‑entropy, variational auto‑encoder, or masked‑image‑modeling objectives. It encodes source sentences, compresses them into a latent space, and decodes them into target translations while providing utilities for batch inference, loss computation, and training/evaluation loops.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to build and deploy translation systems that learn compact, regularized representations, offering flexibility to experiment with different probabilistic training regimes and improve translation performance in multilingual applications.", "keywords": ["machine translation", "bottleneck architecture", "latent variable model", "cross entropy loss", "variational autoencoder", "MIM loss", "encoder‑decoder", "training loop", "evaluation", "batch inference"], "summary_hash": "31fba221f51d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:06:10+00:00"}
