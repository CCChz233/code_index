{"summary": "The module implements a system for programmatically generating CMake toolchain files tailored to Conan packages. It defines lightweight helper components that encapsulate distinct configuration aspects—such as system info, compiler options, architecture, flags, variables, output directories, and platform‑specific tweaks—and a central orchestrator that discovers the appropriate CMake executable, selects a suitable generator, composes these components, and writes the final toolchain script.", "business_intent": "Automate and standardize the creation of CMake toolchain files so that Conan-managed projects can reliably configure compilers, flags, and paths across different platforms and build environments, reducing manual setup and build errors.", "keywords": ["CMake", "toolchain", "Conan", "build configuration", "compiler settings", "flags", "variables", "modular blocks", "generator selection", "cross‑platform", "automation"], "summary_hash": "8dfd583ffd99", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:32:05+00:00"}
