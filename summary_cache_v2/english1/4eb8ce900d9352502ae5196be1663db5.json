{"summary": "The module provides a full training pipeline for consistency distillation of a Stable Diffusion model using latent consistency (LCM) techniques. It defines a DDIM sampler, a WebDataset‑based text‑to‑image dataset, filtering utilities, and helper functions for embedding and noise prediction. The main routine parses command‑line arguments, configures an Accelerate accelerator, loads the base diffusion model, sets up optimizers, learning‑rate schedulers, EMA updates, and runs the training loop with optional validation and logging.", "business_intent": "To enable developers and AI service providers to train lightweight, fast‑inference text‑to‑image models by distilling large diffusion models, reducing computational cost while preserving generation quality for content creation, advertising, and creative applications.", "keywords": ["diffusion models", "consistency distillation", "latent consistency model", "Stable Diffusion", "WebDataset", "DDIM sampler", "training pipeline", "accelerate", "EMA", "text-to-image generation", "model compression"], "summary_hash": "62f227a932ac", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:59:12+00:00"}
