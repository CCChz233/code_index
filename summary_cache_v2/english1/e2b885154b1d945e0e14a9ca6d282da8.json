{"summary": "This module implements low‑level utilities for performing numerical integration on a Uxarray grid. It computes arc lengths of cell edges, determines intersections of constant‑latitude lines with grid faces, calculates zonal weighting factors, and processes overlapping intervals, leveraging Numba for performance.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate and efficient calculation of zonal (latitude‑based) integrals and related metrics across unstructured grid cells, supporting scientific analyses that require precise area‑weighted integration of fields on the grid.", "keywords": ["integration", "grid", "zonal", "latitude", "arc length", "weights", "numba", "overlapping intervals", "edge processing", "geospatial"], "summary_hash": "2d476dbeb6fd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:27:29+00:00"}
