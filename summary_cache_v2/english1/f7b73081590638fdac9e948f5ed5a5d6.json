{"summary": "The script implements a full training and evaluation pipeline for a graph neural network on the OGB Large-Scale Challenge PCQM4M dataset using PyTorch and DGL. It parses command‑line arguments, loads the dataset, prepares data loaders, constructs the model, configures the optimizer and learning‑rate scheduler, runs the training loop with optional TensorBoard logging, and computes benchmark metrics via the OGB evaluator.", "business_intent": "To provide a reproducible example that demonstrates how to train and benchmark a GNN model for molecular property prediction on a large quantum chemistry dataset, facilitating research, development, and performance comparison in the field of graph‑based deep learning.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "DGL", "graph neural network", "PCQM4M", "OGB LSC", "molecular property prediction", "training loop", "evaluation", "optimizer", "learning rate scheduler", "TensorBoard"], "summary_hash": "8b1591ae12a3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:33:40+00:00"}
