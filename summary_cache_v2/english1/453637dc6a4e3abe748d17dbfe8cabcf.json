{"summary": "This module implements a process-based launcher that spawns a separate operating system process to execute a benchmark according to a supplied configuration. It sets up inter‑process communication, configures logging, captures any exceptions, and assembles the results into a benchmark report while ensuring proper cleanup of resources.", "business_intent": "Provide a robust mechanism for running benchmark workloads in isolated processes, enabling parallel execution, resource isolation, and reliable collection of performance data for downstream analysis.", "keywords": ["process launcher", "multiprocessing", "benchmark execution", "inter‑process communication", "logging", "configuration", "report generation", "resource isolation"], "summary_hash": "7423decf7989", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:31:50+00:00"}
