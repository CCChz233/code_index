{"summary": "The module implements a TensorRT‑accelerated Stable Diffusion pipeline for converting textual prompts into images. It defines abstractions for model configuration, optimization, and engine management, builds ONNX/TensorRT engines for CLIP, UNet, and VAE components, and orchestrates prompt encoding, latent denoising, decoding, and optional safety filtering to produce high‑performance image generation.", "business_intent": "Provide a fast, GPU‑optimized solution for deploying Stable Diffusion text‑to‑image generation in production or edge scenarios, reducing latency and resource usage while maintaining quality and safety checks.", "keywords": ["TensorRT", "Stable Diffusion", "text-to-image", "ONNX", "GPU acceleration", "CLIP", "UNet", "VAE", "inference optimization", "safety checker", "prompt encoding", "image generation"], "summary_hash": "5d9a129ad48c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:00:21+00:00"}
