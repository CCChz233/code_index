{"summary": "Implements a configurable inference pipeline that combines automatic speech recognition (ASR) and voice activity detection (VAD). It accepts either a manifest file or a directory of audio files, loads NeMo ASR and VAD models, optionally applies feature masking or dropping based on RTTM files, supports profiling, and outputs transcriptions and VAD segments.", "business_intent": "Enable automated transcription and speech activity analysis for audio datasets, supporting flexible preprocessing and model selection to streamline data labeling, content indexing, and speech analytics workflows.", "keywords": ["automatic speech recognition", "ASR", "voice activity detection", "VAD", "inference pipeline", "audio manifest", "feature masking", "RTTM", "profiling", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "c3736a1fe0d5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:38:57+00:00"}
