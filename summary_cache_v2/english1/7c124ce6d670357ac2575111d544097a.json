{"summary": "The module supplies a collection of Qiskit transpiler passes that transform quantum circuits into a specified hardware‑compatible gate basis. It includes passes for translating arbitrary gates using an equivalence library, expanding custom and parameterized gates, and recursively unrolling multi‑qubit operations into one‑ and two‑qubit primitives, all via DAG‑based circuit manipulation.", "business_intent": "Facilitate reliable compilation of quantum algorithms onto real quantum processors by ensuring circuits are expressed solely in the supported native gate set, improving execution fidelity and simplifying downstream optimization.", "keywords": ["transpiler", "gate basis translation", "gate decomposition", "unrolling", "custom definitions", "parameterized gates", "DAG", "quantum circuit compilation", "Qiskit", "hardware compatibility"], "summary_hash": "b1f3a2a0a2aa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:08:37+00:00"}
