{"summary": "The module defines a framework for synchronizing model layer states across multiple processes in distributed PyTorch training. It provides an abstract base for layer‑synchronization plugins and a concrete implementation that automatically wraps batch‑normalization layers to keep their running statistics consistent across workers, while remaining a no‑op on single‑device runs. An internal utility supports batch‑norm operations for tensors of any dimensionality.", "business_intent": "Enable robust and scalable distributed training by ensuring that layer statistics, especially batch‑norm moments, are correctly shared among parallel processes, thereby improving model convergence, reproducibility, and performance in multi‑GPU or multi‑node environments.", "keywords": ["synchronization", "batch normalization", "distributed training", "multiprocessing", "plugin architecture", "layer state management", "PyTorch Lightning", "multi‑process consistency", "model parallelism", "running statistics"], "summary_hash": "97e1da32ce9b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:53:06+00:00"}
