{"summary": "The module implements dataset classes that stream audio data for vocoder training from tarred archives using a JSON manifest. It supports optional resampling, duration-based filtering, truncation, random sub‑sampling, and feature extraction, while handling shard distribution for distributed training environments.", "business_intent": "Facilitate efficient, scalable training of speech synthesis vocoder models by providing high‑performance data loading and preprocessing pipelines that work with large, tar‑packed audio collections in distributed settings.", "keywords": ["vocoder", "audio dataset", "tar archives", "manifest", "streaming", "resampling", "duration filtering", "feature processing", "distributed training", "webdataset", "PyTorch Dataset"], "summary_hash": "70aa907e3a08", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:55:52+00:00"}
