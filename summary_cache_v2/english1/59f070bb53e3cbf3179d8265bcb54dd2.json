{"summary": "The module defines a loss component for sentence‑transformer models that computes a margin‑based objective over extremely large batches. It includes utilities to process data in smaller mini‑batches while still evaluating the loss as if the full batch were used, leveraging PyTorch operations for efficient similarity and distance calculations.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, memory‑efficient margin loss to accelerate and improve the training of sentence embedding models on massive datasets, enabling higher‑quality embeddings without prohibitive GPU memory consumption.", "keywords": ["margin loss", "large batch training", "mega batch", "sentence transformer", "contrastive learning", "mini‑batch processing", "PyTorch", "embedding similarity", "scalable training"], "summary_hash": "a4efa1788ee9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:59:19+00:00"}
