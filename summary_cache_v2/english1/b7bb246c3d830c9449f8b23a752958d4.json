{"summary": "A configuration container for the BLIP text model that encapsulates all architectural and training hyperparameters such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of transformer layers, attention heads, dropout rates, token identifiers, decoder mode, caching behavior, and optional label smoothing. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class, enabling seamless model instantiation and reproducibility.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to define, customize, and reproduce BLIP text model architectures and training settings without hard‑coding values, simplifying model creation, fine‑tuning, and deployment.", "keywords": ["BLIP", "text model", "configuration", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "dropout", "token ids", "decoder", "cache", "label smoothing", "pretrained config"], "summary_hash": "e554fb6aef84", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:08:18+00:00"}
