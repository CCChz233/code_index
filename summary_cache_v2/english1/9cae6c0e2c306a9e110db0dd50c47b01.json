{"summary": "A command‑line script that orchestrates the training of a Graph Convolutional Network using the GraphSAINT sampling framework. It loads graph data, selects a sampling strategy (node, edge, or random‑walk), constructs data loaders, runs the training epochs with loss computation and back‑propagation, evaluates performance on validation and test sets, and records metrics via a logging utility.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run example for researchers and engineers to benchmark and develop scalable graph neural network models on large graphs, demonstrating how to integrate GraphSAINT sampling with PyTorch for node classification tasks.", "keywords": ["GraphSAINT", "GCN", "PyTorch", "graph sampling", "node classification", "training loop", "evaluation", "logging", "command line interface"], "summary_hash": "a14257cad9f7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:23:41+00:00"}
