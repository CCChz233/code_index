The instruction says \"Do NOT list method names verbatim.\" So we cannot include method names like \"read\", \"unget\", \"close\", \"parts\", \"__iter__\", etc. So we must avoid those words exactly as method names. However we can use synonyms like \"retrieve data\", \"push back bytes\". But \"read\" is a common word; but they said \"method names verbatim\". The method name \"read\" is a verb; using \"read\" might be considered verbatim. Safer to avoid \"read\". Use \"retrieve\", \"consume\". For \"unget\", use \"push back\".
