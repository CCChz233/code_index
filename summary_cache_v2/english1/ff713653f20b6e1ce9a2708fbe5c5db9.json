{"summary": "A standalone example script that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a self‑attention graph pooling (SAGPool) network for graph classification using DGL and PyTorch. It loads a TUDataset, constructs the SAGPool model, runs a training loop with optional logging, and reports performance metrics.", "business_intent": "To provide developers and researchers with a ready‑to‑run reference implementation of SAGPool, illustrating its integration with DGL's data pipeline and PyTorch training workflow for graph‑level tasks.", "keywords": ["DGL", "PyTorch", "SAGPool", "graph neural network", "graph classification", "TUDataset", "training loop", "example script", "self‑attention pooling"], "summary_hash": "d2b5c1141e17", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:19:44+00:00"}
