{"summary": "Provides a tokenizer tailored for wav2vec2 models that operate on phoneme sequences for CTC training and inference. It loads a vocabulary, manages special tokens (bos, eos, unk, pad), optionally phonemizes raw text using a configurable language and backend, and offers encoding, decoding, and batch processing utilities.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless preparation and conversion of textual data into phoneme token IDs for speech recognition systems using wav2vec2 CTC architectures, supporting language‑specific phonemization and standard token handling.", "keywords": ["tokenizer", "phonemizer", "wav2vec2", "CTC", "phoneme", "vocabulary", "special tokens", "language support", "backend", "speech recognition", "encoding", "decoding"], "summary_hash": "7355af86415a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:10:18+00:00"}
