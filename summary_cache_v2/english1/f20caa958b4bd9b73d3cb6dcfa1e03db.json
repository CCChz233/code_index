{"summary": "Provides example scripts for training and running inference with a ControlNet‑enhanced text‑to‑image diffusion model using the Megatron framework. The training script configures a customizable training loop with Hydra and experiment management, while the inference script loads a pretrained model, processes textual prompts and optional control inputs (e.g., edge maps), executes a diffusion sampler, and saves the generated images.", "business_intent": "Showcase how to fine‑tune and deploy a ControlNet‑augmented text‑to‑image generation system, allowing developers to train the model on custom datasets and generate images conditioned on prompts and auxiliary control signals.", "keywords": ["ControlNet", "text-to-image", "diffusion", "Megatron", "training pipeline", "inference pipeline", "Hydra", "image generation", "sampler", "edge maps", "experiment manager"], "summary_hash": "88bc3ed3613b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:56:38+00:00"}
