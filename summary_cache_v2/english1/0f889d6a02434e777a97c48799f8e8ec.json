{"summary": "Encapsulates the qubit placement information produced by the Qiskit transpiler, tracking the relationship between virtual (logical) qubits and physical hardware qubits throughout the layout and routing stages. It provides utilities for creating, copying, composing, inverting, and reordering these mappings, as well as accessing initial and final layouts and routing permutations.", "business_intent": "Facilitates accurate mapping and transformation of quantum circuits during transpilation, enabling downstream tools and users to understand and manipulate qubit placements for optimization, visualization, and execution on quantum hardware.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "transpiler", "layout", "qubit mapping", "virtual qubits", "physical qubits", "routing permutation", "swap insertion", "circuit optimization", "quantum hardware"], "summary_hash": "7bbf745373fb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:55:19+00:00"}
