{"summary": "This module augments GDB with Python‑specific introspection and control features. It interprets raw PyObject pointers from a debugged process, creates high‑level proxy objects, and supplies pretty‑printing for strings, numbers, containers, frames, and exceptions. It also defines GDB commands for stepping, breaking, and querying Python frames, locals, globals, and backtraces, handling cyclic references and lazy type resolution.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with a seamless way to debug Python applications inside GDB by translating low‑level interpreter data into readable Python structures and offering execution‑control commands, thereby improving visibility into program state without leaving the native debugger.", "keywords": ["gdb", "python debugging", "libpython", "pretty printer", "proxy objects", "execution control", "frames", "objects", "visualization", "stepping", "breakpoints", "backtrace", "exception handling"], "summary_hash": "ae991fbbdfc5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:32:43+00:00"}
