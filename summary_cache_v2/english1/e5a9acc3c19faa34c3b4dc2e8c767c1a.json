{"summary": "The module implements preprocessing and post‑processing utilities used in bias adjustment workflows for climate datasets. It handles grouping of data by frequency, normalizing variables, applying additive or multiplicative corrections, jittering low‑value observations, and interfacing with xarray and dask structures.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable bias correction of climate model outputs by preparing data (grouping, normalizing, jittering) before adjustment and applying the corrected values afterward, supporting scalable analysis with dask.", "keywords": ["bias adjustment", "climate data", "preprocessing", "postprocessing", "normalization", "frequency adaptation", "jitter", "correction", "xarray", "dask"], "summary_hash": "55abaac22ce7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:32:13+00:00"}
