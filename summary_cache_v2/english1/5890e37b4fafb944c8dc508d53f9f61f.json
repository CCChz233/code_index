{"summary": "The DeepEdit package provides tools for interactive medical image segmentation in MONAI. It includes a component that simulates user click interactions during model training or inference, allowing configurable click probabilities, optional preprocessing, and limits on interaction count. Additionally, it offers a suite of custom data transforms that create and modify guidance cues such as point-based prompts, Gaussian‑blurred guidance maps, random seed points, and discrepancy regions, as well as utilities for slice selection, label normalization, and resizing to keep guidance aligned with image transformations.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient development and evaluation of interactive segmentation models by automating user interaction simulation and supplying specialized data augmentation transforms that generate guidance information, thereby improving model training and performance in clinical imaging applications.", "keywords": ["interactive segmentation", "medical imaging", "deep learning", "simulated user clicks", "guidance cues", "point prompts", "Gaussian maps", "label normalization", "slice selection", "MONAI", "DeepEdit"], "summary_hash": "9df1565abd69", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:31:07+00:00"}
