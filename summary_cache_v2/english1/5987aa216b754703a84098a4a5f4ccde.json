{"summary": "The module supplies shared utilities for configuring and managing adapter components and implements a lightweight linear adapter that inserts a single hidden‑layer feed‑forward block with optional LayerNorm and dropout into a host model. The adapter mirrors input dimensions, applies an activation, and initializes its output to zero so it can be disabled without affecting the original model.", "business_intent": "Enable parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning of large neural networks by providing configurable, trainable adapter layers that can be added, frozen, or unfrozen as needed.", "keywords": ["adapter", "linear adapter", "parameter-efficient fine-tuning", "layer normalization", "dropout", "activation function", "configuration", "strategy pattern", "unfreeze", "PyTorch", "Hydra", "OmegaConf"], "summary_hash": "46aed9e4fac1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:51:34+00:00"}
