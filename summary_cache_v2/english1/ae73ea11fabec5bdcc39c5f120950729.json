{"summary": "Provides a thread‑synchronization primitive that blocks until a predefined count of signals is received, then releases any waiting threads. The implementation is used within the ASL evaluation engine to coordinate concurrent execution paths.", "business_intent": "Facilitate safe coordination of parallel state executions in the Step Functions parser, ensuring that threads wait for all required events before proceeding.", "keywords": ["threading", "synchronization", "countdown latch", "concurrency", "wait", "signal", "step functions", "ASL evaluation"], "summary_hash": "08adbde3f798", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:06:42+00:00"}
