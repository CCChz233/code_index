{"summary": "A configuration container that defines all architectural and training hyper‑parameters for the text decoder component of a Pix2Struct model, such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, feed‑forward size, number of layers and heads, attention bucket settings, dropout, layer‑norm epsilon, activation function, special token identifiers and caching behavior. It inherits from the generic pretrained configuration class so it can be saved, loaded and passed to a Pix2Struct text model to reproduce or customize a pretrained architecture.", "business_intent": "Provide developers a simple, reproducible way to instantiate, customize and share Pix2Struct text decoder models for vision‑to‑text applications, ensuring compatibility with existing pretrained checkpoints and allowing fine‑tuning or new training with user‑defined hyper‑parameters.", "keywords": ["configuration", "transformer decoder", "text model", "hyper‑parameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "dropout", "activation function", "token ids", "caching", "pretrained"], "summary_hash": "0bb5dff4bb31", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:43:15+00:00"}
