{"summary": "The script orchestrates the end‑to‑end workflow for training and evaluating SEAL (Subgraph Extraction and Labeling) link‑prediction models on OGB graph datasets using DGL and PyTorch. It parses arguments, loads the dataset, prepares subgraph samplers, builds GCN/DGCNN encoders, runs a training loop with BCE loss, and reports Hits@K metrics.", "business_intent": "Provide a reproducible example for researchers and engineers to benchmark SEAL‑based graph neural network models on standard link‑prediction datasets, enabling quick experimentation and performance evaluation.", "keywords": ["link prediction", "SEAL", "graph neural network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "OGB", "GCN", "DGCNN", "training loop", "evaluation", "Hits@K"], "summary_hash": "ef26596df416", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:20:53+00:00"}
