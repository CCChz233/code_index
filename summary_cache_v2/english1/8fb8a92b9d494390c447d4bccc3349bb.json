{"summary": "The module defines a TripletEvaluator that assesses sentence embedding models using triplet datasets (anchor, positive, negative). It computes pairwise similarity scores with configurable metrics (cosine, dot, Euclidean, Manhattan), checks whether the anchor-positive similarity exceeds the anchor-negative similarity by a given margin, and reports overall accuracy and optional detailed logs.", "business_intent": "To provide a reliable metric for comparing and fine‑tuning sentence embedding models in natural language processing applications where relative similarity ordering is critical, such as semantic search, paraphrase detection, and recommendation systems.", "keywords": ["sentence embeddings", "model evaluation", "triplet loss", "similarity metrics", "accuracy measurement", "margin threshold", "NLP benchmarking", "cosine similarity", "semantic similarity"], "summary_hash": "8a40d0df2dfa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:56:20+00:00"}
