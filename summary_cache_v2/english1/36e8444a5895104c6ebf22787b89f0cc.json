{"summary": "This module supplies a configurable training benchmark framework. It defines a validation‑rich configuration model for specifying dataset shapes, default parameters, and logging, and implements the benchmark workflow that initializes the execution backend, prepares the dataset, performs warm‑up and actual training runs, captures energy usage, latency, throughput, and memory consumption, and aggregates the results into a comprehensive report.", "business_intent": "Enable consistent, reproducible measurement of training performance and resource efficiency for machine‑learning models, facilitating comparison across hardware platforms and software environments.", "keywords": ["training benchmark", "configuration model", "performance metrics", "energy consumption", "latency", "throughput", "memory usage", "reproducibility", "dataset handling", "backend initialization", "warm‑up phase", "benchmark reporting"], "summary_hash": "f2557a6d509d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:33:30+00:00"}
