{"summary": "The module defines a collection of reusable schema classes and utilities for validating xarray and xugrid data structures. It checks aspects such as coordinate presence, dimension consistency, data types, value ranges, uniqueness, NoData handling, active‑cell connectivity, and other domain‑specific constraints, allowing schemas to be combined with logical OR operations.", "business_intent": "To ensure that input datasets supplied to the groundwater modeling workflow meet strict structural and semantic requirements, thereby preventing runtime errors, convergence problems, and inaccurate simulation results.", "keywords": ["validation", "schema", "xarray", "xugrid", "coordinates", "dimensions", "dtype", "NoData", "active cells", "uniqueness", "value range", "options", "data integrity"], "summary_hash": "947bd7cd5f0b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:41:32+00:00"}
