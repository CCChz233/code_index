{"summary": "A unit‑test module that checks the correctness of a random intensity scaling transform which preserves a fixed mean value. It creates synthetic image data, applies the transform under controlled randomness, and asserts that the resulting intensities match the expected scaled values.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the intensity scaling preprocessing step used in medical imaging pipelines behaves reliably, maintaining a constant mean across augmented images to improve model training stability and reproducibility.", "keywords": ["unit test", "intensity scaling", "fixed mean", "MONAI", "NumPy", "image augmentation", "validation", "random transform", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "b9b92e58eabd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:41:44+00:00"}
