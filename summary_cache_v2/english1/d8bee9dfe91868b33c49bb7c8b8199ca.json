{"summary": "Implements a semi‑supervised graph neural network based on the InfoGraph architecture. It accepts node feature matrices of size in_dim, projects them into a hidden space of size hid_dim, and computes graph‑level embeddings through a forward pass. An additional unsupervised forward method produces representations used for contrastive or self‑supervised objectives.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable component for learning high‑quality node or graph embeddings from partially labeled graph data, supporting downstream analytics such as classification, recommendation, or anomaly detection in domains where labeling is scarce.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "semi-supervised learning", "InfoGraph", "embedding", "DGL", "forward pass", "unsupervised representation", "hidden dimension"], "summary_hash": "98c1eae3eebe", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:17:41+00:00"}
