{"summary": "A data‑class that aggregates every configurable option required to run a DDPO training session, including experiment naming, random seed, logging/tracking integration, accelerator and project settings, checkpoint handling, mixed‑precision and TF32 flags, resume capability, sampling hyper‑parameters, training batch sizes, optimizer and PPO hyper‑parameters, gradient clipping and accumulation, inner‑epoch control, classifier‑free guidance toggles, advantage clipping, timestep fraction, per‑prompt statistics tracking, asynchronous reward computation, negative prompt handling, and optional model push to the Hub.", "business_intent": "To provide a single, validated source of truth for all DDPO training parameters so that experiments can be reproducibly configured, launched via command‑line or code, tracked with external services, and managed with consistent checkpointing and deployment workflows.", "keywords": ["configuration", "DDPO", "training", "hyperparameters", "logging", "checkpointing", "sampling", "optimizer", "mixed precision", "accelerator", "reward computation", "classifier-free guidance", "reinforcement learning", "experiment tracking"], "summary_hash": "ac1f30b2f5fe", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:00:34+00:00"}
