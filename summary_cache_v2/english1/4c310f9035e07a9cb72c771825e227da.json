{"summary": "A configuration container that encapsulates all architectural and training hyper‑parameters for a ConvNeXTV2 vision model, such as input channels, patch size, stage depths, hidden dimensions, activation function, initialization scale, normalization epsilon, stochastic depth rate, and optional output feature selections. The object is passed to the model constructor to build a ConvNeXTV2 instance matching a specific pretrained variant or a custom design.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, reproducible way for developers and researchers to define, modify, and share ConvNeXTV2 model specifications for computer‑vision applications, enabling easy instantiation of standard or custom architectures and seamless integration with the Transformers library.", "keywords": ["ConvNeXTV2", "configuration", "model architecture", "hyperparameters", "vision model", "patch embedding", "stage depth", "hidden size", "activation function", "initialization", "layer normalization", "stochastic depth", "output features", "backbone"], "summary_hash": "44f2a006bff9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:03:55+00:00"}
