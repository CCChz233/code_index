{"summary": "The module defines a scenario class that orchestrates multiple model runs with varying assumptions about health‑system human‑resource capability expansion. It builds sets of parameter combinations, samples model inputs, records configuration metadata, and executes the full health‑system model to quantify the outcomes associated with each capability‑expansion scenario.", "business_intent": "To provide health‑policy analysts and planners with evidence on how different levels of health‑workforce capability growth affect system performance, enabling data‑driven decisions on resource allocation and strategic planning.", "keywords": ["health system modeling", "scenario analysis", "human resources capability expansion", "parameter sampling", "impact assessment", "policy evaluation", "simulation", "health workforce planning"], "summary_hash": "a8656d697280", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:58:57+00:00"}
