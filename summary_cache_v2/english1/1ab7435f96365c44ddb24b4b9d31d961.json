{"summary": "The module defines a container class that stores configurable scaling factors for key soil physical properties—soil moisture content, saturated hydraulic conductivity, pressure‑head related parameters, and perched water‑table base depth. Each factor is represented as an xarray DataArray indexed by land‑use subunits, allowing model components to retrieve and apply these adjustments during simulations.", "business_intent": "Enable users of the MSW (soil‑water) modeling package to customize and apply scaling adjustments to soil parameters across different land‑use categories, supporting flexible calibration and scenario analysis of hydrological processes.", "keywords": ["scaling factors", "soil moisture", "hydraulic conductivity", "pressure head", "perched water table", "land use", "xarray", "DataArray", "model configuration", "hydrological modeling"], "summary_hash": "6cd955008f6f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:44:29+00:00"}
