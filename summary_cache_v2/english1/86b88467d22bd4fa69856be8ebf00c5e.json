{"summary": "A training script that orchestrates distributed fine‑tuning of Stable Diffusion XL using LoRA adapters and the ORPO reinforcement learning objective. It handles argument parsing, dataset loading via WebDataset, image preprocessing, caption tokenization, model loading and checkpoint hooks, validation logging, and optional upload to the Hugging Face hub, leveraging Accelerate, WandB, and other utilities for scalable training.", "business_intent": "Provide a reproducible, scalable workflow for researchers and engineers to adapt large diffusion models to custom image‑text data with LoRA and ORPO, enabling efficient alignment and generation of high‑quality images while integrating experiment tracking and model publishing.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion XL", "LoRA", "ORPO", "diffusion training", "reinforcement learning", "WebDataset", "distributed training", "Accelerate", "WandB", "model fine‑tuning", "image generation", "Hugging Face hub"], "summary_hash": "236e5836ace0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:07:26+00:00"}
