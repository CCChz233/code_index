{"summary": "Implements a modular control network that can be attached to diffusion models to inject spatial and class conditioning. It builds a hierarchy of down‑sampling, residual, and attention blocks, optionally enhanced with transformer layers and spatial transformers, and produces control features that are merged with the main diffusion UNet during generation.", "business_intent": "Provide a plug‑in component for text‑to‑image diffusion pipelines that enables fine‑grained, controllable generation using auxiliary signals such as edges, depth, or segmentation, thereby improving creative control for content creation, design, and visual‑effects applications.", "keywords": ["control network", "diffusion model", "conditional guidance", "spatial transformer", "attention", "residual blocks", "class conditioning", "checkpointing", "flash attention", "UNet integration", "image synthesis"], "summary_hash": "a5f49faad1d4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:27:16+00:00"}
