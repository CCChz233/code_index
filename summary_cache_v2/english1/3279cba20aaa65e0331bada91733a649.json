{"summary": "The module defines a reusable quantum circuit component that implements a Boolean OR operation on a set of input qubits. It uses an open‑controlled multi‑X (MCX) construction with optional flags to invert or ignore particular inputs, and manages ancilla qubits as needed.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use, configurable quantum OR primitive for developers building quantum algorithms, enabling efficient embedding of classical logical decisions within reversible quantum circuits.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "OR operation", "boolean logic", "multi-controlled X", "ancilla register", "Qiskit", "reversible computing", "quantum algorithm"], "summary_hash": "24ca8bfda4e7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:11:38+00:00"}
