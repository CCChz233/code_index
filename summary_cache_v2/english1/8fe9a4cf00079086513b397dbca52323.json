{"summary": "A command‑line utility for configuring and launching the training of lightweight adapter modules that augment pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models using NVIDIA NeMo. It outlines usage patterns for standard adaptation, hyper‑parameter sweeps, and references fine‑tuning alternatives, while handling configuration updates and experiment management.", "business_intent": "Provide a streamlined way to adapt existing ASR models to new, low‑resource speech datasets by adding small adapter layers, thereby reducing training cost and time while maintaining performance, and supporting experiment tracking and hyper‑parameter optimization.", "keywords": ["ASR", "adapter training", "NeMo", "configuration", "hyperparameter search", "experiment manager", "pretrained model", "fine‑tuning"], "summary_hash": "e73ed2d126ff", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:39:27+00:00"}
