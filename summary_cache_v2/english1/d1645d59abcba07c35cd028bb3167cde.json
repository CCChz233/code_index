{"summary": "A fast test suite that validates the core functionality of an image‑to‑image diffusion pipeline. It supplies lightweight dummy components and inputs, then checks key behaviours such as attention slicing, half‑precision inference, batch‑vs‑single consistency, model serialization, optional component handling, and integration with xformers‑based attention.", "business_intent": "Provide rapid, reliable verification of the image‑to‑image generation pipeline for continuous integration and production readiness, ensuring performance optimisations and compatibility do not introduce regressions.", "keywords": ["image-to-image", "diffusion pipeline", "unit testing", "dummy components", "attention slicing", "float16", "half‑precision", "batch inference", "model save/load", "serialization", "optional components", "xformers attention", "fast CI tests"], "summary_hash": "de071274abdd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:10:55+00:00"}
