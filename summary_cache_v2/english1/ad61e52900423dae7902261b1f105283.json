{"summary": "The module implements a suite of PyTorch‑compatible data loading utilities for Deep Graph Library (DGL) graphs. It provides wrappers that convert graph samples into tensors, batch multiple graphs while preserving hierarchical structures, manage worker initialization and OpenMP threading, and enable prefetching and shared‑memory optimizations for low‑latency GPU training. It also includes support for distributed sampling and handling of feature storage columns.", "business_intent": "Facilitate high‑performance training of graph neural networks by integrating DGL graph datasets with PyTorch's DataLoader ecosystem, reducing data‑loading overhead, improving GPU utilization, and supporting scalable distributed training.", "keywords": ["DGL", "PyTorch", "DataLoader", "graph batching", "tensor conversion", "prefetching", "distributed sampling", "worker initialization", "GPU acceleration", "mini‑batch training", "graph neural networks"], "summary_hash": "ef652ac8955e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:36:06+00:00"}
