{"summary": "This module builds a library of elementary approximations for single‑qubit quantum gates using a discrete gate set. It provides utilities to validate candidate approximations, process search tree nodes, and generate the basic approximation set through various strategies such as greedy selection or kd‑tree lookup.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient quantum circuit compilation by supplying pre‑computed gate approximations required by the Solovay‑Kitaev algorithm, thereby improving synthesis speed and fidelity for quantum software.", "keywords": ["quantum computing", "gate synthesis", "Solovay‑Kitaev", "single‑qubit approximations", "discrete basis", "Qiskit", "gate sequence", "approximation generation", "kd‑tree", "greedy algorithm"], "summary_hash": "29882965876d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:58:33+00:00"}
