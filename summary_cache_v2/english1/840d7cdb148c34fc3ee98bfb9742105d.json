{"summary": "Implements a multi‑scale keypoint detector based on the Key.Net architecture, using learned CNN filters to locate distinctive image points. The detector can be initialized with pretrained weights, a configurable number of features, and optional modules for estimating local orientation and affine shape of each keypoint.", "business_intent": "Enable robust feature detection for downstream computer‑vision applications such as image matching, visual SLAM, and object recognition by providing high‑quality, scale‑aware keypoints with optional orientation and shape information.", "keywords": ["keypoint detection", "multi‑scale", "CNN", "pretrained model", "orientation estimation", "affine shape", "feature extraction", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "56fd279784fb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:43:33+00:00"}
