{"summary": "Defines a QuasiDistribution class that encapsulates quasiprobability data obtained from quantum circuit execution. It offers utilities for normalizing, converting to standard probability distributions, and performing arithmetic operations needed for quantum error mitigation and analysis of measurement outcomes.", "business_intent": "Enable users of the quantum computing framework to handle and manipulate quasidistributions resulting from noisy quantum measurements, facilitating post‑processing steps such as error mitigation, expectation value calculation, and conversion to conventional probability representations.", "keywords": ["quasidistribution", "quantum measurement", "error mitigation", "probability conversion", "Qiskit", "quantum result processing", "distribution arithmetic"], "summary_hash": "6d466cd7b080", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:01:38+00:00"}
