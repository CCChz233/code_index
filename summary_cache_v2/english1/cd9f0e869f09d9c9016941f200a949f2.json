{"summary": "This module implements readout error mitigation for quantum experiment results. It defines a common abstract base for mitigation, concrete strategies that treat qubits independently or account for correlated errors, and helper utilities for converting raw measurement counts into probability vectors, marginalizing data, and computing statistical quantities such as expectation values.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum users to obtain more accurate measurement outcomes by correcting systematic readout errors using calibration data, thereby improving the reliability of downstream analyses and algorithmic decisions.", "keywords": ["quantum computing", "readout error mitigation", "measurement correction", "calibration", "expectation value", "quasi‑probability distribution", "local mitigation", "correlated mitigation", "utility functions", "counts processing"], "summary_hash": "99ed481593e4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:05:17+00:00"}
