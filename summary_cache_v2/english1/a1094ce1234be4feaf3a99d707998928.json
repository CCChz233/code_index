{"summary": "This module defines structures for specifying and assembling the settings needed to execute a prediction operation within the Raster Vision framework. It offers a configuration container and a fluent builder that collect required inputs (data root, backend, experiment, scenes, task type), perform validation, and can serialize the configuration to protobuf or instantiate the corresponding command object.", "business_intent": "To streamline the setup and validation of prediction jobs in geospatial machine‑learning workflows, enabling users to reliably configure inference tasks and integrate them into automated pipelines.", "keywords": ["prediction", "command configuration", "builder pattern", "validation", "protobuf", "backend", "task type", "scenes", "experiment", "geospatial", "machine learning", "Raster Vision"], "summary_hash": "8776f010dc4d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:55:00+00:00"}
