{"summary": "The module implements a DGL‑based pipeline for the EEG‑GCNN approach, offering a dataset wrapper that converts EEG recordings into graph structures using pre‑computed spectral coherence as edge weights, and two graph convolutional neural network architectures (a shallow and a deep variant) that process the electrode‑node graphs to learn spatial patterns for brain‑signal classification.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to quickly prototype, train, and evaluate graph‑based deep learning models for EEG‑driven neurological disease diagnosis, supporting reproducible experiments and facilitating the creation of AI‑assisted diagnostic tools.", "keywords": ["EEG", "graph convolutional network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "brain signal classification", "neurological disease diagnosis", "spectral coherence", "graph dataset", "deep learning model", "graph pooling"], "summary_hash": "2c5f63d5858d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:54:41+00:00"}
