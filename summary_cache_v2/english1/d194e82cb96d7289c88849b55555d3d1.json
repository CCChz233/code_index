{"summary": "Provides the low‑level foreign function interface that connects Python code to DGL's compiled C++ runtime. It loads the native library, defines ctypes structures mirroring DGL objects, wraps backend functions with error checking, and implements core runtime abstractions such as NDArray, device contexts, and stream handles.", "business_intent": "Enable Python applications to leverage DGL's high‑performance graph processing and neural network kernels implemented in native code, ensuring efficient data exchange, tensor management, and execution control across language boundaries.", "keywords": ["FFI", "ctypes", "DGL", "runtime", "C API", "shared library", "NDArray", "tensor adaptor", "device context", "stream handling", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "60de94cea195", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:58:40+00:00"}
