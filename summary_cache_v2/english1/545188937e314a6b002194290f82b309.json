{"summary": "This module implements a collection of mathematical window generators for signal processing, providing GPU‑accelerated equivalents of common window shapes such as triangular, cosine‑based, and tapered windows. The functions return one‑dimensional arrays suitable for weighting data before spectral analysis.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑performance, GPU‑based preparation of data for Fourier transforms and other spectral methods by supplying standard windowing functions within the CuPy ecosystem.", "keywords": ["window functions", "signal processing", "GPU acceleration", "CuPy", "numpy compatibility", "spectral analysis", "Fourier transform", "array generation"], "summary_hash": "f84e91b899f3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:18:45+00:00"}
