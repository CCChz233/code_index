{"summary": "DiceLoss computes the average Dice coefficient loss between predicted tensors and ground‑truth masks, supporting both multi‑class and multi‑label segmentation. It handles logits or probability inputs, applies optional sigmoid/softmax or custom activation, and uses smoothing terms to stabilize the intersection‑over‑union calculation.", "business_intent": "Offer a robust, differentiable loss function for training deep neural networks on segmentation tasks, especially in medical imaging where precise overlap measurement between predictions and annotations is essential.", "keywords": ["dice loss", "segmentation", "multi‑class", "multi‑label", "smooth intersection", "logits", "probabilities", "sigmoid", "softmax", "activation", "loss function", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "8be2d9f0a2ac", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:26:50+00:00"}
