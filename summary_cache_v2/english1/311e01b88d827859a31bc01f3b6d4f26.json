{"summary": "A suite of PyTorch Lightning callbacks that augment NeMo model training with performance‑optimizing and reliability features. The callbacks handle CUDA‑graph recording for fast iteration execution, distributed checkpoint I/O using appropriate storage backends, automatic serialization of NeMo models into .nemo files with metric‑based selection and EMA support, and graceful handling of pre‑emptions during training.", "business_intent": "Enable large‑scale, high‑performance training of NeMo speech and language models by simplifying graph execution, ensuring robust checkpointing across distributed environments, and providing resilience to interruptions, thereby reducing engineering effort and improving training efficiency.", "keywords": ["PyTorch Lightning", "CUDA graph", "distributed checkpoint", "TensorStore", "NeMo model checkpoint", "exponential moving average", "preemption handling", "mixed precision", "training lifecycle", "scalable training"], "summary_hash": "3649dec34e8f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:00:46+00:00"}
