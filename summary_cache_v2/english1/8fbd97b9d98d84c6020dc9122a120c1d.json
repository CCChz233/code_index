{"summary": "The package implements a complete workflow for N-body physics simulation using graph neural networks. It generates particle trajectories, converts them into graph representations, provides dataset handling and collating utilities, defines interaction‑network and related models, and includes a training script that can run on CPU/GPU, evaluate performance, and optionally create visualizations of the simulated dynamics.", "business_intent": "To serve as a reference implementation and benchmark for researchers and engineers exploring graph‑based deep learning on physical systems, enabling rapid experimentation with Interaction Network models and related architectures on synthetic N-body data.", "keywords": ["N-body simulation", "graph neural network", "Interaction Network", "PyTorch", "DGL", "physics modeling", "dataset generation", "training script", "visualization", "machine learning"], "summary_hash": "1db054b0284d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:55:00+00:00"}
