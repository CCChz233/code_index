{"summary": "This module defines a comprehensive inference pipeline for the Flux text‑to‑image diffusion model. It orchestrates prompt tokenization with CLIP and T5, prepares latent representations, runs the conditional transformer denoising loop using a flow‑match scheduler, and decodes the final latents into images via a VAE. The pipeline also supports advanced options such as VAE slicing/tiling, guidance scaling, LoRA/PEFT weight handling, and runtime interruption handling.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and enterprises to generate high‑quality images from textual descriptions using the state‑of‑the‑art Flux diffusion model, providing a flexible and configurable API for integration into creative, marketing, design, and AI‑augmented content generation applications.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "text-to-image", "Flux", "pipeline", "CLIP", "T5", "VAE", "scheduler", "inference", "latent", "guidance scaling", "LoRA", "PEFT", "image generation", "AI art"], "summary_hash": "04badd9cc67c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:19:38+00:00"}
