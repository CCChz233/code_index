{"summary": "The module defines a flexible Squeeze‑and‑Excitation residual network class that can construct stacks of bottleneck blocks with channel‑wise attention for arbitrary spatial dimensions, channel configurations, group convolutions, dropout, and layer depths. It also provides concrete model variants (e.g., SENet154, SE‑ResNet‑50/101/152, SE‑ResNeXt‑50/101) that wrap the generic class with preset parameters and optionally load pretrained 2‑D weights. The models output both feature maps and classification logits, supporting typical MONAI use‑cases such as medical image analysis.", "business_intent": "Offer ready‑to‑use, high‑performance convolutional neural network architectures enhanced by squeeze‑and‑excitation mechanisms for medical imaging and related deep‑learning applications, while allowing customization and leveraging pretrained weights to accelerate development and improve accuracy.", "keywords": ["squeeze-and-excitation", "residual network", "SE-ResNet", "SE-ResNeXt", "pretrained weights", "feature extraction", "classification", "configurable architecture", "PyTorch", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "8187bbe2a248", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:17:04+00:00"}
