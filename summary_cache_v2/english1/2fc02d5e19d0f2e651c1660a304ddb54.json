{"summary": "The module defines a suite of dictionary‑compatible transform classes that wrap MONAI’s low‑level utility operations (e.g., channel handling, intensity statistics, image filtering, format conversion, random augmentations). Each wrapper extracts specified keys from a data dictionary, applies the underlying array‑based transform, and writes the result back while preserving or updating metadata and optionally handling missing entries.", "business_intent": "Enable developers of medical imaging pipelines to incorporate common preprocessing, augmentation, and analysis steps directly on dictionary‑structured datasets without manual extraction or re‑assembly of tensors, thereby simplifying workflow construction, improving code reuse, and ensuring consistent metadata handling.", "keywords": ["dictionary transform", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "preprocessing", "augmentation", "metadata handling", "wrapper", "utility functions", "tensor conversion", "image statistics"], "summary_hash": "5e6ccebdf656", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:23:06+00:00"}
