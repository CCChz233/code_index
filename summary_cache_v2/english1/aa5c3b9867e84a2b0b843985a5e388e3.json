{"summary": "A PyTorch Lightning strategy that extends the default Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) plugin to support model‑parallel architectures. It manages device placement, configures NCCL communication (including optional SHARP acceleration), controls DDP communication hooks for AMP‑O2 with FP32 gradient accumulation, and provides robust checkpoint handling in distributed environments.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to train large, model‑parallel neural networks efficiently on multi‑GPU clusters by offering a customizable DDP backend that handles low‑level communication settings, device consistency, and reliable distributed checkpointing.", "keywords": ["PyTorch Lightning", "Distributed Data Parallel", "model parallel", "NCCL", "SHARP", "AMP-O2", "gradient accumulation", "communication hook", "distributed checkpointing", "GPU training"], "summary_hash": "1821553f7f33", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:41:33+00:00"}
