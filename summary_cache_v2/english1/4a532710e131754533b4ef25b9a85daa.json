{"summary": "BaseOrchestrationRule is an abstract asynchronous context manager that encapsulates a discrete piece of orchestration logic for a state transition. It receives an orchestration context together with the initial and intended state types, and provides lifecycle hooks to mutate the proposed state before validation, act on the validated state, and clean up side effects. By nesting multiple rule instances, complex transition policies can be composed in a modular fashion.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, composable mechanism for developers to enforce validation, side‑effects, and cleanup around flow or task state transitions in Prefect, ensuring that each transition is governed consistently before being persisted.", "keywords": ["orchestration", "state transition", "context manager", "hooks", "validation", "side effects", "Prefect", "rule composition", "async", "abstract base class"], "summary_hash": "8107e04e5ab5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:46:15+00:00"}
