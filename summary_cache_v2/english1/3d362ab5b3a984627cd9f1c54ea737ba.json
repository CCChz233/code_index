{"summary": "The kedro/io package implements the core data I/O framework for Kedro, defining abstract dataset contracts, version handling, and catalog operations, while providing utilities for configuration resolution and a suite of dataset implementations (cached, in‑memory, shared‑memory, lambda, etc.). It enables consistent, version‑aware loading and saving of data assets through a centralized, dictionary‑like catalog.", "business_intent": "To give Kedro users a flexible, extensible system for managing data assets in pipelines, supporting version control, configurable dataset definitions, and interchangeable storage backends, thereby simplifying data engineering and machine‑learning workflow orchestration.", "keywords": ["Kedro", "data catalog", "dataset", "versioning", "I/O", "configuration", "caching", "in‑memory", "shared memory", "lambda dataset", "pipeline"], "summary_hash": "ca9d1a32c906", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:22:40+00:00"}
