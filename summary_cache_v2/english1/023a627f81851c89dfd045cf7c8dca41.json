{"summary": "The class encapsulates a metric that quantifies how correct a generated answer is relative to a reference answer by blending factual accuracy and semantic similarity. It stores configuration such as a name, weighting factors for the two components, and an AnswerSimilarity helper. Internally it prepares simplified statements, checks statement presence, and computes per‑turn scores that are aggregated into a final correctness score.", "business_intent": "Provide a standardized, weighted evaluation of answer quality for natural‑language QA or conversational AI systems, enabling developers to assess and compare model outputs against ground‑truth answers.", "keywords": ["answer correctness", "factuality", "semantic similarity", "evaluation metric", "ground truth", "weighting", "answer similarity", "scoring"], "summary_hash": "023e964380c0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:44:32+00:00"}
