It generates random homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, applies partitioning, loads partition data and books, and checks that node and edge assignments, masks, data types, formats, and features are correctly preserved across partitions.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the correctness and robustness of DGL's distributed graph partitioning functionality, ensuring that both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs can be partitioned, stored, and retrieved accurately for large‑scale graph processing workloads.", "keywords": ["DGL", "distributed", "graph partitioning", "unit tests", "heterogeneous graph", "RangePartitionBook", "node masks", "edge masks", "feature verification", "data type validation"], "summary_hash": "40a643522d82", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:06:56+00:00"}
