{"summary": "The package offers a complete example of building and training a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with DGL's MXNet backend. It defines the GAT model, loads citation graph datasets, applies multi‑head attention with sparse matrix‑vector multiplication for efficiency, and runs a training loop with validation, testing, and early‑stopping support.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate how to implement and train a GAT model on standard citation benchmarks using MXNet, providing a reference implementation for researchers and developers interested in graph neural networks and performance‑optimized attention mechanisms.", "keywords": ["Graph Attention Network", "GAT", "DGL", "MXNet", "node classification", "citation graphs", "sparse matrix multiplication", "multi‑head attention", "early stopping", "training pipeline"], "summary_hash": "4a54332e6215", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:50:08+00:00"}
