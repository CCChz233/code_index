{"summary": "This test module validates the bladder cancer simulation model by configuring various population prevalence and incidence scenarios, adjusting cancer onset and progression rates, and assessing the impact of different treatment effectiveness levels. It runs simulations with and without health system components to verify that disease progression, treatment blocking, and health‑seeking behavior operate as expected.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that the bladder cancer component of the health simulation framework accurately reflects disease dynamics and treatment outcomes across diverse configurations, thereby supporting reliable epidemiological analysis and policy evaluation.", "keywords": ["bladder cancer", "simulation testing", "prevalence", "incidence", "disease progression", "treatment effectiveness", "health system integration", "TLO framework", "pytest", "population configuration"], "summary_hash": "02f6994085cb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:45:52+00:00"}
