{"summary": "Implements the Smooth‑AP loss for metric‑learning models. It accepts a batch of feature embeddings organized with an equal number of samples per class, treats each embedding as a query, computes a smoothed average‑precision score against the rest of the batch using a temperature‑controlled sigmoid, and returns the mean score as a scalar loss.", "business_intent": "Provides a differentiable ranking loss that can be used to train neural networks for image or document retrieval, face recognition, and other similarity‑based applications, aiming to improve retrieval accuracy by directly optimizing average precision.", "keywords": ["Smooth-AP", "loss function", "metric learning", "ranking", "deep embedding", "PyTorch", "temperature annealing", "average precision", "retrieval", "batch sampling"], "summary_hash": "1cb1f62d4e39", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:25:22+00:00"}
