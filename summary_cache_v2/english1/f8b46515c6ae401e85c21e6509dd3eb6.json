{"summary": "This module provides a collection of dictionary‑compatible post‑processing transforms for MONAI. It wraps core post‑processing operations—such as activation functions, discretization, distance transforms, ensemble aggregation, label filtering, contour extraction, Sobel gradients, and morphological cleanup—so they can be applied directly to dictionary entries (e.g., image tensors, segmentation masks) while preserving metadata and handling missing keys gracefully.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless integration of post‑processing steps into MONAI data pipelines, allowing users to convert raw model outputs into clean, usable segmentation masks or probability maps within dictionary‑based workflows, facilitating deployment in medical imaging applications.", "keywords": ["post‑processing", "dictionary wrapper", "activation", "discretization", "distance transform", "ensemble", "label filtering", "contour extraction", "Sobel gradient", "morphological cleanup", "medical imaging", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "5bd1163d6a55", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:30:28+00:00"}
