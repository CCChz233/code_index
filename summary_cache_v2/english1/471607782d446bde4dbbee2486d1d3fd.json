{"summary": "The module supplies a set of load‑testing tools that generate large volumes of concurrent OpenAI‑style completion requests through the LiteLLM router (including its proxy and queuing layers). It records response times, success/failure counts, and other performance indicators to assess latency, throughput, queuing behavior, and error handling under stress.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and operations teams to benchmark, validate, and tune the LiteLLM router's scalability and reliability before deploying it in production environments.", "keywords": ["load testing", "concurrency", "latency measurement", "LiteLLM router", "performance metrics", "queuing behavior", "error handling", "OpenAI API", "stress testing", "benchmarking"], "summary_hash": "2c5c33c0d606", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:02:03+00:00"}
