{"summary": "Implements a topology‑adaptive graph convolution layer that aggregates node features from up to K hops using the symmetrically normalized adjacency matrix, applies separate learnable linear transformations for each hop, and optionally adds bias and a non‑linear activation.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable neural‑network component for graph‑structured data that captures multi‑hop neighborhood information, facilitating the construction of graph neural networks for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph‑level inference in domains like social networks, recommendation systems, and molecular modeling.", "keywords": ["graph convolution", "topology adaptive", "multi‑hop aggregation", "normalized adjacency", "learnable weights per hop", "bias", "activation", "graph neural network layer", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "281540cd79d2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:52:50+00:00"}
