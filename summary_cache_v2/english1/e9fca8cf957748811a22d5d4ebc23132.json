{"summary": "A collection of command‑line benchmark programs that exercise Arkouda’s distributed array and DataFrame functionality across a wide range of operations—creation, I/O, arithmetic reductions, scans, sorts, set and group‑by operations, string handling, and memory‑bandwidth tests. Each script parses user options, generates synthetic data, runs the corresponding Arkouda routine (often alongside a NumPy or pandas reference), measures execution time, optionally checks result correctness, and reports the performance metrics.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and performance engineers to quantify the speed, scalability, and correctness of Arkouda’s parallel data‑processing primitives relative to familiar single‑node libraries, thereby guiding optimization, capacity planning, and feature validation for large‑scale analytics workloads.", "keywords": ["benchmarking", "performance measurement", "Arkoud a", "distributed arrays", "command‑line tools", "I/O latency", "sorting", "aggregation", "set operations", "group‑by", "string processing", "STREAM benchmark", "NumPy comparison", "pandas comparison", "Parquet", "correctness verification", "scalability"], "summary_hash": "5a14b21de351", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:24:10+00:00"}
