{"summary": "This module supplies shared utilities for Amazon Bedrock integrations, including configuration objects for different model families (e.g., AI21, Anthropic, Cohere, Llama, Mistral, Titan), a global Bedrock configuration, a custom exception type, and a response iterator that supports synchronous and asynchronous consumption of model outputs. It also contains lightweight helper functions for header handling, callbacks, and client initialization.", "business_intent": "Standardize and simplify the setup, parameter handling, and error management for invoking Amazon Bedrock language, embedding, and image generation models within the Litellm framework.", "keywords": ["Amazon Bedrock", "configuration", "model parameters", "error handling", "response iterator", "LLM", "embeddings", "image generation", "utility functions", "client initialization"], "summary_hash": "b5b9b6e975ba", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:56:20+00:00"}
