{"summary": "Utility module that implements lazy deserialization of PyTorch checkpoints. It defines a custom unpickler that resolves class references and persistent objects only when accessed, and a proxy object that represents tensors whose data is loaded on demand. Helper functions coordinate loading of distributed checkpoints, extracting tensors, materializing them, and moving state dictionaries into model structures.", "business_intent": "Enable fast and memory‑efficient loading of large model checkpoints, particularly in distributed training scenarios, by postponing tensor materialization until required.", "keywords": ["lazy loading", "checkpoint", "tensor proxy", "unpickler", "distributed training", "state dict", "PyTorch", "serialization", "deserialization", "memory efficiency"], "summary_hash": "ab5dfd46b307", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:03:27+00:00"}
