{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests for the MODFLOW‑6 regrid scheme implementations. It parametrizes a collection of regrid method classes, checks that each correctly resolves to the expected regridder type, and validates that improper configurations raise appropriate validation errors. The file also provides lightweight helper utilities for constructing regrid objects and computing geometric helpers such as barycentric coordinates and centroids used in the tests.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability of the regrid scheme abstractions by automatically verifying correct type mapping and error handling, thereby supporting accurate spatial interpolation of model parameters in groundwater simulations.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW 6", "regrid schemes", "unit testing", "parameterization", "validation", "pydantic", "geometric helpers", "barycentric coordinates", "centroid calculation", "software quality"], "summary_hash": "ac59b03b7d9a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:52:57+00:00"}
