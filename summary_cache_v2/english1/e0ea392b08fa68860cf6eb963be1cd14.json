{"summary": "This module implements the MixHop graph neural network layer and its convolutional variant, supporting multi‑hop neighbor aggregation, optional dropout, batch normalization, and activation. It also provides a command‑line entry point to train and evaluate the MixHop model on full‑graph citation datasets such as Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed using PyTorch and DGL.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and practitioners to experiment with and benchmark the MixHop architecture for node classification tasks on standard citation graphs, facilitating performance comparison and further development of multi‑hop graph neural networks.", "keywords": ["MixHop", "graph neural network", "multi‑hop aggregation", "node classification", "citation datasets", "PyTorch", "DGL", "graph convolution", "training script"], "summary_hash": "ee2ec0514af4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:20:46+00:00"}
