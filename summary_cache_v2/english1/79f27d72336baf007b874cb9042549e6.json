{"summary": "Encapsulates the decoding process for an RNN‑Transducer model, coordinating the decoder and joint networks with an encoder state. It supports multiple strategies (greedy, beam, TSD, ALS‑D), configurable beam parameters, token‑set generation, alignment tracking, and extensive confidence‑score computation (frame, token, word) using various entropy or max‑probability methods. Helper utilities translate token IDs into readable strings or language representations.", "business_intent": "Provide a configurable, production‑ready decoding engine for speech‑recognition systems that need accurate transcription, confidence metrics, and alignment data across different decoding strategies.", "keywords": ["RNN‑Transducer", "decoding", "beam search", "greedy decoding", "confidence scoring", "alignment preservation", "speech recognition", "inference configuration", "token to string conversion", "joint network"], "summary_hash": "a8e2fa774939", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:32:29+00:00"}
