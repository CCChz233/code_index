{"summary": "A foundational data model class extending Pydantic's BaseModel to act as the common ancestor for all Prefect schema objects. It gracefully ignores unknown fields in production to maintain forward compatibility, while enforcing strict field validation in test mode, and offers utilities for copying, serializing, and resetting model data.", "business_intent": "Provide a consistent, resilient model layer for Prefect API interactions that tolerates newer payload fields in production yet catches unintended schema changes during testing.", "keywords": ["pydantic", "base model", "schema", "extra fields", "forward compatibility", "test mode", "copy", "serialization", "reset", "Prefect"], "summary_hash": "5c706d1300a9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:01:35+00:00"}
