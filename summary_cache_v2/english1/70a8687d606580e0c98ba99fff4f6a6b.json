{"summary": "The module provides example scripts that implement the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement‑learning algorithm using Lightning Fabric. It demonstrates how to set up environments, initialise agents, run distributed training loops (both with the environment coupled to the agent and with a decoupled player‑trainer architecture), log metrics to TensorBoard, capture videos, and evaluate performance. A reference PyTorch‑only version is also included for comparison.", "business_intent": "Showcase the use of Lightning Fabric to accelerate and scale PPO training, give developers ready‑to‑run examples of distributed reinforcement‑learning pipelines, and illustrate best practices for logging, checkpointing, and flexible deployment across CPUs and GPUs.", "keywords": ["PPO", "reinforcement learning", "Lightning Fabric", "distributed training", "PyTorch", "Gymnasium", "DDP", "TensorBoard", "video rendering", "coupled architecture", "decoupled architecture"], "summary_hash": "de68d0b7cc13", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:11:51+00:00"}
