It also provides a generic fallback exception class for cases where the original server‑side exception type is unavailable on the client.", "business_intent": "To preserve and convey detailed error information from remote code execution back to the originating workflow, enabling accurate debugging and consistent error handling in distributed or sandboxed environments.", "keywords": ["exception serialization", "remote error propagation", "metaclass", "fallback exception", "distributed workflow", "traceback handling", "environment isolation"], "summary_hash": "c54f1a2e38f8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:12:31+00:00"}
