{"summary": "The module defines a scenario that runs the disease model under a range of health‑system configurations. It builds sets of alternative parameter values, combines them with the baseline (status‑quo) settings, executes the model (locally or via batch submission), and records the outcomes to quantify the impact of each health‑system assumption relative to a no‑system reference.", "business_intent": "To quantify how different health‑system assumptions affect modelled health outcomes, providing evidence for policymakers and researchers on the potential value of health‑system interventions compared with the absence of such a system.", "keywords": ["health system", "scenario analysis", "model simulation", "parameter sampling", "impact assessment", "policy evaluation", "batch execution", "baseline comparison"], "summary_hash": "4f9c645652c4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:56:09+00:00"}
