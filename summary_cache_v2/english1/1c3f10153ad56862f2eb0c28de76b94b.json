{"summary": "A test suite that verifies the automatic detection, registration, and ordering of method module dependencies within the simulation framework. It checks that required and optional dependencies are correctly identified, that modules are topologically sorted, and that appropriate errors are raised for missing or circular dependencies, while also confirming successful initialization and simulation runs.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the robustness and correctness of the framework's module dependency management, preventing runtime failures and ensuring that disease, birth, and other method modules are loaded in the proper sequence for accurate simulation outcomes.", "keywords": ["module dependencies", "topological sort", "registration", "simulation", "error handling", "circular dependency", "missing dependency", "initialization", "testing", "tlo"], "summary_hash": "6a45ca9a3bf6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:43:18+00:00"}
