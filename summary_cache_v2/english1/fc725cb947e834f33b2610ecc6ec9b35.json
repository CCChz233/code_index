{"summary": "A collection of unit tests that verify the correctness, stability, and edge‑case handling of the CTC, RNNT, and graph‑based transducer loss implementations in the k2 backend of the NeMo automatic speech recognition library. The tests cover a wide range of tensor shapes, device configurations, schema definitions, and special conditions such as infinite penalties and composition equivalence.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability and accuracy of ASR loss functions for production deployments, prevent regressions, and ensure consistent behavior across hardware platforms.", "keywords": ["ASR", "k2", "CTC loss", "RNNT loss", "graph transducer", "unit tests", "tensor dimensions", "device configurations", "NeMo", "automatic speech recognition"], "summary_hash": "65515f0b1419", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:54:51+00:00"}
