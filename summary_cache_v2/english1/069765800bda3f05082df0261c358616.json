{"summary": "Implements a dataset class that loads the QM9 molecular benchmark as a collection of DGL graphs, where each graph encodes atoms as nodes, chemical bonds as edges, 3‑D coordinates, atom and bond feature vectors, and up to 19 quantum‑chemical regression targets. The class manages downloading, extracting, caching, preprocessing, optional target selection, and user‑defined graph transformations.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and developers with an out‑of‑the‑box, efficiently preprocessed QM9 dataset for training and evaluating graph neural network models on quantum‑chemical property regression tasks.", "keywords": ["QM9", "molecular graphs", "graph neural networks", "DGL", "regression dataset", "atom features", "bond features", "3D coordinates", "dataset download", "preprocessing", "target selection", "graph transformation"], "summary_hash": "70fd7b7cbdf7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:39:24+00:00"}
