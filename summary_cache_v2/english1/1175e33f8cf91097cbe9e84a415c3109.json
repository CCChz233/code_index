{"summary": "This module provides a unittest suite that exercises the RandGibbsNoise transform with various synthetic 2D and 3D images. It verifies correct probability handling, proper scaling of the alpha parameter, identity behavior when the transform is disabled, and deterministic output consistency across runs.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and reproducibility of the random Gibbs noise augmentation used in medical imaging pipelines, ensuring reliable preprocessing for downstream deep learning models.", "keywords": ["RandGibbsNoise", "unit test", "probability", "alpha parameter", "determinism", "synthetic images", "2D", "3D", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "augmentation"], "summary_hash": "ce9d1ee74f48", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:58:22+00:00"}
