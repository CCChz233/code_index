{"summary": "The module implements a set of driver classes that orchestrate the creation of meteorological visualisations (horizontal, vertical and linear sections) from ECMWF NetCDF forecast files. It provides an abstract base for loading and preparing data, handling time and level dimensions, performing interpolation, configuring plot parameters and dispatching to registered rendering routines.", "business_intent": "Enable a web‑map service to deliver on‑demand forecast plots for users, by abstracting the data extraction and preparation steps required to generate accurate horizontal, vertical and linear section graphics from large NetCDF datasets.", "keywords": ["meteorology", "ECMWF", "NetCDF", "plot driver", "horizontal section", "vertical section", "linear section", "data interpolation", "time handling", "elevation", "WMS", "MSS", "visualisation"], "summary_hash": "a5bc4fd61b7e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:47:19+00:00"}
