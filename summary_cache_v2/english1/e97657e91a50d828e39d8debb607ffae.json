{"summary": "The module implements a collection of neural network layers and utilities for building time‑delay neural network (TDNN) based acoustic models. It provides a 1‑D convolutional TDNN layer with optional padding, a compact squeeze‑excitation TDNN block, statistical and attentive pooling layers that aggregate temporal features (including masked mean/std computation), and helper functions for generating sequence masks and extracting masked statistics.", "business_intent": "Supply reusable, high‑performance components for constructing speech‑recognition acoustic models that require efficient temporal convolutions, channel‑wise attention, and robust pooling over variable‑length audio sequences.", "keywords": ["TDNN", "time-delay neural network", "squeeze‑excitation", "attentive pooling", "statistical pooling", "speech recognition", "acoustic modeling", "masking", "PyTorch", "neural network layer"], "summary_hash": "d2114d7d775d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:15:21+00:00"}
