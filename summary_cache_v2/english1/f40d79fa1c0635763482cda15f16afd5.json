{"summary": "A PyTorch/DGL example that implements and runs a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN). It provides model components with semantic and multi‑head graph attention across meta‑paths, utilities for loading and preprocessing heterogeneous graph datasets, scripts for full‑batch and mini‑batch (sampling‑based) training with early stopping, and evaluation of node classification using F1 scores.", "business_intent": "To supply a reproducible reference implementation of HAN for researchers and developers, enabling benchmarking on heterogeneous graph datasets and serving as a baseline for further experimentation or deployment of graph attention models.", "keywords": ["heterogeneous graph", "graph attention network", "HAN", "DGL", "PyTorch", "semantic attention", "meta‑path", "node classification", "sampling", "early stopping", "F1 score"], "summary_hash": "09f402f2344c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:51:42+00:00"}
