{"summary": "The module implements a training callback that continuously monitors a selected metric during model training, detects sudden spikes based on absolute and relative tolerances against a moving average, aborts the training run by raising a dedicated exception, and logs the problematic batch indices to a file for later exclusion when training is resumed.", "business_intent": "To safeguard training pipelines from destabilizing metric anomalies, reduce wasted computational resources, and enable seamless recovery by automatically skipping corrupted batches, thereby improving model reliability and training efficiency.", "keywords": ["spike detection", "training callback", "metric monitoring", "moving average", "tolerance thresholds", "abort training", "exception handling", "batch exclusion", "resume training", "Lightning Fabric", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "a7ca4ce7fa39", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:03:15+00:00"}
