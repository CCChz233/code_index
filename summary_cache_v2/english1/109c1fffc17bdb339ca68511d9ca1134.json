{"summary": "This module provides dataset and processing utilities for zero‑shot intent recognition using a natural‑language‑inference (NLI) approach. It includes a training dataset class that lets users map arbitrary file columns to premise, hypothesis, and label fields, an inference dataset class that builds premise‑hypothesis pairs from user utterances and candidate intent labels, and a processor that loads and preprocesses entailment datasets to supply training and validation examples along with the intent label set. Additionally, it offers a helper to compute class weights from a data loader for handling class imbalance.", "business_intent": "Enable rapid development and deployment of intent classification in conversational AI systems without requiring manually labeled intent data, by leveraging NLI models trained on entailment datasets and providing ready‑to‑use data pipelines for training and inference.", "keywords": ["zero‑shot intent recognition", "natural language inference", "dataset", "training data preparation", "inference data preparation", "processor", "class weight calculation", "tokenization", "GLUE", "intent classification", "conversational AI"], "summary_hash": "c9de9c025f0d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:09:28+00:00"}
