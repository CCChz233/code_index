{"summary": "The module provides example scripts that demonstrate how to build and use speech translation pipelines with NVIDIA NeMo. One script shows how to configure and launch training of a speech‑to‑text transformer model for speech translation, handling dataset manifests, tokenization, optimizer settings, distributed training, and experiment logging. The other script illustrates an end‑to‑end translation workflow by loading a pretrained ASR model, transcribing audio, and feeding the transcription into a translation component to produce output in a target language.", "business_intent": "Offer reference implementations that help researchers and engineers quickly prototype, train, and deploy speech translation systems using NeMo, thereby promoting adoption of the toolkit and accelerating development of multilingual speech applications.", "keywords": ["speech translation", "ASR", "transformer", "model training", "inference", "NeMo", "Hydra configuration", "distributed training", "experiment logging", "audio transcription", "language translation", "example scripts"], "summary_hash": "c685794d2eb2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:57:38+00:00"}
