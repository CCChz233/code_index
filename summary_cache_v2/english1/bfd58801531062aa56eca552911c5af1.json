{"summary": "This module implements a reverse diffusion scheduler for DDIM models. It defines a configurable scheduler that steps backward through diffusion timesteps to reconstruct the original latent noise from a generated sample, handling beta schedules, alpha values, clipping, and optional signal‑to‑noise rescaling. It also provides a lightweight output container for the step results and utility helpers for beta computation and SNR adjustment.", "business_intent": "Enable generative AI applications to invert DDIM diffusion processes, allowing analysis, debugging, or manipulation of latent representations by recovering the initial noise from generated outputs.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "DDIM", "inverse scheduler", "reverse diffusion", "latent noise", "beta schedule", "timesteps", "scheduler", "denoising", "machine learning", "generative models", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "020d7326d478", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:13:29+00:00"}
