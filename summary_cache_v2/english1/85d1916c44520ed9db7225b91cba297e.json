{"summary": "A configuration container that defines all architectural and training hyperparameters for a UDOP encoder‑decoder model, including token vocabulary size, transformer dimensions, attention settings, relative bias specifications, dropout, layer normalization, feed‑forward type, and vision encoder parameters such as image and patch size. It inherits from PretrainedConfig and provides a ready‑to‑use default matching the microsoft/udop-large model.", "business_intent": "Allows developers to customize and instantiate UDOP models for document understanding and multimodal tasks, supporting fine‑tuning, deployment, and reproducible model creation across different environments.", "keywords": ["UDOP", "configuration", "transformer", "encoder-decoder", "vision encoder", "document understanding", "hyperparameters", "pretrained model", "relative attention", "feed forward", "image size", "patch size"], "summary_hash": "ac057d7239f3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:02:30+00:00"}
