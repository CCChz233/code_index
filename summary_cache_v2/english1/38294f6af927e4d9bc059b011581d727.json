{"summary": "The module implements a deep generative graph model using PyTorch and DGL. It defines neural components for graph propagation, embedding, and sequential actions such as adding nodes, adding edges, and selecting destinations, and provides training and inference routines with probability calculations and weight initialization.", "business_intent": "To enable automated generation and modeling of complex graph structures (e.g., molecular or network graphs) for research and applications in chemistry, biology, and network design, facilitating data‑driven discovery and design workflows.", "keywords": ["deep generative graph model", "graph neural network", "PyTorch", "DGL", "graph generation", "node addition", "edge addition", "graph embedding", "probabilistic modeling"], "summary_hash": "7091ca5d40f1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:24:19+00:00"}
