{"summary": "A configuration container for the CTRL language model that holds all architectural hyperparameters such as vocabulary size, maximum sequence length, embedding dimensions, feed‑forward size, number of transformer layers and attention heads, dropout rates, layer‑norm epsilon, weight initializer range, and cache usage. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate a CTRL model with the desired architecture.", "business_intent": "Provide developers a simple, reproducible way to customize and instantiate CTRL transformer models by specifying model architecture parameters, enabling seamless integration with the Transformers library for training or inference.", "keywords": ["CTRL", "configuration", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "embedding dimension", "feed‑forward network", "layers", "attention heads", "dropout", "layer normalization", "initializer", "cache", "pretrained config"], "summary_hash": "4d41e5fd4f07", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:33:45+00:00"}
