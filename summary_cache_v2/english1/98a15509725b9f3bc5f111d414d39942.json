{"summary": "The package gathers and re‑exports a set of modular building blocks for constructing transformer‑based neural networks. It includes custom activation layers, flexible multi‑head attention with configurable mechanisms, unified input projection utilities, patch‑to‑token embedding helpers, residual and reversible connection tools, and a simplicial embedding component, all designed for efficient integration with PyTorch.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with ready‑to‑use, high‑performance components that simplify the design, experimentation, and deployment of transformer models across vision and language tasks.", "keywords": ["transformer", "activation", "attention", "multi‑head", "projection", "patch embedding", "residual", "reversible", "simplicial embedding", "PyTorch", "modular"], "summary_hash": "8fd6b80e4123", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:34:23+00:00"}
