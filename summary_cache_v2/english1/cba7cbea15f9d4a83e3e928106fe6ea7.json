{"summary": "The module supplies a suite of profiling utilities for MONAI workflows. It defines reusable context managers that capture elapsed time for arbitrary code blocks, function calls, and iterable generation, aggregating timing data via a multiprocessing queue and trace hooks. It also offers an Ignite Engine hook to record durations between configurable events and a high‑level workflow profiler that can output summarized statistics in multiple formats.", "business_intent": "To provide developers and researchers with tools to monitor and analyze the performance of medical imaging deep‑learning pipelines, facilitating bottleneck identification, resource utilization assessment, and overall optimization of MONAI applications.", "keywords": ["profiling", "performance measurement", "context manager", "timing", "trace hooks", "multiprocessing", "Ignite integration", "workflow analysis", "execution time", "deep learning", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "b2844bccaf5e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:05:29+00:00"}
