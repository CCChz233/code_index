{"summary": "A Keras layer that reshapes any input tensor into a two‑dimensional tensor of shape (batch, features), preserving the batch dimension. It respects the specified data format (channels_last or channels_first) and adds a singleton channel dimension when the input lacks a feature axis.", "business_intent": "Enables conversion of multi‑dimensional feature maps or sequences into flat vectors so they can be fed into dense layers or other operations that require a 2‑D input, simplifying model construction.", "keywords": ["flatten", "reshape", "tensor", "batch size", "channels_last", "channels_first", "Keras layer", "feature vector"], "summary_hash": "06829b9af32b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:57:09+00:00"}
