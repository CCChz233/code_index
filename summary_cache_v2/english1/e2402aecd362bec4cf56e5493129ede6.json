{"summary": "Implements the AdamW optimization algorithm, an adaptive stochastic gradient descent method that maintains first‑ and second‑order moment estimates of gradients and applies decoupled weight decay for regularization. Supports configurable learning‑rate schedules, beta coefficients, epsilon stability term, and an optional AMSGrad variant.", "business_intent": "Provide a robust, memory‑efficient optimizer for training neural networks that accelerates convergence while preventing overfitting through decoupled weight decay, suitable for large‑scale deep learning workloads.", "keywords": ["AdamW", "optimizer", "adaptive moments", "weight decay", "learning rate schedule", "AMSGrad", "deep learning", "gradient descent", "regularization", "Keras"], "summary_hash": "5838deb135f4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:26:59+00:00"}
