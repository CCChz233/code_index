{"summary": "This module provides a loss class that implements a symmetric multiple‑negative ranking objective for sentence‑pair embeddings. It computes a similarity matrix between two batches of embeddings, applies temperature scaling, and uses cross‑entropy loss in both directions to maximize similarity of matching pairs while minimizing similarity with all other pairs, enabling efficient contrastive training without explicit negative sampling.", "business_intent": "To supply an effective training loss for sentence‑transformer models that leverages many implicit negative examples, improving semantic similarity and retrieval performance while simplifying the training pipeline.", "keywords": ["sentence transformer", "multiple negatives", "symmetric ranking loss", "contrastive learning", "embedding similarity", "cross entropy", "torch", "training objective", "semantic similarity"], "summary_hash": "b235fcd80dc2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:53:33+00:00"}
