{"summary": "This module offers helper utilities for PyTorch distributed environments used in MONAI. It includes a logging filter that emits messages only from a specified process rank, functions that abstract all‑gather operations across processes (handling both native torch and Ignite contexts and supporting tensors that are evenly divisible), and a routine to obtain the appropriate device for distributed communication.", "business_intent": "To streamline the development of distributed medical imaging workflows by providing easy‑to‑use abstractions for inter‑process communication, rank‑aware logging, and device handling, thereby reducing boilerplate and compatibility issues with Ignite and native PyTorch distributed APIs.", "keywords": ["distributed training", "PyTorch", "all-gather", "rank filter", "logging", "device selection", "Ignite integration", "MONAI utilities"], "summary_hash": "ac3f6c1cea55", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:05:56+00:00"}
