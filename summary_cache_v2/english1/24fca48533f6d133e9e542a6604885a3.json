{"summary": "Implements a reference-level method for constructing exact quantum circuits that realize the exponential of a given operator by forming its full matrix, performing precise matrix exponentiation, and synthesizing the resulting unitary. Intended for small problem sizes where a brute‑force approach is feasible.", "business_intent": "Provides a benchmark and verification tool for quantum software developers and researchers to compare approximate synthesis techniques against a mathematically exact baseline.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit synthesis", "matrix exponentiation", "exact operator evolution", "benchmark", "reference implementation", "small systems", "unitary synthesis"], "summary_hash": "b4dc3e320b10", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:59:57+00:00"}
