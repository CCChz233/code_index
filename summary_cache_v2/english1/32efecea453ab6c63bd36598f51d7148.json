{"summary": "This module implements a decorator that allows Metaflow pipeline steps to declare required secrets. It defines a specification object for each secret, handling its identifier, role, backend type, and options, and provides serialization utilities. The decorator integrates with the step execution lifecycle to fetch the declared secrets from the configured backend, inject them as environment variables, and perform validation to ensure no disallowed or conflicting variables are set.", "business_intent": "Facilitate secure and configurable access to confidential data within workflow steps, enabling users to specify and retrieve secrets automatically while preventing accidental exposure or misconfiguration of environment variables.", "keywords": ["secrets", "decorator", "environment variables", "Metaflow", "pipeline step", "backend", "role", "validation", "configuration", "secure data handling"], "summary_hash": "a61aa5fa7b54", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:11:28+00:00"}
