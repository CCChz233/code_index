{"summary": "The module provides a collection of Matplotlib‑based style classes and utilities for rendering vertical cross‑section plots of atmospheric variables (e.g., clouds, wind, temperature, humidity, potential vorticity, trajectory probabilities). Each class prepares the required data fields, applies a consistent visual theme, and integrates with the MSS web‑map‑service framework to produce ready‑to‑display figures.", "business_intent": "To support scientific web‑map services by delivering standardized, high‑quality vertical section visualizations of meteorological data, enabling researchers and operational users to explore atmospheric profiles through web interfaces.", "keywords": ["matplotlib", "vertical section", "atmospheric visualization", "style classes", "cloud cover", "wind speed", "temperature", "humidity", "potential vorticity", "trajectory probability", "web map service", "MSS", "scientific plotting"], "summary_hash": "36325a0dcef5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:47:48+00:00"}
