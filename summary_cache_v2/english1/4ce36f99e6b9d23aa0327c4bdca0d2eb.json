{"summary": "This module defines unit tests that verify the correct functionality of a random Gaussian sharpening transform used in medical image preprocessing. It includes parameterized test cases across various array types, checks deterministic behavior with fixed seeds, and validates output consistency and shape.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the reliability and correctness of random Gaussian sharpening augmentation in medical imaging pipelines, ensuring that downstream models receive consistent and properly transformed data.", "keywords": ["RandGaussianSharpen", "unit test", "MONAI", "Gaussian sharpening", "image augmentation", "parameterized testing", "numpy arrays", "medical imaging", "deterministic behavior", "preprocessing validation"], "summary_hash": "cd6557f47b01", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:48:19+00:00"}
