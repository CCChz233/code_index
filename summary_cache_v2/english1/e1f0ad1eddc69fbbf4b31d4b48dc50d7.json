{"summary": "The module contains unit tests that verify the behavior of the Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) callback within the PyTorch Lightning framework. It defines lightweight models and a custom callback to exercise SWA under various training configurations, including single‑GPU, multi‑GPU (DDP, spawn), custom learning‑rate schedulers, checkpoint resumption, and error handling scenarios.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the SWA feature in the Lightning library functions correctly and robustly across different training strategies, scheduler setups, and checkpointing workflows, providing confidence in its reliability for production and research use.", "keywords": ["stochastic weight averaging", "PyTorch Lightning", "callback testing", "multi‑GPU", "distributed data parallel", "learning rate scheduler", "checkpoint resume", "misconfiguration handling", "optimizer", "model training"], "summary_hash": "626da84a6d85", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:36:28+00:00"}
