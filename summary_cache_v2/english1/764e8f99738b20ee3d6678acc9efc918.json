{"summary": "A command‑line script that orchestrates supervised fine‑tuning of vision‑language models (e.g., LLaVA, Llama‑3.2 Vision‑Instruct) using the TRL library, Accelerate, and DeepSpeed. It loads a HuggingFace dataset, prepares the model and processor, configures training (batch size, gradient accumulation, mixed precision, quantization/PEFT options), and launches distributed training on multiple GPUs.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to quickly adapt state‑of‑the‑art multimodal models to their own instruction‑following datasets, accelerating the creation of customized visual assistants and reducing the engineering effort required for large‑scale VLM fine‑tuning.", "keywords": ["vision-language model", "supervised fine-tuning", "LLaVA", "Llama-3.2 Vision-Instruct", "TRL", "Accelerate", "DeepSpeed", "distributed training", "HuggingFace dataset", "quantization", "PEFT", "bfloat16", "multi‑GPU"], "summary_hash": "db542d8229b4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:01:57+00:00"}
