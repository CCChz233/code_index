{"summary": "Implements a BART-specific tokenizer that uses byte‑level Byte‑Pair‑Encoding and treats leading spaces as part of tokens, mirroring the original BART pre‑training tokenization. It loads vocabulary and merge files, handles special tokens (bos, eos, sep, cls, unk, pad, mask), and provides methods for converting between text, token strings, and token IDs while supporting optional prefix‑space handling and split‑into‑words mode.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless preparation of textual data for BART models in applications such as summarization, translation, and sequence classification by providing accurate token‑to‑id and id‑to‑token mappings with correct handling of special tokens and space‑sensitive tokenization.", "keywords": ["BART", "tokenizer", "byte-level BPE", "space handling", "special tokens", "vocabulary", "NLP", "pre‑trained model", "text preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "069256ab3008", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:57:44+00:00"}
