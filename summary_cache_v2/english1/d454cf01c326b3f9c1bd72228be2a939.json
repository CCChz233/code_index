Allows custom execution device selection and can coordinate with a preceding module’s offload hook in a pipeline.", "business_intent": "Reduce GPU memory consumption by offloading model computation to the CPU, enabling larger or multi‑stage models to run on limited hardware and improving resource utilization in inference or training pipelines.", "keywords": ["cpu offload", "model device management", "memory optimization", "execution device selection", "pipeline coordination", "torch device handling"], "summary_hash": "0873abad746a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:08:08+00:00"}
