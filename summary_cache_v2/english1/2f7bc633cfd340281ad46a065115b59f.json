{"summary": "The module defines preprocessing transforms used in the automatic 3D segmentation application, chiefly a transform that checks that segmentation label volumes share the same spatial dimensions as their corresponding source images and, when the size difference is within a configurable tolerance, automatically resamples the labels to the source size using nearest‑neighbor interpolation.", "business_intent": "To guarantee spatial consistency between images and labels during data preparation for medical image segmentation models, reducing errors and simplifying the training pipeline.", "keywords": ["medical imaging", "3D segmentation", "preprocessing", "shape validation", "label resampling", "nearest neighbor interpolation", "tolerance", "MONAI", "auto3dseg", "transform"], "summary_hash": "47c23b84d261", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:24:52+00:00"}
