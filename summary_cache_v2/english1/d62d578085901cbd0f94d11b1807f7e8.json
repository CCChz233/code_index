{"summary": "The module implements algorithms that solve the token‑swapping problem on arbitrary connectivity graphs and provides utilities for building quantum circuits that realize arbitrary qubit permutations with SWAP gates. It offers an approximation engine that generates near‑optimal SWAP sequences for routing qubits, together with helper functions to construct and manipulate the resulting circuits.", "business_intent": "To improve the efficiency of quantum circuit transpilation by automatically finding short SWAP schedules that map logical qubits onto physical hardware, thereby reducing circuit depth, error rates, and execution time on quantum processors.", "keywords": ["token swapping", "approximation algorithm", "SWAP gate", "qubit routing", "quantum circuit", "transpiler", "permutation", "graph", "heuristic", "optimization"], "summary_hash": "07c01be25391", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:09:16+00:00"}
