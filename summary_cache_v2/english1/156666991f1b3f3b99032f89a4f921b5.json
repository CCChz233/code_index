{"summary": "This module orchestrates the generation of language model responses for a function‑calling benchmark. It loads test specifications, configures model handlers (including credential setup), runs single‑ and multi‑turn inference—optionally in parallel with retry logic—and writes the generated outputs to result files for later evaluation.", "business_intent": "Provide an automated pipeline to evaluate and rank language models on function‑calling tasks by generating their responses against a curated test suite.", "keywords": ["LLM", "function calling", "benchmark", "inference", "multi‑turn", "model handler", "concurrency", "retry", "result generation", "evaluation"], "summary_hash": "b6dd31bec122", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:40:44+00:00"}
