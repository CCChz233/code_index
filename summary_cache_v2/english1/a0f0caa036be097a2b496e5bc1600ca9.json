{"summary": "The module implements a high‑performance regridding utility that transforms collections of raster‑like layers onto a target grid. It builds a compiled routine on first use based on a selected aggregation method and reuses it for subsequent calls, minimizing JIT overhead.", "business_intent": "Provide fast, reusable preprocessing for spatial datasets so that model inputs or analysis layers can be aligned to a common grid, improving workflow efficiency in geoscientific or environmental modeling pipelines.", "keywords": ["regrid", "raster", "layer transformation", "grid alignment", "numba", "JIT compilation", "aggregation methods", "xarray", "high performance", "spatial preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "47dd1ecec1bd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:45:35+00:00"}
