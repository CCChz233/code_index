{"summary": "The package provides a comprehensive framework for representing, accessing, and post‑processing the data returned by quantum circuit executions. It defines schema‑compliant models for experiment outcomes, a central Result object that aggregates backend metadata and experiment results, and utilities to convert raw execution data into user‑friendly forms such as measurement counts, memory snapshots, statevectors, unitaries, and sampled expectation values. Additional helpers support data manipulation, marginal extraction, and error handling.", "business_intent": "To give quantum‑computing users a reliable, high‑level interface for retrieving and analyzing the outcomes of quantum jobs, enabling tasks like counting measurement results, reconstructing quantum states, evaluating operator expectations, and integrating results with downstream applications.", "keywords": ["quantum computing", "result processing", "measurement counts", "statevector", "unitary", "expectation value", "post‑processing", "data model", "serialization", "utility functions"], "summary_hash": "fc9830f3ecdc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:02:28+00:00"}
