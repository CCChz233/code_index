{"summary": "The Router class acts as a central orchestrator for interacting with multiple AI model deployments. It abstracts various model capabilities (e.g., text completion, embedding, image generation, transcription) behind a unified interface, handling routing decisions, health checks, cooldown logic, fallback strategies, retries, and usage tracking.", "business_intent": "To provide a resilient and configurable routing layer that dynamically selects the optimal model deployment for a request, ensures high availability through fallbacks and retries, enforces policy constraints, and simplifies client interaction with diverse AI services.", "keywords": ["routing", "model deployment", "fallback", "retry", "async", "completion", "embedding", "image generation", "health check", "load balancing", "policy enforcement", "metrics", "cooldown", "AI services"], "summary_hash": "a223a1928da8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:39:23+00:00"}
