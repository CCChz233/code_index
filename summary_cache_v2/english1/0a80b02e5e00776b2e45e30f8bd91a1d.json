{"summary": "This module defines a suite of unit tests and supporting grid fixtures that validate the SurfaceForcing component of the ROMS tools package. The tests cover initialization with global and regional datasets, handling of grids that cross the International Date Line, detection and filling of NaN values, verification of file integrity via hash comparison, YAML serialization round‑trips, and basic save/plot operations.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that surface forcing data used in ocean model simulations is correctly processed, stored, and visualized, especially under edge‑case conditions such as dateline crossing and missing values, thereby increasing confidence in model inputs and downstream scientific analyses.", "keywords": ["surface forcing", "ROMS", "unit testing", "grid handling", "date line crossing", "nan detection", "hash verification", "yaml serialization", "data saving", "plotting", "regional data", "global data"], "summary_hash": "11624a6fb94f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:16:24+00:00"}
