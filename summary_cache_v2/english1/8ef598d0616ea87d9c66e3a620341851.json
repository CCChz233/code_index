{"summary": "The module defines two dataset classes for left‑to‑right language model training. One class builds an indexed, token‑based dataset from raw text, handling tokenization, fixed‑length sequence generation, stride control, and optional caching. The other class reads pre‑tokenized data stored in tarred NumPy files via a JSON manifest, creates the same fixed‑length sequences, and supports distributed loading with shard partitioning, scatter/replicate strategies, and optional look‑ahead shuffling.", "business_intent": "Provide scalable, efficient data pipelines for training and evaluating left‑to‑right language models on large text corpora, including support for distributed environments and compressed tarred data formats.", "keywords": ["language modeling", "dataset", "tokenization", "left-to-right", "sequence generation", "stride", "caching", "tarred files", "webdataset", "distributed training", "shard partitioning", "scatter", "replicate", "shuffling", "numpy", "pytorch"], "summary_hash": "56b34ca93031", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:27:48+00:00"}
