{"summary": "Implements a Qiskit transpiler pass that routes a quantum circuit onto a device's coupling map by inserting SWAP operations. It evaluates multiple candidate qubit layouts using a bounded beam search, scoring each potential SWAP based on how well it enables upcoming two‑qubit gates, and selects the layout that maximizes immediate gate applicability while keeping added SWAPs low.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum algorithms to run on real hardware by automatically adapting circuit qubit placement to the physical connectivity constraints, reducing the overhead of SWAP gates and improving overall execution fidelity.", "keywords": ["quantum transpilation", "routing", "SWAP insertion", "beam search", "coupling map", "layout optimization", "Qiskit", "hardware constraints", "circuit mapping"], "summary_hash": "1e42edba75ae", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:27:38+00:00"}
