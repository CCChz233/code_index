{"summary": "The module defines a Lightning callback that automatically applies stochastic weight averaging (SWA) during model training. It controls when averaging starts, updates the averaged parameters each epoch, synchronizes batch‑norm statistics, and offers utilities to save, load, and transfer the SWA model state.", "business_intent": "Enable users to improve model generalization and stability by seamlessly integrating SWA into their PyTorch Lightning training pipelines without manual bookkeeping.", "keywords": ["stochastic weight averaging", "SWA", "PyTorch Lightning", "callback", "model averaging", "batch normalization", "optimizer", "learning rate scheduler", "checkpointing", "training stability"], "summary_hash": "e9128e4a1b99", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:55:53+00:00"}
