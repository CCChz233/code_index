{"summary": "This module implements a client that exploits the Zerologon vulnerability to impersonate a domain controller, acquire a Netlogon session key, and relay DCSync requests to the DRSUAPI service for extracting Active Directory credentials. It also includes support for the underlying RPC communication and patched remote operation helpers for SAMR interactions.", "business_intent": "Enable penetration testers or red‑team operators to perform credential dumping from Active Directory by leveraging NTLM relay and Zerologon attacks, thereby assessing the security of domain environments.", "keywords": ["NTLM relay", "Zerologon", "DCSync", "Active Directory", "credential dumping", "RPC", "DRSUAPI", "Netlogon", "domain controller impersonation", "password hashes", "Impacket"], "summary_hash": "e48ce9f06fdb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:18:44+00:00"}
