{"summary": "This module defines placeholder functions intended to perform inverse distance weighted interpolation between source and target grids for UXarray data structures (DataArray and Dataset). The current implementations contain no operational code and are not integrated elsewhere in the package.", "business_intent": "To enable geoscientific applications to transfer and interpolate spatial data across different grid representations using an inverse distance weighting scheme, thereby supporting model coupling and data analysis workflows.", "keywords": ["inverse distance weighting", "remapping", "interpolation", "UXarray", "DataArray", "Dataset", "grid conversion", "geospatial", "placeholder", "stub"], "summary_hash": "39f2bdce7b41", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:28:17+00:00"}
