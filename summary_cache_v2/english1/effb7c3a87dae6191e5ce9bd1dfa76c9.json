{"summary": "This module offers a collection of reusable pulse programming macros that generate standard pulse schedules for common quantum hardware operations, such as performing measurements and handling memory slot mappings, abstracting low‑level pulse instructions into higher‑level convenience functions.", "business_intent": "Enable Qiskit Pulse users to quickly build and reuse typical pulse sequences—especially measurement routines—without manually assembling low‑level instructions, thereby improving developer productivity and ensuring consistent hardware control across experiments.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "pulse", "macros", "quantum", "measurement", "schedule", "hardware control", "backend", "instruction mapping", "memory slot"], "summary_hash": "dbe68627f35a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:50:58+00:00"}
