{"summary": "The module implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using TensorFlow and DGL's message‑passing framework. It defines a GCN layer that aggregates neighbor features, builds a multi‑layer GCN model, loads citation graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed), and provides training, evaluation, and inference logic for node classification tasks.", "business_intent": "Showcase how to construct and train a GCN with message passing on standard citation network benchmarks, serving as a reference implementation for TensorFlow practitioners interested in graph neural networks.", "keywords": ["TensorFlow", "DGL", "Graph Convolutional Network", "GCN", "message passing", "citation networks", "Cora", "Citeseer", "Pubmed", "node classification", "graph neural network", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "edeee0fbfd16", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:11:37+00:00"}
