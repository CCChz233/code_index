{"summary": "Defines the 2‑D transformer backbone used in the Stable Diffusion 3 pipeline. The module converts latent image tensors into patch embeddings, runs them through a configurable stack of joint self‑ and cross‑attention transformer blocks, and returns the transformed latent features. It integrates optional PEFT/LoRA adapters, layer‑norm, and embedding utilities to support flexible model configuration and loading from original checkpoints.", "business_intent": "Supply the core neural‑network component that powers image generation in Stable Diffusion 3, enabling efficient processing of latent representations with attention mechanisms for downstream diffusion inference.", "keywords": ["transformer", "2D", "stable diffusion 3", "latent representation", "patch embedding", "self‑attention", "cross‑attention", "PEFT", "LoRA", "PyTorch", "model architecture", "diffusion model"], "summary_hash": "70b9d4a941f8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:31:05+00:00"}
