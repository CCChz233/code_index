{"summary": "The class encapsulates an N‑qubit element of the CNOT‑Dihedral group, representing it internally as an invertible binary affine transformation together with a degree‑≤3 phase polynomial over Z₈. It supports construction from compatible quantum circuits, algebraic operations such as composition, tensoring and adjoint, and conversion back to circuit, gate, matrix or Operator objects for simulation and analysis.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient manipulation, synthesis and benchmarking of quantum circuits that consist solely of CNOT, T, X and related Clifford gates by providing a compact mathematical model and seamless translation between circuit, matrix and operator forms.", "keywords": ["quantum", "CNOT-Dihedral", "affine function", "phase polynomial", "circuit synthesis", "operator conversion", "composition", "tensor product", "adjoint", "simulation"], "summary_hash": "6e94deeb6014", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:24:55+00:00"}
