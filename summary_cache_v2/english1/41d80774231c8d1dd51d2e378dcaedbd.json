{"summary": "This package provides comprehensive data handling utilities for text‑to‑speech (TTS) and vocoder model training. It defines dataset classes that read manifests, load and optionally resample audio, extract acoustic features (mel‑spectrograms, pitch, energy), compute alignment priors, tokenize transcripts for various TTS architectures, manage speaker identifiers, filter and normalize samples, and collate them into padded batches. It also includes a length‑aware bucket sampler for efficient distributed training and support for streaming audio from tarred archives.", "business_intent": "Facilitate scalable and efficient preparation of speech synthesis training data, enabling rapid development and deployment of high‑quality TTS and vocoder models in production environments.", "keywords": ["text-to-speech", "TTS dataset", "vocoder dataset", "audio loading", "mel-spectrogram", "pitch extraction", "energy extraction", "alignment prior", "tokenization", "speaker metadata", "collate function", "bucket sampler", "distributed training", "manifest", "tarred archives", "resampling", "duration filtering", "volume normalization"], "summary_hash": "ba4e10c06346", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:01:47+00:00"}
