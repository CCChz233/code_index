{"summary": "The module is a training script that demonstrates how to use a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) model with PyTorch and DGL to perform node classification on the ACM academic citation network. It downloads the dataset, builds a heterogeneous graph, initializes the model, runs the training loop, and evaluates performance.", "business_intent": "Provide a reference implementation for applying graph neural networks to heterogeneous academic networks, enabling organizations to analyze citation graphs, recommend related research, or predict paper categories using deep learning.", "keywords": ["Heterogeneous Graph Transformer", "HGT", "PyTorch", "DGL", "node classification", "ACM dataset", "graph neural network", "training script", "parameter counting"], "summary_hash": "e4513291ba8f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:23:45+00:00"}
