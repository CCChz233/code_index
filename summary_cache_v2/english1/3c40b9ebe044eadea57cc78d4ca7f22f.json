{"summary": "Provides a command‑line application that reads one or more simtel_array output files, extracts the simulated event histograms, and computes the trigger rate (overall and energy‑dependent) for the full array or individual telescopes. It can optionally save the resulting rate tables and estimate the effective collection area either from the simulation configuration or from the spatial distribution of events.", "business_intent": "Enables CTA simulation teams to quantify detector performance by calculating realistic trigger rates from Monte‑Carlo data, supporting design validation, sensitivity studies, and operational planning.", "keywords": ["trigger rate", "simtel_array", "CTA", "Monte Carlo", "telescope array", "energy spectrum", "effective area", "data analysis", "command line tool", "performance evaluation"], "summary_hash": "2208b7c34620", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:50:52+00:00"}
