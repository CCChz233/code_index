{"summary": "The module offers a collection of utilities for extracting sub‑domains from climate datasets. It handles coordinate reference system checks, creates spatial masks from bounding boxes or vector shapes, selects grid points, and limits data to specific time intervals, returning the resulting xarray objects.", "business_intent": "Allow analysts and modelers to isolate the geographic region and time period of interest from large climate model outputs, reducing data size and focusing computations on relevant areas.", "keywords": ["climate data", "spatial subsetting", "temporal subsetting", "bounding box", "geographic shape", "CRS compatibility", "xarray", "mask generation", "grid point selection", "time range filtering"], "summary_hash": "4378cfdcd226", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:30:41+00:00"}
