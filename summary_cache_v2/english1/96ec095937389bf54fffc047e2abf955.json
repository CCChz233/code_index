{"summary": "This test suite validates the diarrhoea simulation module by running a dummy component that triggers diarrhoea in all individuals and checking model behavior under various configurations such as different incidence rates, mortality risks, treatment effectiveness, consumable availability, and vaccination impact. It includes helper utilities for running simulations, extracting logs, and assessing outcomes like death counts and treatment effects.", "business_intent": "To verify that the diarrhoea health model accurately reflects epidemiological dynamics and treatment interventions, supporting reliable policy analysis and decision‑making for disease control and resource allocation.", "keywords": ["diarrhoea", "simulation", "testing", "incidence", "mortality", "treatment", "vaccine", "health system", "HSI", "model validation", "epidemiology"], "summary_hash": "1dbbe0503ef1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:43:59+00:00"}
