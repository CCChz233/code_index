{"summary": "Provides a dataset class that reads 3‑dimensional MRI volumes organized in BIDS format and prepares them for deep‑learning workflows. It handles subject file discovery, target mask loading, slice orientation, caching, preprocessing, training‑time augmentations, optional region‑of‑interest cropping, multi‑contrast channel assembly, FiLM metadata selection, object‑detection configuration, and simulation of missing modalities.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to efficiently load, preprocess, and augment BIDS‑compliant 3D neuroimaging data for training and evaluating deep‑learning models, reducing boilerplate code and ensuring consistent handling of complex imaging scenarios.", "keywords": ["BIDS", "MRI", "3D", "dataset loader", "deep learning", "preprocessing", "data augmentation", "ROI cropping", "multichannel contrast", "FiLM metadata", "object detection", "missing modalities", "neuroimaging"], "summary_hash": "bb45960617bb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:30:41+00:00"}
