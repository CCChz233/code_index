{"summary": "Implements a Lightning callback that visualizes training, validation, testing and prediction progress using the Rich library. It defines custom progress‑bar columns for batch counts, processing speed, elapsed time, and metrics, and adds support for datasets without a known size by providing infinite‑task handling. A theme object allows styling of the bar components.", "business_intent": "Provide users of PyTorch Lightning with an informative, customizable, and aesthetically pleasing progress display that works for both finite and infinite data loaders, enhancing monitoring and debugging of model training workflows.", "keywords": ["pytorch lightning", "callback", "rich progress bar", "training progress", "metrics display", "processing speed", "elapsed time", "infinite dataset", "custom columns", "theme styling"], "summary_hash": "7aa45ec949c2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:01:28+00:00"}
