{"summary": "Defines a high‑performance container for groups of N‑qubit Pauli operators, supporting creation from labels, Pauli objects, or symplectic arrays. The container behaves like a NumPy‑style list with indexing, slicing, and iteration, and offers bulk algebraic utilities such as composition, commutation checks, tensor products, inversion, and conversion to matrix or string label forms. Specialized iterators enable efficient traversal of label and matrix representations.", "business_intent": "Enable fast and convenient manipulation of large Pauli operator sets for quantum‑information tasks such as error‑correction code construction, Hamiltonian simulation, and state‑vector or density‑matrix evolution.", "keywords": ["Pauli", "quantum", "operator list", "symplectic representation", "indexing", "slicing", "iteration", "label conversion", "matrix conversion", "composition", "commutation", "anticommutation", "tensor product", "inverse", "grouping", "graph", "phase", "sorting", "uniqueness", "insertion", "deletion"], "summary_hash": "5bf00b8f943a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:08:37+00:00"}
