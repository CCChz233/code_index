{"summary": "Defines a transformer‑based encoder‑decoder automatic speech recognition model that uses byte‑pair‑encoding (BPE) tokenization and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. The class encapsulates data loading, model construction, training, validation, testing, exporting, and transcription of audio streams, leveraging NeMo’s transformer modules, beam‑search decoding, and mixed‑precision utilities.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and enterprises to build, train, and deploy high‑accuracy speech‑to‑text systems with subword tokenization, facilitating scalable transcription services and integration into voice‑enabled applications.", "keywords": ["speech recognition", "transformer", "encoder-decoder", "CTC loss", "BPE tokenization", "ASR", "NeMo", "PyTorch", "audio transcription", "beam search", "model export", "training pipeline"], "summary_hash": "e181fe73e7dd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:11:33+00:00"}
