{"summary": "The module implements metrics for assessing punctuation prediction quality in speech‑to‑text outputs. It provides classes that compare reference and hypothesis texts, tally correct, missing, extra, and altered punctuation symbols, calculate per‑symbol and overall operation rates, and report a total punctuation error rate. A lightweight helper computes the same metric for individual text pairs.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to quantitatively evaluate and improve punctuation handling in automatic speech recognition and natural language processing systems.", "keywords": ["punctuation evaluation", "error rate metric", "ASR", "reference vs hypothesis", "insertion deletion substitution", "dataset level metric", "occurrence level metric", "regex processing", "progress tracking", "logging"], "summary_hash": "b2f6a71f27f0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:53:05+00:00"}
