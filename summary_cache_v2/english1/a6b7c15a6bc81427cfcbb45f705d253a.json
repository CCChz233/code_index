{"summary": "The module contains unit tests that validate the behavior of bit objects used in quantum circuit construction, checking equality semantics, copying and deep‑copy operations, type safety, and the functionality of newer bit implementations that do not depend on registers.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of bit handling within the quantum circuit library so that developers can reliably build and manipulate circuits without errors related to bit identity or copying.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "bit", "unit test", "equality", "copy", "deep copy", "type safety", "new‑style bit", "register independence", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "63b6cc251628", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:43:48+00:00"}
