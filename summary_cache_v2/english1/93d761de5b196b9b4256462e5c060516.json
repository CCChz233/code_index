{"summary": "Implements an auto‑regressive greedy decoder for RNN‑Transducer models that support multiple blank symbols. It selects the highest‑probability token at each acoustic frame, optionally caps the number of symbols added per step, and can retain detailed alignment histories and per‑frame confidence scores using configurable methods such as max probability or entropy‑based measures.", "business_intent": "Deliver a high‑speed inference engine for speech‑to‑text applications that use multi‑blank RNN‑T, providing transcriptions together with optional alignment and confidence data for downstream analytics or user feedback.", "keywords": ["greedy decoding", "RNN‑Transducer", "multi‑blank", "speech recognition", "auto‑regressive inference", "alignment tracking", "confidence scoring", "entropy", "max probability", "low latency"], "summary_hash": "6be582485752", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:31:17+00:00"}
