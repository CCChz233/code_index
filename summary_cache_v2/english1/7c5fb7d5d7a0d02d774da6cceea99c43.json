{"summary": "Provides a transpiler analysis pass that inspects PauliEvolutionGate instances, groups Pauli operators that mutually commute, optionally decomposes them into two‑qubit components, and encodes the resulting commuting relationships as graph edges for downstream routing passes.", "business_intent": "Enable more efficient quantum circuit compilation by detecting commuting Pauli terms, allowing the transpiler to schedule two‑qubit operations together, thereby reducing circuit depth and error rates during hardware execution.", "keywords": ["quantum transpiler", "commuting Pauli", "PauliEvolutionGate", "analysis pass", "graph edges", "two-qubit routing", "circuit optimization", "Qiskit", "DAGCircuit", "SparsePauliOp"], "summary_hash": "c247d561002a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:30:58+00:00"}
