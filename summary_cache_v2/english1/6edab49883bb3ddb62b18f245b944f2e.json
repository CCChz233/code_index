{"summary": "This module implements a comprehensive suite of reduction operations for Dask arrays, providing chunk‑wise aggregation, combination, and cumulative logic. It defines generic reduction utilities and specific helpers for statistical measures (sum, product, mean, variance, standard deviation, min, max, argmin, argmax) as well as NaN‑aware variants, top‑k selection, and prefix‑scan algorithms, all integrated with Dask's blockwise and high‑level graph execution model.", "business_intent": "To enable efficient, scalable, and lazy computation of array-wide aggregates and statistics on large, possibly out‑of‑core datasets by leveraging Dask's parallel execution framework.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "reduction", "parallel", "aggregation", "chunk", "cumulative", "statistics", "nan-aware", "topk", "prefix scan", "high-level graph"], "summary_hash": "cd0ef9b10444", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:17:37+00:00"}
