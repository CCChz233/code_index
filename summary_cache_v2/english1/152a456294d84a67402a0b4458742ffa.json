{"summary": "The module defines a set of benchmark suites that measure the speed of tensor indexing operations, such as index selection and scaled index addition, including both reference (baseline) and optimized implementations. It supplies helper routines for forward and backward passes and integrates with the generic benchmark driver to run experiments across data types and configurations.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to quantitatively assess and compare the efficiency of different indexing kernels in the library, supporting performance tuning and hardware‑specific optimization decisions.", "keywords": ["benchmarking", "index selection", "scaled index addition", "performance measurement", "PyTorch", "xformers", "tensor ops", "baseline comparison", "forward pass", "backward pass"], "summary_hash": "e645a42da68d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:28:13+00:00"}
