{"summary": "The package implements a multiscale speaker diarization decoder built on NeMo's EncDecDiarLabelModel. It loads configurations, manages experiments, sets random seeds, logs progress, and performs hierarchical segmentation to generate speaker turn predictions from audio inputs. An accompanying command‑line script demonstrates how to run inference with the trained model on audio files.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and analysts to automatically segment audio recordings by speaker using a neural diarization model, supporting applications such as meeting transcription, call analytics, and multimedia indexing.", "keywords": ["speaker diarization", "multiscale decoding", "hierarchical segmentation", "NeMo", "EncDecDiarLabelModel", "audio processing", "command line interface", "inference", "configuration management", "logging"], "summary_hash": "d08f05df9170", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:55:59+00:00"}
