{"summary": "The module provides high‑level utilities for handling media streams in real‑time communication contexts. It includes components to consume and discard incoming tracks, read audio/video from files, network streams or capture devices, record streams to files or image sequences, and relay live tracks to multiple consumers. The implementation leverages asynchronous processing, FFmpeg integration, and custom stream track classes to manage lifecycle, decoding, and packet forwarding.", "business_intent": "To simplify the integration of audio and video sources and sinks in WebRTC applications, allowing developers to play back, record, discard, or broadcast media streams with minimal boilerplate and robust asynchronous handling.", "keywords": ["media player", "media recorder", "media sink", "media relay", "stream track", "WebRTC", "asynchronous", "FFmpeg", "audio", "video", "real‑time streaming"], "summary_hash": "11e581f2806c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:47:04+00:00"}
