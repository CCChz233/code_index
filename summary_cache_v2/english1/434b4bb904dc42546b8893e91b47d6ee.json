{"summary": "This module offers utilities for creating negative edge samples in graph structures, supporting tasks such as link prediction in graph neural networks. It includes a helper to compute redundancy among sampled edges and a stub for a global uniform negative sampling strategy.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient generation of negative examples required for training and evaluating graph neural network models, particularly for contrastive or link prediction objectives.", "keywords": ["negative sampling", "graph neural networks", "link prediction", "edge sampling", "redundancy calculation", "graph learning", "DGL", "machine learning"], "summary_hash": "5aac869777fd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:37:42+00:00"}
