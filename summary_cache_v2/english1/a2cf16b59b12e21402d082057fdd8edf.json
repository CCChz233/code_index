{"summary": "The example suite demonstrates how to train and use textual inversion embeddings that personalize Stable Diffusion models. It includes scripts for PyTorch, Flax/JAX, and SDXL back‑ends, handling dataset preparation, argument parsing, training loops, checkpointing, model‑card generation and optional upload to the HuggingFace hub, as well as tests that verify the end‑to‑end workflow.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with a ready‑to‑run reference for creating custom token embeddings that capture new concepts (e.g., objects, styles) in text‑to‑image diffusion models, enabling commercial or research applications that require personalized image generation without retraining the full model.", "keywords": ["textual inversion", "stable diffusion", "custom token embedding", "fine‑tuning", "diffusion model", "PyTorch", "Flax", "JAX", "SDXL", "accelerate", "checkpoint", "model card", "HuggingFace hub", "training loop", "inference"], "summary_hash": "bc6b537e99f5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:36:50+00:00"}
