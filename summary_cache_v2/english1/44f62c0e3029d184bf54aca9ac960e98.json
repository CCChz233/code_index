{"summary": "Provides a domain‑specific language for constructing quantum pulse schedules using an imperative, context‑managed API. It creates and manipulates schedules, handles channel mapping, timing alignment, and integrates with backends, while exposing helper functions for common pulse operations, macros, and utility conversions.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to write, compose, and execute low‑level quantum control programs more easily, facilitating precise hardware control, hybrid circuit‑pulse workflows, and rapid prototyping of experiments on quantum devices.", "keywords": ["quantum pulse", "schedule builder", "imperative API", "context manager", "channel mapping", "timing alignment", "backend integration", "measurement", "macro", "utility functions"], "summary_hash": "edce029ffdfe", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:51:03+00:00"}
