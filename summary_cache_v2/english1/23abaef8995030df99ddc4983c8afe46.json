{"summary": "Defines a configurable deep neural network that progressively reduces high‑dimensional tensors using convolutional or residual blocks with stride‑based downsampling, and maps the compressed representation to low‑dimensional outputs via a fully‑connected layer for regression, multi‑label classification, or discriminator/critic purposes.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and developers in medical imaging and related fields with a ready‑to‑use, adaptable architecture for building models that predict continuous values, multiple labels, or serve as adversarial critics, accelerating model development and experimentation.", "keywords": ["deep learning", "regression network", "convolutional blocks", "residual units", "downsampling", "fully connected layer", "multi‑label classification", "discriminator", "critic", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "configurable architecture"], "summary_hash": "65945f9093a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:17:31+00:00"}
