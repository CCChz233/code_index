{"summary": "Implements a diffusion‑based pipeline that converts a single RGB image (optionally guided by text) into dense per‑pixel surface‑normal vectors using the Marigold methodology. The pipeline coordinates a conditional UNet, a variational auto‑encoder, a diffusion scheduler, and a CLIP text encoder to encode inputs, run denoising diffusion, decode latents into normal maps, optionally aggregate multiple samples, and normalize the resulting vectors for output.", "business_intent": "Enables developers and researchers to generate high‑quality surface‑normal maps from ordinary images, supporting downstream tasks such as 3D reconstruction, augmented/virtual reality content creation, graphics rendering, and computer‑vision analysis.", "keywords": ["diffusion pipeline", "surface normal map", "Marigold", "conditional UNet", "variational auto‑encoder", "diffusion scheduler", "CLIP encoder", "image-to-normal conversion", "3D reconstruction", "AR/VR"], "summary_hash": "662c7966bcfb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:42:55+00:00"}
