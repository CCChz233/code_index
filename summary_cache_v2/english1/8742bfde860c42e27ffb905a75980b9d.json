{"summary": "The module defines a collection of classes that model the structure of a pulse‑level quantum object (Qobj) used in Qiskit. These classes represent pulse libraries, experiment configurations, individual instructions, and measurement options, and provide methods for comparison, string representation, and conversion to and from dictionary forms for serialization.", "business_intent": "To provide a standardized, serializable representation of pulse‑based quantum experiments so that they can be constructed, validated, transmitted to quantum hardware, and interpreted by the Qiskit runtime and backends.", "keywords": ["pulse", "qobj", "quantum", "experiment", "configuration", "instruction", "measurement", "serialization", "dictionary", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "0b6d260a9a09", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:55:48+00:00"}
