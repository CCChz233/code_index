{"summary": "Implements a Viterbi decoder that operates on weighted finite‑state automaton (WFSA) graphs using the k2 backend. It supports decoding with a pure topology graph or a topology composed with a token language‑model graph, configurable output as either the single best path or a full lattice, and options for label handling and frame‑aligned output. Batch splitting can be used to limit memory usage.", "business_intent": "Provides a flexible, graph‑based decoding component for sequence‑modeling applications such as speech recognition, enabling integration of language‑model constraints and efficient extraction of decoded sequences or lattices for downstream processing.", "keywords": ["Viterbi decoding", "WFSA", "k2 backend", "token language model", "topology graph", "1-best path", "lattice output", "batch splitting", "speech recognition", "sequence decoding"], "summary_hash": "94c8da5680dc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:13:17+00:00"}
