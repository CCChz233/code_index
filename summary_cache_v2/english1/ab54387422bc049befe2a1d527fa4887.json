{"summary": "Provides a class that detects peaks in a one‑dimensional time series within user‑defined amplitude bounds, extracts aligned windows around each event, and computes the conditional average waveform, its variance, peak locations, arrival times, and waiting‑time statistics, while ensuring unit consistency and offering options such as minimum peak separation and removal of non‑maximal peaks.", "business_intent": "Enables scientists and engineers to statistically characterize recurring features in plasma or other physical time‑series data, supporting quantitative analysis of event shapes, timing, and variability for research, diagnostics, and model validation.", "keywords": ["conditional averaging", "time series", "peak detection", "event alignment", "variance", "inter‑event interval", "signal processing", "astropy units", "numpy", "scipy"], "summary_hash": "f2d7f2dd73e9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:11:54+00:00"}
