{"summary": "The module provides the core infrastructure for interacting with language models in the Berkeley Function Call Leaderboard. It defines an abstract handler that oversees prompt creation, step limiting, execution of generated function calls, response serialization, and integration with multi‑turn evaluation utilities. Accompanying utilities handle prompt transformation, extraction and formatting of function calls, AST parsing, and value conversion needed for model communication.", "business_intent": "Enable standardized evaluation and benchmarking of language models on function‑calling capabilities by offering a reusable handler and supporting utilities for consistent prompt management, function execution, and result processing.", "keywords": ["language model", "function calling", "prompt processing", "AST parsing", "response serialization", "multi‑turn evaluation", "benchmarking", "leaderboard", "handler", "utilities"], "summary_hash": "7c1e0c0f321d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:46:37+00:00"}
