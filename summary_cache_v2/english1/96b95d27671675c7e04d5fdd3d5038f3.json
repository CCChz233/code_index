{"summary": "Adds self‑loop edges to every node of a DGL graph and returns a new graph. Handles homogeneous graphs directly and heterogeneous graphs only for edge types where source and destination node types are identical, with an option to create a separate self‑loop edge type per node type. Supports removal of existing self‑loops to prevent duplicates and initializes self‑loop edge features either with a constant value or by aggregating incoming edge features using mean, sum, max, or min.", "business_intent": "Enhance graph data for graph neural network models by ensuring each node has a self‑connection and providing appropriate edge feature values, thereby improving message‑passing effectiveness and model performance.", "keywords": ["self-loop", "graph transformation", "heterogeneous graph", "edge feature initialization", "aggregation", "duplicate removal", "new edge type", "DGL", "graph preprocessing", "GNN"], "summary_hash": "29e9e4dec991", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:35:33+00:00"}
