{"summary": "The RayTracing class conducts optical ray‑tracing simulations for a given telescope model, creates point‑spread‑function images, extracts photon data, and computes statistical metrics such as mean and standard deviation. It also provides utilities to read, store, and export simulation results and to visualise images and histograms.", "business_intent": "To evaluate and optimise the optical performance of telescope designs by automating ray‑tracing runs, analysing the resulting point‑spread‑functions, and delivering actionable metrics and visual reports for engineering and scientific decision‑making.", "keywords": ["ray tracing", "telescope simulation", "optical performance", "point spread function", "image analysis", "statistical metrics", "visualisation", "simulation configuration", "data export"], "summary_hash": "56d3ae8d1ad7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:44:45+00:00"}
