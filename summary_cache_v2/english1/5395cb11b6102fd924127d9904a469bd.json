{"summary": "The module contains example scripts that illustrate how to fine‑tune a Megatron‑based Stable Diffusion model with the DreamBooth technique and how to run inference with the resulting personalized text‑to‑image model, including a LoRA‑based variant. It shows trainer configuration, optional regularisation data handling, model loading, and image generation from prompts.", "business_intent": "To guide developers in building customized AI image generation solutions by demonstrating end‑to‑end DreamBooth training and inference workflows with NVIDIA NeMo, thereby accelerating adoption of personalized diffusion models in products and services.", "keywords": ["DreamBooth", "text-to-image", "diffusion model", "Stable Diffusion", "NVIDIA NeMo", "Megatron", "fine-tuning", "personalization", "LoRA", "inference", "PyTorch Lightning"], "summary_hash": "2651ed6addef", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:56:51+00:00"}
