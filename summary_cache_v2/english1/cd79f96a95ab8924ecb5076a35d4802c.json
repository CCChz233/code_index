{"summary": "The module implements a relational graph convolutional network pipeline for link prediction on heterogeneous knowledge‑graph data. It provides utilities for sampling negatives, iterating subgraphs, encoding nodes with RGCN layers, scoring edges with a link‑prediction head, computing loss (including regularization), and evaluating ranking metrics such as mean reciprocal rank. The implementation is built on DGL and PyTorch and targets benchmark datasets like FB15k‑237.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and engineers to train and evaluate relational GCN models for knowledge‑graph link prediction, offering a ready‑to‑use reference that handles data preparation, model definition, negative sampling, training loops, and performance measurement.", "keywords": ["relational graph convolutional network", "RGCN", "link prediction", "knowledge graph", "FB15k-237", "negative sampling", "DGL", "PyTorch", "node embeddings", "MRR evaluation"], "summary_hash": "4f6fd7ee581b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:18:49+00:00"}
