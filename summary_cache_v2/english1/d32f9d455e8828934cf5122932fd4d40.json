{"summary": "The module implements a transpiler transformation that reorients asymmetric two‑qubit gates in a quantum circuit so that their logical control‑target order aligns with the directed coupling map of the target backend, using known gate identities to flip directions and providing a utility to swap node arguments.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum circuit compilation to respect hardware connectivity directionality, ensuring generated circuits are compatible with physical devices and can be executed efficiently.", "keywords": ["quantum computing", "transpiler", "gate orientation", "coupling map", "two-qubit gates", "circuit transformation", "Qiskit", "hardware constraints", "gate rewriting"], "summary_hash": "498b4930935c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:26:07+00:00"}
