{"summary": "A configuration container that defines all architectural hyperparameters for the ALIGN text encoder, such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of transformer layers, attention heads, activation functions, dropout rates, position embedding type, and initialization settings. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate or customize an ALIGN text model.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to easily set up, customize, and reproduce the ALIGN text encoder architecture for training or inference, ensuring compatibility with pretrained weights and simplifying model configuration management.", "keywords": ["ALIGN", "text encoder", "configuration", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "dropout", "position embeddings", "pretrained model", "model initialization"], "summary_hash": "7dc5b34005f6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:48:45+00:00"}
