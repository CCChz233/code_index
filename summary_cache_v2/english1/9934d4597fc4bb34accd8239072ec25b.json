{"summary": "The module defines a class that stores and manages annual, day‑of‑year indexed vegetation parameters (soil cover, leaf area index, interception capacity, evaporation and ponding factors) for each vegetation type and can write these data to the fact_svat.inp file required by the hydrological model when the WOFOST crop model is not employed.", "business_intent": "Provide the necessary vegetation‑related input data for the MSW hydrological model, allowing simulations to run without coupling to the WOFOST crop model and ensuring accurate representation of crop‑related water balance processes.", "keywords": ["vegetation", "crop factors", "time series", "soil cover", "leaf area index", "interception", "evaporation", "ponding", "hydrological modeling", "input file generation", "MSW", "WOFOST", "xarray", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "892bce53ea91", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:43:53+00:00"}
