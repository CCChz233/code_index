{"summary": "This module implements a Prefect worker that runs flow runs in separate operating‑system processes. It defines a configuration class for building the command line, a worker class that starts, monitors, and terminates the subprocess, and a result class that captures the final status and output of the execution. Helper utilities parse and retrieve the infrastructure process identifier and optionally use a threaded watcher for child processes.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable, isolated execution environment for Prefect flow runs by launching them as subprocesses, allowing users to poll work pools, manage process lifecycles, and collect execution results in a structured way.", "keywords": ["process worker", "subprocess execution", "flow run", "Prefect", "work pool", "job configuration", "process lifecycle", "result handling", "infrastructure PID", "child watcher", "asynchronous monitoring"], "summary_hash": "dd1eaae7c2e7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:30:13+00:00"}
