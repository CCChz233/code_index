{"summary": "This package implements the logging connector for the PyTorch Lightning trainer. It ties trainer lifecycle hooks to one or more logging backends, handling metric collection, tensor‑to‑scalar conversion, distributed aggregation, progress‑bar updates and logger initialization. It also includes utilities to validate the FX‑based logger configuration and to compose synchronous result operations used by the connector.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless, reliable logging of training metrics and progress across diverse environments (including distributed and SLURM setups) while ensuring correct configuration of advanced FX logging components.", "keywords": ["logging", "PyTorch Lightning", "trainer", "metrics aggregation", "distributed training", "progress bar", "TensorBoard", "CSV logger", "FX validator", "result orchestration", "connector", "lifecycle events", "SLURM compatibility"], "summary_hash": "3d652d7adff1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:14:16+00:00"}
