{"summary": "The module serves as the core public API for interacting with large language models and related AI services. It defines high‑level classes that encapsulate completion, chat, and asynchronous workflows, and provides functions for text completion, embeddings, image generation, moderation, speech, and transcription. The code integrates provider‑specific backends, handles routing, configuration, caching, logging, token counting, and retry logic, offering a unified, lightweight interface for developers to call AI models across many vendors.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to easily access and manage a wide range of AI model capabilities (text generation, chat, embeddings, image creation, etc.) through a single, consistent SDK, abstracting provider differences, handling operational concerns like retries and logging, and simplifying integration of LLM services into applications.", "keywords": ["LLM", "text completion", "chat", "embeddings", "image generation", "moderation", "speech", "transcription", "async", "streaming", "provider routing", "token management", "caching", "logging", "API wrapper"], "summary_hash": "6ddda00e35ca", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:14:37+00:00"}
