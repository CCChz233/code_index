{"summary": "Implements a 2‑dimensional fully convolutional network with three input channels, using a compact decoder built from graph convolution (GCN) and refinement modules. The model allows configurable output channels and upsampling strategies (transposed convolution or bilinear interpolation) and can optionally load ImageNet‑pretrained weights.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑use deep‑learning model for pixel‑wise prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation, enabling quick integration and optional pretrained initialization for faster convergence.", "keywords": ["FCN", "2D", "fully convolutional network", "decoder", "GCN", "refine module", "upsampling", "transpose convolution", "bilinear interpolation", "pretrained", "ImageNet", "segmentation", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "78733a8c6667", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:50:17+00:00"}
