{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that accepts an image, a mask, and a textual prompt to generate inpainted results. It encodes images with a VAE, processes prompts with a CLIP text encoder, denoises latents using a UNet conditioned on the prompt, and steps through a scheduler. The pipeline can adapt masks automatically, load textual inversion and LoRA weights, run safety checks, and optionally offload models to CPU.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and creative professionals with an automated tool to edit or fill specific regions of images based on natural language instructions, facilitating fast content creation, photo retouching, and visual effects workflows.", "keywords": ["image inpainting", "stable diffusion", "text-guided generation", "adaptive mask", "diffusion pipeline", "latent diffusion", "CLIP", "UNet", "safety checker", "LoRA", "textual inversion"], "summary_hash": "89525eef5114", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:33:32+00:00"}
