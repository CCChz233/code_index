{"summary": "The module provides a command‑line driven script that fine‑tunes a Llama‑2 causal language model using Deep Preference Optimization (DPO) on paired StackExchange question‑answer data. It parses configuration arguments, loads the dataset, prepares the tokenizer and model with LoRA adapters, configures the DPO trainer, and executes the training process.", "business_intent": "To enable researchers and developers to improve the quality of Llama‑2 generated answers by training the model with human preference data from StackExchange, facilitating more accurate and helpful conversational AI.", "keywords": ["Llama-2", "Deep Preference Optimization", "DPO", "StackExchange", "fine-tuning", "LoRA", "accelerate", "TRL", "preference data", "language model training"], "summary_hash": "7e321e2c0a10", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:02:32+00:00"}
