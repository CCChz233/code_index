{"summary": "A collection of DGL‑based neural network layers that implement the DiffPool hierarchical pooling scheme. It includes generic and specific neighbor‑aggregation modules (mean, max‑pool, LSTM), a utility for bundling node inputs during per‑node computation, and core GNN components that compute assignment matrices, aggregate features, and generate multi‑level graph embeddings for batched graphs.", "business_intent": "Provide reusable building blocks for constructing differentiable pooling graph neural networks, enabling developers and researchers to build hierarchical graph representations for tasks such as graph classification, regression, or clustering.", "keywords": ["DiffPool", "graph neural network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "aggregation", "mean pooling", "max pooling", "LSTM", "node bundling", "hierarchical pooling", "graph embeddings", "batched graphs", "inductive learning"], "summary_hash": "821045e04c64", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:58:02+00:00"}
