{"summary": "This module implements the core components of a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for text‑to‑image generation. It defines a base diffusion class, a lightweight wrapper, a latent diffusion model that encodes inputs, applies conditioned diffusion, computes training losses, and performs iterative sampling, as well as a Megatron‑based variant that adds large‑scale model parallelism, adapter integration, and checkpoint handling. The code also includes utilities for schedule management, logging, and image conversion, supporting the full training‑validation‑testing lifecycle.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, high‑performance framework for training and generating images from textual prompts using latent diffusion, enabling both standard and distributed (Megatron) deployments for advanced AI art and content creation applications.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "denoising", "latent diffusion", "stable diffusion", "text-to-image", "training pipeline", "sampling", "model parallelism", "Megatron", "autoencoder", "conditioning", "loss computation", "schedule management", "checkpointing", "adapter", "PEFT"], "summary_hash": "1b19163cda79", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:07:23+00:00"}
