{"summary": "The class orchestrates the creation of a synthetic room‑impulse‑response (RIR) corpus. It validates a configuration describing room dimensions, acoustic properties, and microphone array geometry, then samples room parameters, source locations, and array placements to generate impulse responses at a specified sampling rate.", "business_intent": "Provide a tool for building large, configurable acoustic datasets used in speech enhancement, source localization, and audio simulation applications.", "keywords": ["RIR", "room acoustics", "microphone array", "synthetic dataset", "impulse response generation", "configuration validation", "sampling rate", "source positioning", "audio simulation"], "summary_hash": "1a595e2cb678", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:14:06+00:00"}
