{"summary": "The module offers a complete export pipeline that converts QNemo model checkpoints into optimized TensorRT‑LLM inference engines. It normalizes and aligns configuration dictionaries, prepares the build environment, loads appropriate tokenizers (SentencePiece or HuggingFace), and orchestrates the TensorRT‑LLM build process to produce a ready‑to‑run engine.", "business_intent": "Enable rapid deployment of NeMo large language models in production by providing a streamlined conversion to high‑performance TensorRT‑LLM engines, reducing latency and resource usage for inference workloads.", "keywords": ["NeMo", "TensorRT-LLM", "model conversion", "checkpoint export", "configuration alignment", "tokenizer support", "SentencePiece", "HuggingFace", "inference optimization", "large language models"], "summary_hash": "874f0faac4f0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:12:02+00:00"}
