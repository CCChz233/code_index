{"summary": "The module provides a unittest suite that checks the ONNX export process of a MONAI bundle model. It prepares configuration, runs the export command, and asserts that a valid ONNX file is produced, handling temporary directories and platform-specific skips.", "business_intent": "To ensure that trained medical imaging models can be reliably converted to the ONNX format for cross‑platform deployment, facilitating integration into production pipelines and downstream inference services.", "keywords": ["ONNX", "model export", "MONAI", "bundle", "unit test", "PyTorch", "configuration parser", "temporary files", "skip conditions", "Windows compatibility", "command line testing"], "summary_hash": "d822cf734313", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:31:53+00:00"}
