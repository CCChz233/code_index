{"summary": "The module runs multiple ALRI simulation scenarios, extracts incidence, mortality and case‑fatality data from log outputs, and builds comparative visualisations to assess the impact of treatment strategies such as standard therapy or pulse‑oximetry‑guided care. It aggregates results into tables for model calibration and analysis.", "business_intent": "Enable health analysts and policymakers to evaluate and calibrate the effectiveness of ALRI interventions, supporting evidence‑based decisions on treatment deployment and resource allocation.", "keywords": ["ALRI", "simulation", "treatment comparison", "pulse oximetry", "mortality", "incidence", "calibration plots", "health outcomes", "scenario analysis", "model calibration"], "summary_hash": "0161356f3e43", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:04:58+00:00"}
