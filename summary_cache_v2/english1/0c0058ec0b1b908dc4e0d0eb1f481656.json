{"summary": "The module implements evaluation utilities for a PyTorch metric‑learning model. It defines distance and gradient measurement tools, runs performance assessments on one or multiple datasets (including query‑gallery setups), records results to CSV files, and optionally visualises metrics with matplotlib.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and engineers with a ready‑to‑use framework for measuring and analysing the retrieval quality of deep embedding models, enabling model validation, comparison, and debugging in applications such as image search or person re‑identification.", "keywords": ["evaluation", "distance metric", "gradient analysis", "PyTorch", "metric learning", "retrieval performance", "CSV reporting", "visualisation", "smooth AP"], "summary_hash": "09b44c7d1624", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:27:24+00:00"}
