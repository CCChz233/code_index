{"summary": "This module defines a unit‑test suite that verifies the behavior of the random Gaussian smoothing transform used in medical imaging preprocessing. It generates synthetic data, applies the transform under various configurations, and checks that the output matches expected statistical and numerical properties.", "business_intent": "Provide automated validation to guarantee that the random Gaussian smoothing operation works correctly across different data formats and parameter settings, thereby supporting reliable image augmentation in the MONAI framework.", "keywords": ["testing", "RandGaussianSmooth", "Gaussian smoothing", "random augmentation", "MONAI", "unit tests", "parameterized", "numpy", "medical imaging", "image preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "93fa80034456", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:33:21+00:00"}
