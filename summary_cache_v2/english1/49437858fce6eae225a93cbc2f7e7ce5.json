{"summary": "This module offers helper utilities for handling random number generator seeds across Python's random module, NumPy, and PyTorch. It can capture and restore RNG states, create deterministic seed sequences, initialize data‑loader workers with consistent seeds, and reset or set global seeds, while respecting distributed rank‑zero semantics and providing logging support.", "business_intent": "Enable reproducible and deterministic training runs in Lightning Fabric, especially in distributed or multi‑process environments, by centralizing seed management and ensuring consistent random behavior across libraries.", "keywords": ["seed management", "random reproducibility", "Python random", "NumPy", "PyTorch", "distributed training", "worker initialization", "rank zero", "logging"], "summary_hash": "4a8796045825", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:03:11+00:00"}
