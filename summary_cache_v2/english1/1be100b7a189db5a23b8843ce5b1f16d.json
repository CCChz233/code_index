{"summary": "CPOTrainer orchestrates the fine‑tuning of a pretrained transformer model using Conditional Preference Optimization. It prepares data, concatenates inputs, computes specialized CPO and cross‑entropy losses, runs training and evaluation loops, generates model outputs, logs metrics, and supports optional PEFT adapters, callbacks, and custom optimizers.", "business_intent": "Enable AI product teams to efficiently align language models with human preferences by providing a ready‑to‑use training pipeline that improves model behavior for downstream applications.", "keywords": ["model fine‑tuning", "preference optimization", "transformers", "loss calculation", "evaluation loop", "data tokenization", "text generation", "metric logging", "PEFT integration", "callback management"], "summary_hash": "c91431714004", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:52:24+00:00"}
