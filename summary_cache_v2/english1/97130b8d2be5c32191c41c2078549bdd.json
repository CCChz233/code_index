Fast high-order solver for diffusion ODEs. Provides configuration of sigma schedule, solver order, prediction type, thresholding, algorithm type, etc. Handles noise schedule, step updates, multistep solver updates (first, second, third order). Provides methods to compute sigmas, convert model outputs, precondition inputs/outputs, scale model input, add noise, set timesteps, step through diffusion process.\n\nBusiness intent: Provide efficient sampling for diffusion-based generative models (e.g., image generation) using DPMSolver++ algorithm, enabling faster inference with high-quality results, configurable for guided or unconditional generation.\n\nKeywords: diffusion, scheduler, DPMSolver, EDM, high-order solver, sigma schedule, noise, sampling, generative models, inference acceleration, thresholding, algorithm type, solver order.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed to ensure no method names verbatim.
