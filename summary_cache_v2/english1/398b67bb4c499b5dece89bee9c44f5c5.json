{"summary": "This module implements a base class for diffusion‑based generative models used in text‑to‑image generation (e.g., Stable Diffusion). It encapsulates core functionality such as applying the diffusion network, preparing conditioning inputs, tracking sample usage across model checkpoints, and initializing training procedures.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, extensible component that enables developers to integrate, train, and manage diffusion models for high‑quality text‑to‑image synthesis within AI products and services, while ensuring proper resource accounting and checkpoint handling.", "keywords": ["diffusion model", "text-to-image", "stable diffusion", "generative AI", "conditioning", "sample accounting", "checkpoint management", "training initialization", "PyTorch", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "0f383bb2a563", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:06:29+00:00"}
