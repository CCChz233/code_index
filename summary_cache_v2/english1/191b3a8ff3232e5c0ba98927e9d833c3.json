{"summary": "The package provides scenario classes that automate the execution of a health‑system simulation model under a range of human‑resource capability expansion assumptions. It generates combinations of model parameters, samples inputs, configures logging, runs the model (locally or via a batch system), and records configuration metadata and outcomes for comparative analysis against a baseline scenario.", "business_intent": "To quantify the health impact of expanding health‑system human‑resource capabilities, enabling policymakers and planners to assess trade‑offs and prioritize investments in workforce development.", "keywords": ["health system simulation", "human resource capability expansion", "scenario analysis", "parameter sampling", "baseline comparison", "outcome quantification", "policy impact assessment", "batch execution", "model orchestration", "logging"], "summary_hash": "cce9f88aaac2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:05:24+00:00"}
