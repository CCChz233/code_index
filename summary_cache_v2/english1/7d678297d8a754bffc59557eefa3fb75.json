{"summary": "The module contains unit tests that verify the correct implementation of sea‑ice area and sea‑ice extent indicators. It checks unit handling, behavior when inputs are dimensionless, basic calculation scenarios, and that the indicators return expected values.", "business_intent": "Validate the reliability of sea‑ice climate indicators to support accurate climate monitoring and research applications.", "keywords": ["sea ice", "area", "extent", "unit handling", "dimensionless", "indicator", "test", "xclim", "climate indices", "validation"], "summary_hash": "aa9cb7603ecd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:31:05+00:00"}
