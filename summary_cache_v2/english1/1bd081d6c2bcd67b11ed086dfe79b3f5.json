{"summary": "This module supplies benchmark knowledge‑graph datasets for the Deep Graph Library. It defines dataset classes that download, cache, and parse standard KG benchmarks (e.g., FB15k, FB15k‑237, WN18), build DGL graph objects with optional reverse edges, and expose node and relation statistics together with train/validation/test edge masks for link‑prediction experiments.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to quickly obtain and use widely‑used knowledge‑graph benchmarks for training and evaluating graph neural network models on link‑prediction tasks.", "keywords": ["knowledge graph", "benchmark dataset", "DGL", "graph neural network", "link prediction", "FB15k", "FB15k-237", "WN18", "graph construction", "reverse edges", "edge masks", "graph learning"], "summary_hash": "99bc36a5ef69", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:40:54+00:00"}
