{"summary": "Defines the foundational Callback class for PyTorch Lightning, providing a structured interface for users to attach custom logic to key stages of the training, validation, testing, and prediction pipelines. The class offers hook methods that are invoked at events such as the start and end of training, epochs, batches, and optimizer steps, enabling seamless integration of additional behavior without modifying core training code.", "business_intent": "Facilitate extensible and maintainable machine‑learning workflows by allowing developers to plug in reusable components (e.g., logging, checkpointing, early stopping, metric computation) that react to lifecycle events of a Lightning model, thereby accelerating development and improving code modularity.", "keywords": ["callback", "base class", "PyTorch Lightning", "training loop hooks", "event-driven", "extensibility", "custom logic", "optimizer handling", "logging", "model checkpoint", "early stopping", "modular training"], "summary_hash": "271e66f49183", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:55:10+00:00"}
