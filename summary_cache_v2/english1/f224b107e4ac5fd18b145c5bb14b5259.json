{"summary": "The module supplies a helper class that encapsulates common operations related to artificially matched layers (AML) within the MAPDL pre‑processor. It offers straightforward methods to query AML configuration settings and compute the geometric size parameters needed to define the layers in a simulation model.", "business_intent": "Enable users to quickly and correctly configure artificially matched layers in ANSYS MAPDL simulations, reducing setup complexity and improving the accuracy and performance of electromagnetic analyses.", "keywords": ["artificially matched layers", "AML", "MAPDL", "preprocessor", "configuration", "size parameters", "utility", "simulation setup", "electromagnetic", "boundary condition"], "summary_hash": "99609c6c8791", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:04:42+00:00"}
