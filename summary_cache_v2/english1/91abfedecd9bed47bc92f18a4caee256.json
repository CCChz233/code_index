{"summary": "A module that resizes input tensors (typically images) to a target spatial size, supporting explicit height‑width specifications or scaling based on a chosen side (short, long, vertical, horizontal). It offers multiple interpolation algorithms, optional corner alignment, and antialiasing for down‑sampling to preserve visual quality.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and high‑quality image resizing within deep‑learning preprocessing workflows, ensuring consistent tensor dimensions for downstream models.", "keywords": ["resize", "tensor", "image scaling", "interpolation", "antialiasing", "computer vision", "preprocessing", "PyTorch", "Kornia"], "summary_hash": "0f49ffc50a11", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:04:45+00:00"}
