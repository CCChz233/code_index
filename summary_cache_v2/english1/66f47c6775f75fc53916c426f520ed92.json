{"summary": "The core package of Albumentations defines the foundational infrastructure for building and managing image augmentation pipelines. It includes abstract transformation interfaces, configuration handling, random parameter generation, and serialization mechanisms. Additional utilities cover validation of transformation definitions, conversion and processing of annotation formats such as bounding boxes and keypoints, Pydantic‑compatible parameter validators, and a mixin for publishing components to a model hub.", "business_intent": "To provide developers of computer‑vision applications with a reliable, extensible framework for creating, configuring, validating, and sharing image augmentation workflows, ensuring consistent handling of image data and associated annotations across training and inference pipelines.", "keywords": ["image augmentation", "computer vision", "transformation pipeline", "serialization", "validation", "bounding boxes", "keypoints", "configuration", "hub integration", "pydantic", "utilities"], "summary_hash": "7af10e032cd8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:29:57+00:00"}
