{"summary": "Provides a command‑line tool that prepares a text‑image dataset, integrates Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, and runs a distributed fine‑tuning loop using Accelerate. It manages tokenization, preprocessing, training hyper‑parameters, checkpointing, optional logging (e.g., Weights & Biases), and generates a model card for publishing the adapted model.", "business_intent": "Allow researchers and developers to efficiently fine‑tune large Stable Diffusion models on custom captioned image datasets with minimal compute and storage overhead, enabling rapid creation and sharing of lightweight, task‑specific diffusion models.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion", "LoRA", "text-to-image fine‑tuning", "low‑rank adaptation", "distributed training", "Accelerate", "dataset preprocessing", "checkpointing", "model publishing", "Hugging Face Hub"], "summary_hash": "a634eb9d349c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:38:59+00:00"}
