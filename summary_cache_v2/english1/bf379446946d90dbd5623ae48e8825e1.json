{"summary": "Provides end‑to‑end processing for clustering speaker embeddings extracted from extended audio recordings. It validates inputs, segments embeddings into manageable windows, runs inference to assign speaker labels, aggregates results across windows, and converts raw clustering outputs into usable label structures.", "business_intent": "Facilitates speaker diarization in long‑form recordings for use cases such as meeting transcription, call center analytics, and media content indexing.", "keywords": ["speaker clustering", "diarization", "long-form audio", "embedding windowing", "inference", "label unpacking", "speech analytics"], "summary_hash": "0f00a2f96196", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:24:24+00:00"}
