{"summary": "The module defines utilities for managing cyclic data in a graph generation workflow. It includes a dataset wrapper that supplies samples with standard indexing and batching, an evaluation component that runs a model through successive cycles, formats metrics, performs rollouts, and produces summary reports, and a printing helper that tracks and updates cycle progress. Additional helper functions for graph conversion and sequence handling are present, though some appear unused.", "business_intent": "Enable systematic training, validation, and reporting of graph generation models by providing structured cycle datasets, automated evaluation across multiple generation steps, and clear progress logging.", "keywords": ["graph generation", "cycle dataset", "model evaluation", "PyTorch", "metrics", "rollout", "printing", "data pipeline", "DG-MG"], "summary_hash": "da12c604494d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:24:25+00:00"}
