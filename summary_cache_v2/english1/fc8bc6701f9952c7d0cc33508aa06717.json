{"summary": "Implements a readout error mitigation strategy that treats each qubit independently, using a separate 2×2 assignment/mitigation matrix per qubit. It can be calibrated from experimental data or derived from backend properties, and provides corrected expectation values and quasi‑probability distributions with computational cost scaling as O(2^N).", "business_intent": "Enable fast and accurate correction of measurement errors in quantum hardware when errors are assumed uncorrelated, improving the reliability of downstream analytics such as expectation‑value calculations and probability estimations.", "keywords": ["readout error mitigation", "tensor product", "independent qubits", "quantum measurement correction", "expectation value", "quasi‑probabilities", "calibration", "backend properties", "mitigation matrix", "O(2^N) efficiency"], "summary_hash": "1e3cc703188d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:17:03+00:00"}
