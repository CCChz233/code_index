{"summary": "Implements a retrieval component for Retrieval‑Augmented Generation that can operate in a distributed environment using Ray. It maintains model configuration, question and generator tokenizers, an optional index, and a pool of Ray actor workers that each load the index in separate processes. During training or inference it forwards queries to the remote actors, aggregates their results, and falls back to a local index when Ray is not used.", "business_intent": "Provide scalable, high‑throughput document retrieval for RAG models, allowing large‑scale training and inference across multiple machines or cores while abstracting away the complexity of inter‑process communication.", "keywords": ["distributed retrieval", "Ray", "RAG", "index lookup", "tokenizers", "remote actors", "parallel processing", "scalability", "retrieval workers", "transformers"], "summary_hash": "799a416e4bfc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:09:32+00:00"}
