{"summary": "A comprehensive test suite for the various diffusion scheduler implementations used in the library. The tests cover initialization, configuration parsing, beta and timestep schedule generation, noise handling, prediction and variance types, step computation, clipping, thresholding, device and precision compatibility, and full inference loops across many scheduler variants (e.g., DDIM, DDPM, DPMSolver, Euler, Heun, LMS, PNDM, UniPC, etc.).", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness, stability, and reproducibility of diffusion scheduler components so that downstream generative models can be trained and deployed reliably, reducing bugs and improving user confidence in the library.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "testing", "DDIM", "DDPM", "DPMSolver", "Euler", "Heun", "LMS", "PNDM", "UniPC", "noise", "beta schedule", "timestep", "prediction type", "variance", "device compatibility", "precision", "inference loop", "model checkpoint"], "summary_hash": "4a51c57eacb5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:32:12+00:00"}
