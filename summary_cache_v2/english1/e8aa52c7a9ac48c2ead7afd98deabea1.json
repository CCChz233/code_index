{"summary": "Encapsulates a wav2vec2‑based neural network that produces fixed‑dimensional speaker embeddings (x‑vectors) from raw audio. It manages convolutional and TDNN output size calculations, runs the forward pass, and provides methods to freeze the base wav2vec2 encoder or feature extractor for selective fine‑tuning.", "business_intent": "Enable robust speaker verification/identification and related speech analytics by supplying a ready‑to‑use embedding extractor that can be trained or fine‑tuned efficiently.", "keywords": ["wav2vec2", "x‑vector", "speaker embedding", "audio processing", "TDNN", "model freezing", "feature extractor", "deep learning", "speech representation", "speaker verification"], "summary_hash": "c65a00d459a3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:25:15+00:00"}
