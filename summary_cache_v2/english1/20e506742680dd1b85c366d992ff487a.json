{"summary": "Represents a collection of pseudo‑random generator keys as an array‑like pytree, abstracting the underlying uint32 key representation. It behaves like an array for indexing, iteration, reshaping and sharding, but deliberately hides arithmetic operations, exposing only PRNG‑specific actions such as splitting keys, generating random bits, and folding in values.", "business_intent": "Provide a safe, high‑level abstraction for managing groups of PRNG keys in JAX‑style environments, enabling deterministic and parallel‑compatible random number generation across distributed computations.", "keywords": ["PRNG", "key array", "random number generation", "JAX", "array‑like container", "deterministic randomness", "key splitting", "fold‑in", "sharding", "pytree"], "summary_hash": "f23f41ca52c0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:27:11+00:00"}
