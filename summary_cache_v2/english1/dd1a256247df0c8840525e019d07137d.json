{"summary": "A collection of utilities that add observability to Large Language Model (LLM) workflows. It includes a context manager to automatically start and finish tracing sessions, decorators for instrumenting functions with spans, a lightweight logger for LLM events, and an asynchronous task manager that queues and executes tracing-related coroutines. The module handles creation of trace and span identifiers, attribute aggregation, status handling, and asynchronous delivery of tracing data to Agenta’s backend service.", "business_intent": "To give developers built‑in tracing and monitoring capabilities for LLM applications, enabling easier debugging, performance analysis, and compliance reporting by sending structured trace data to Agenta’s observability platform.", "keywords": ["LLM tracing", "observability", "context manager", "decorators", "logging", "async task manager", "trace IDs", "spans", "backend integration", "monitoring"], "summary_hash": "77baeb82c3df", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:28:47+00:00"}
