{"summary": "The module defines a directed‑acyclic‑graph neural network architecture for semi‑supervised node classification on citation graph benchmarks. It includes a graph convolution component that respects DAG structures, a multi‑layer perceptron block, and the overall network composition. Command‑line utilities load standard datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed), set random seeds, train the model with PyTorch and DGL, and evaluate performance.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run reference implementation for researchers and developers to experiment with DAG‑based graph neural networks, reproduce results on common citation datasets, and serve as a baseline for further algorithmic development or educational purposes.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "node classification", "citation networks", "Cora", "Citeseer", "Pubmed", "graph convolution", "MLP", "training loop", "evaluation", "reproducibility"], "summary_hash": "07382dc3eaec", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:53:08+00:00"}
