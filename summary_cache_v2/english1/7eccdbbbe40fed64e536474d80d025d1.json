{"summary": "The module contains a unittest suite that runs parameterized checks on the spacing transformation applied to medical image data. It verifies that the transform correctly adjusts voxel spacing, respects image orientation, yields the expected output shapes, and behaves consistently across eager and lazy execution modes, different devices, and data types.", "business_intent": "To provide comprehensive regression testing for the spacing resampling component of a medical imaging preprocessing library, ensuring reliable and consistent behavior in production pipelines on both CPU and GPU environments.", "keywords": ["spacing", "resampling", "medical imaging", "transform validation", "orientation handling", "shape consistency", "eager execution", "lazy execution", "unit testing", "MONAI", "torch", "numpy", "parameterized tests"], "summary_hash": "b564030d27af", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:35:40+00:00"}
