{"summary": "The module provides a broad collection of independent helper routines that perform numerical and scientific calculations, statistical analyses, geometry operations, and retrieve external information such as weather, location, and financial data via web APIs. Each function is self‑contained and does not depend on other parts of the codebase, serving as example executable code for evaluation purposes.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑made library of diverse, self‑contained functions that can be called programmatically to test and benchmark function‑calling capabilities across domains like mathematics, physics, finance, and external data access.", "keywords": ["utility functions", "mathematical calculations", "physics formulas", "financial calculations", "API data retrieval", "statistical helpers", "geometry", "external services", "standalone helpers"], "summary_hash": "c0d4c2d76dc0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:41:19+00:00"}
