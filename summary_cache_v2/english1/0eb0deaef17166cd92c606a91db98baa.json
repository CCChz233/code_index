{"summary": "Base class that implements common logic for applying rigid and affine transformations to 2D data such as images, masks, bounding boxes and keypoints. It manages transformation matrices, probability of application per element or per batch, optional same transformation across a batch, and shape handling.", "business_intent": "Enable configurable, probabilistic geometric augmentations in computer‑vision training pipelines, providing consistent transformations and inverse operations for multiple annotation types.", "keywords": ["augmentation", "rigid transformation", "affine transformation", "2D", "transformation matrix", "probability", "batch processing", "same_on_batch", "keepdim", "masks", "bounding boxes", "keypoints", "inverse operation", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "592b802e8f0b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:51:44+00:00"}
