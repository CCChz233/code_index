{"summary": "This module implements a graph neural network using DGL and PyTorch. It defines a model class that constructs the network layers, executes message‑passing across the graph, and produces node embeddings or predictions. A supporting module encapsulates the core neighbor‑aggregation logic used during the forward computation.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable GNN implementation that can be integrated into applications needing graph‑structured data processing, such as social network analysis, recommendation engines, or scientific graph modeling.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "GNN", "PyTorch", "DGL", "message passing", "node embeddings", "graph representation learning", "deep learning", "graph analytics"], "summary_hash": "13bfbb974c2b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:13:38+00:00"}
