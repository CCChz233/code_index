{"summary": "The module supplies a lightweight predicate framework and specialized syntax components that allow policy definitions to express and evaluate logical conditions for various resource types such as CVE records, infrastructure‑as‑code configurations, and secret objects. It includes generic wrappers, hashable comparators, and concrete risk‑factor predicates to support composable, comparable, and storable policy checks.", "business_intent": "To empower the policy engine with reusable, composable predicate abstractions that can filter, validate, and assess security and compliance aspects of code, infrastructure, and vulnerability data, enabling automated risk evaluation and enforcement of security standards.", "keywords": ["policy engine", "predicate", "syntax", "CVE", "infrastructure-as-code", "IaC", "secrets", "risk factor", "hashable comparator", "logical conditions", "compliance", "security assessment"], "summary_hash": "23531aabcc17", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:13:45+00:00"}
