{"summary": "This module defines the Stinespring class, which encapsulates the Stinespring dilation (isometry) representation of a quantum channel. It provides functionality to construct, validate, and manipulate channels in this form, and to convert between Stinespring, Kraus, Choi, and superoperator representations within the Qiskit quantum information framework.", "business_intent": "Enable users to work with quantum channels using the Stinespring representation, facilitating theoretical analysis, simulation, and interoperability with other channel representations in quantum computing applications.", "keywords": ["quantum channel", "Stinespring dilation", "isometry", "Kraus representation", "Choi matrix", "superoperator", "Qiskit", "quantum information", "channel conversion", "linear map"], "summary_hash": "acbf6516a47b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:07:03+00:00"}
