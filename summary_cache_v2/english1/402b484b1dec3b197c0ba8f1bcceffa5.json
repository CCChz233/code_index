{"summary": "Utility module for preparing speech data for the NeMo forced aligner. It offers functions to extract utterance identifiers, augment utterance objects with start/end timestamps, retrieve batch-specific start/end indices and variables, handle character tokenization, and generate manifest lines for batches of audio-transcript pairs. The helpers streamline the creation of NeMo-compatible manifests and token case restoration for downstream forced‑alignment processing.", "business_intent": "Enable automated preprocessing of audio and transcription datasets into the format required by the NeMo forced alignment pipeline, facilitating large‑scale speech alignment tasks.", "keywords": ["data preparation", "speech alignment", "NeMo", "manifest generation", "utterance handling", "batch processing", "tokenization", "audio metadata", "forced aligner"], "summary_hash": "a8a858336a6b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:24:59+00:00"}
