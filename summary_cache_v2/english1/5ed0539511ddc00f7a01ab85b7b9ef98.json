{"summary": "The script illustrates how to construct and solve a 2‑D quadrilateral isoparametric finite element using pure Python. It defines lightweight classes for element behavior and isotropic material, supplies utilities for shape‑function evaluation, gradient calculation, interpolation, and global matrix assembly, and validates the outcome against a MAPDL reference solution.", "business_intent": "Provide an educational, hands‑on example that demonstrates the fundamentals of the finite element method in Python and shows how its results compare with a commercial MAPDL analysis, helping engineers and developers learn and prototype FEM workflows.", "keywords": ["finite element method", "isoparametric element", "quadrilateral element", "Python implementation", "material model", "shape functions", "stiffness matrix assembly", "global matrix assembly", "PyMAPDL validation", "educational example", "structural analysis"], "summary_hash": "2fcb879b9cb6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:06:08+00:00"}
