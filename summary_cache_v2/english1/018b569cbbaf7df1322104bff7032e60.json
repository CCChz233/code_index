{"summary": "A command‑line utility that evaluates a NeMo automatic speech recognition model with a CTC decoder by running beam‑search decoding fused with a KenLM n‑gram language model. It automatically detects character or BPE tokenization, loads an evaluation manifest, applies optional grid‑search over beam width, alpha and beta parameters, computes transcription metrics, and can store prediction outputs.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to measure and improve the accuracy of speech‑to‑text systems when integrating external n‑gram language models, facilitating hyper‑parameter tuning and performance reporting for product quality assurance or research validation.", "keywords": ["ASR", "CTC", "beam search", "KenLM", "n-gram language model", "evaluation", "grid search", "hyperparameter tuning", "speech recognition", "metrics"], "summary_hash": "25971ab13bbd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:51:31+00:00"}
