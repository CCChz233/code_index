{"summary": "The CRXGate class models a two‑qubit controlled‑RX operation, applying an X‑axis rotation by a parameter θ to a target qubit only when the control qubit is in the |1⟩ state. It supplies the gate’s matrix, integrates with Qiskit’s circuit API, and supports inversion and definition utilities.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, parameterised controlled rotation component that quantum algorithm developers can embed in circuits to implement conditional logic, entanglement generation, and algorithmic sub‑routines requiring a controlled RX transformation.", "keywords": ["controlled rotation", "RX gate", "quantum circuit", "Qiskit", "two‑qubit gate", "conditional operation", "matrix representation", "quantum computing", "gate definition", "inverse"], "summary_hash": "4ea38b88361c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:33:18+00:00"}
