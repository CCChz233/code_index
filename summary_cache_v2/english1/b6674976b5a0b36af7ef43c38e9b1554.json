{"summary": "The module supplies a collection of helper classes and utilities that generate custom Matplotlib legend artists representing telescope array configurations and pixel geometries (hexagonal, square, on/off states, edge pixels). It encapsulates the necessary geometric data and drawing logic to render these domain‑specific symbols within plot legends.", "business_intent": "Enable scientific and engineering visualizations of astronomical instrument layouts (e.g., HESS, LST, MAGIC, MST, SCT, SST, VERITAS) and pixel patterns by providing ready‑made, accurate legend symbols, thereby improving plot clarity and consistency for analysis and presentation.", "keywords": ["matplotlib", "legend", "custom handler", "telescope array", "pixel geometry", "hexagonal", "square", "on pixel", "off pixel", "edge pixel", "visualization", "astronomy", "instrumentation", "CTA", "HESS", "LST", "MAGIC", "MST", "SCT", "SST", "VERITAS"], "summary_hash": "9eaf129cc159", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:49:39+00:00"}
