{"summary": "Provides a suite of weight initialization utilities that act as drop‑in replacements for PyTorch's standard initializers, but automatically adjust the initialization scale according to μP (mu‑parameterization) rules after the model's base shapes have been defined. This ensures identical behavior for base‑size models while correctly scaling parameters for wider models.", "business_intent": "Enable consistent and scalable weight initialization across model sizes, ensuring stable training and performance when expanding model width using μP principles.", "keywords": ["weight initialization", "μP scaling", "mu‑parameterization", "model width scaling", "PyTorch compatibility", "stable training", "neural network initialization"], "summary_hash": "9a1befd93b7e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:08:48+00:00"}
