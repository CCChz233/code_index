{"summary": "The module implements neural network components tailored for heterogeneous graphs in DGL with PyTorch. It provides a container for multiple embedding tables keyed by node or edge type, a convolution layer that dispatches type‑specific sub‑modules across edge types and aggregates the results per destination node type, and a linear layer that learns separate weight matrices for each type while producing a common output dimension. Supporting utilities supply common reduction and aggregation functions.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the construction of graph neural network models that operate on graphs with multiple node and edge types, allowing type‑wise parameterization and flexible feature aggregation to improve representation learning on heterogeneous data.", "keywords": ["heterogeneous graph", "embedding", "graph convolution", "type-specific linear", "aggregation", "PyTorch", "DGL", "neural network layer", "multi‑type", "feature reduction"], "summary_hash": "ba7ce4cf1608", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:42:48+00:00"}
