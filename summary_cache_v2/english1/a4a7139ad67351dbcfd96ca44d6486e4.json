{"summary": "The module aggregates a comprehensive set of neural‑network components and full architectures designed for medical imaging tasks, offering configurable encoder‑decoder U‑Net variants, attention gating blocks, dense and residual backbones, FiLM‑conditioned models, and auxiliary layers such as convolutional blocks, up‑sampling modules, and feature‑modulation mechanisms. These building blocks enable the construction of segmentation, counting, and classification pipelines that can be readily integrated into the ivadomed framework for research and clinical applications.", "business_intent": "Accelerate the development and deployment of deep‑learning solutions for medical image analysis by providing a ready‑to‑use, extensible library of model architectures and components that streamline the creation of robust segmentation, detection, and classification pipelines within the ivadomed ecosystem.", "keywords": ["medical imaging", "deep learning", "segmentation", "classification", "U-Net", "attention gate", "DenseNet", "ResNet", "FiLM", "feature modulation", "3D convolution", "model library", "neural network architecture", "image analysis"], "summary_hash": "d56d64ed459b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:33:13+00:00"}
