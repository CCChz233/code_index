{"summary": "A component that evaluates perceptual similarity between images by extracting deep features from a TorchVision convolutional network, currently limited to a ResNet‑50 architecture. It can load pretrained weights automatically or from a user‑provided checkpoint, handling optional state‑dict extraction.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use tool for measuring visual similarity or quality of images in applications such as image retrieval, quality assessment, or generative model evaluation, leveraging pretrained deep features to approximate human perception.", "keywords": ["perceptual similarity", "TorchVision", "ResNet‑50", "pretrained weights", "feature extraction", "image quality assessment", "computer vision", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "9f05f0cb6092", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:26:42+00:00"}
