{"summary": "Implements a multi-head attention module that follows AlphaFold's initialization scheme and supports multiple bias vectors. It prepares query, key, and value tensors, performs the scaled dot‑product attention, and assembles the final output.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable attention component for deep learning models, especially those used in protein structure prediction pipelines like AlphaFold, to capture long‑range interactions efficiently.", "keywords": ["multi-head attention", "AlphaFold", "bias vectors", "query key value", "scaled dot-product", "neural network", "protein folding", "transformer"], "summary_hash": "bebafcb7ae08", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:49:00+00:00"}
