{"summary": "A collection of one‑dimensional signal processing transforms for medical data, offering operations such as wavelet analysis, missing‑value handling, synthetic perturbations (noise, sinusoidal, square pulses), random sample dropping, stochastic scaling, temporal shifting, and frequency‑domain filtering. Complementary dictionary wrappers allow these transforms to be applied selectively to fields within data dictionaries, all designed to integrate seamlessly with MONAI's pipeline architecture.", "business_intent": "To provide robust preprocessing and data augmentation capabilities for 1D medical signals (e.g., ECG, EEG) within MONAI workflows, improving model training, handling of incomplete data, and enabling flexible pipeline construction.", "keywords": ["signal processing", "1D medical data", "data augmentation", "wavelet analysis", "noise injection", "synthetic perturbations", "random dropout", "scaling", "temporal shift", "frequency filtering", "dictionary mapping", "MONAI", "pipeline integration"], "summary_hash": "fc516ceec2ab", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:30:37+00:00"}
