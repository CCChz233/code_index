{"summary": "A highly configurable 2‑D UNet architecture for conditional diffusion models. It consumes a noisy sample, a conditioning tensor, and a timestep embedding, then passes them through customizable down‑sampling, middle, and up‑sampling blocks that can include cross‑attention and transformer layers. The design supports diverse time‑ and class‑embedding strategies, attention slicing, gradient checkpointing, and LoRA integration, allowing fine‑grained control over model capacity and performance.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible backbone for image (or other 2‑D data) generation, inpainting, or restoration tasks that require conditioning on external signals such as text, class labels, or encoder states, facilitating both research experimentation and production deployment of diffusion pipelines.", "keywords": ["UNet", "conditional diffusion", "cross‑attention", "time embedding", "class embedding", "gradient checkpointing", "attention slicing", "LoRA", "transformer blocks", "image generation"], "summary_hash": "48005731031c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:28:08+00:00"}
