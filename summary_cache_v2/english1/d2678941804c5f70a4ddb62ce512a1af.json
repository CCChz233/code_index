{"summary": "A utility that transforms absolute bounding‑box coordinates into scaled regression deltas and reverses the process, using configurable weight factors and a clipping threshold to keep exponential operations numerically stable. It operates on both single boxes and batches, supporting the preparation of training targets and the reconstruction of predicted boxes.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the preparation and interpretation of bounding‑box regression data for object‑detection models, ensuring consistent scaling and numerical safety during training and inference.", "keywords": ["bounding box", "encoding", "decoding", "regression targets", "weights", "clipping", "torch", "object detection"], "summary_hash": "844c6e19ae26", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:18:10+00:00"}
