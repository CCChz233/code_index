{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests for the grid utilities in the plasma package. It defines helper routines to construct uniform and non‑uniform Cartesian grids, debug interpolation objects, and a collection of test cases that verify grid creation, attribute handling, indexing, quantity requirements, vector intersection logic, nearest‑neighbor and volume‑averaged interpolation methods, as well as error handling and persistence behavior.", "business_intent": "The tests aim to guarantee the correctness and robustness of grid representations and interpolation algorithms used in plasma physics simulations, ensuring accurate scientific results and reliable handling of units and edge cases.", "keywords": ["testing", "grid", "plasma", "interpolation", "nearest neighbor", "volume averaging", "Cartesian grid", "non‑uniform grid", "unit handling", "pytest", "astropy", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "f74a93e2dab0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:07:29+00:00"}
