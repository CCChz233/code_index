{"summary": "Implements a strategy that coordinates multi‑process, single‑device training across one or more nodes using distributed data parallelism. It configures the launch environment, establishes process groups, places the model on the appropriate device, synchronizes gradients and parameters, manages optimizer steps, handles exceptions, and cleans up resources after training.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use framework for scaling deep‑learning training to multiple GPUs and machines, reducing development effort and increasing training speed and resource efficiency.", "keywords": ["distributed training", "data parallelism", "multi‑process", "single‑device per process", "PyTorch DDP", "process group backend", "synchronization primitives", "model averaging", "optimizer coordination", "environment setup", "resource scaling"], "summary_hash": "6516c24e6bc1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:11:08+00:00"}
