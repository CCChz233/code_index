{"summary": "The package implements a complete workflow for applying a spatio‑temporal graph convolutional network (STGCN) to wave sensor data. It includes utilities for loading raw measurements into tensors, constructing a graph based on sensor locations, defining the STGCN architecture that combines dilated temporal convolutions, graph convolutions and fully‑connected layers, and evaluating predictions with common regression metrics.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate short‑term forecasting of wave‑related sensor readings (e.g., traffic speed, wave height) by leveraging graph‑structured deep learning, thereby supporting operational planning, resource allocation, and real‑time decision making for transportation or environmental monitoring systems.", "keywords": ["spatio‑temporal graph convolutional network", "PyTorch", "sensor graph", "wave data forecasting", "temporal convolution", "graph convolution", "time series prediction", "evaluation metrics", "data loading"], "summary_hash": "0598fafa6157", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:54:49+00:00"}
