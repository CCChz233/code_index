{"summary": "The module implements a comprehensive suite for analyzing Langmuir probe I‑V characteristics. It defines a data structure for probe characteristics and provides utilities to isolate ion and electron regions, fit linear and inverse relationships, extrapolate saturation currents, and compute key plasma parameters such as electron temperature, densities, plasma and floating potentials, and the electron energy distribution function. High‑level analysis functions support both orbital‑motion‑limited and Laframboise models and include a routine for swept‑probe analysis.", "business_intent": "To give plasma researchers and engineers a ready‑to‑use toolkit for converting raw Langmuir probe measurements into quantitative plasma diagnostics, facilitating experimental interpretation, device tuning, and scientific reporting.", "keywords": ["Langmuir probe", "plasma diagnostics", "electron temperature", "electron density", "ion density", "plasma potential", "floating potential", "EEDF", "I‑V characteristic", "curve fitting", "OML theory", "swept probe analysis"], "summary_hash": "fa438e2e241a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:05:41+00:00"}
