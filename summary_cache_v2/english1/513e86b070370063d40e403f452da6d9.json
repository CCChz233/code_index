{"summary": "Implements a Keras layer that computes the average of each feature across the temporal axis of a 3‑D tensor, optionally retaining the reduced dimension and handling both channel‑first and channel‑last formats.", "business_intent": "Provides a simple way to collapse sequence data into a fixed‑size representation, enabling downstream dense layers to work with variable‑length inputs while supporting masking and configurable output shape.", "keywords": ["global average pooling", "temporal reduction", "1D sequence", "channels_last", "channels_first", "keepdims", "masking", "Keras layer", "feature aggregation"], "summary_hash": "17b3d8dc3a36", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:02:15+00:00"}
