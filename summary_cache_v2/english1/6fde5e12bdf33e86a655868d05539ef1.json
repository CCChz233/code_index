{"summary": "This module defines a complex solver that encapsulates a logical NOT operation for infrastructure graph checks. It initializes with a child solver representing the operand and provides access to the stored operation for evaluation within the checking framework.", "business_intent": "Enable the definition and evaluation of negated compliance rules, allowing policies to specify conditions that must not be present in the infrastructure configuration.", "keywords": ["NOT", "logical negation", "solver", "complex solver", "infrastructure checks", "graph analysis", "policy evaluation", "condition wrapper", "compliance", "rule negation"], "summary_hash": "f48b5dc474c4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T19:46:28+00:00"}
