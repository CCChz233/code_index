{"summary": "The module implements a training pipeline that fine‑tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting model on user‑provided instance images and corresponding masks using the DreamBooth technique. It defines dataset utilities for loading and tokenizing images and prompts, prepares masked inputs, and orchestrates distributed training with the Accelerate library.", "business_intent": "Allow creators to quickly personalize diffusion‑based inpainting models for their own subjects, enabling customized image generation and editing for marketing, entertainment, or product design.", "keywords": ["DreamBooth", "inpainting", "Stable Diffusion", "diffusion model fine‑tuning", "PyTorch", "accelerated training", "mask preparation", "custom image generation", "CLIP tokenizer", "distributed training"], "summary_hash": "c6cb273761f6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:07:33+00:00"}
