{"summary": "The module implements a CLIP‑based text encoder that incorporates contextual information for use in diffusion pipelines. It provides neural components to generate contextual text embeddings, a transformer encoder compatible with CLIP, and utilities for handling attention masks.", "business_intent": "To enhance text conditioning in image‑text generative models by supplying richer, context‑aware textual representations, thereby improving the quality and relevance of diffusion‑based generation.", "keywords": ["CLIP", "text encoder", "contextual embeddings", "transformer", "diffusion pipeline", "BLIP", "attention mask", "PyTorch", "neural network", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "2274a097a798", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:18:02+00:00"}
