{"summary": "A training script that fine‑tunes a Stable Diffusion text‑to‑image model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with LoRA adapters. It leverages the Accelerate library for distributed training, prepares and tokenizes datasets, runs a training loop with gradient accumulation, schedules learning rates, periodically generates validation images, saves checkpoints, and can push the resulting model to a Hugging Face repository.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use pipeline for companies or researchers to align diffusion models with human preference data, improving generated image quality while keeping compute costs low through parameter-efficient LoRA fine‑tuning and scalable distributed training.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "stable diffusion", "DPO", "LoRA", "fine-tuning", "text-to-image", "accelerate", "distributed training", "huggingface", "validation", "checkpointing", "preference optimization"], "summary_hash": "154dab58e1af", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:06:36+00:00"}
