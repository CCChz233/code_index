{"summary": "The module implements utilities for loading and managing subject taxonomies used in annotation corpora. It supports multilingual CSV‑based vocabularies and single‑language TSV files, validates their structure, and can export them to SKOS. It also provides a bidirectional index linking numeric IDs to URIs and human‑readable labels, and a container for document‑level subject sets that enables parsing, comparison, and conversion to numeric vectors.", "business_intent": "Enable robust handling of subject vocabularies within a semantic indexing system, allowing easy ingestion, validation, lookup, and transformation of taxonomy data for downstream machine‑learning or information‑retrieval tasks.", "keywords": ["subject taxonomy", "CSV", "TSV", "SKOS", "identifier mapping", "label lookup", "vector representation", "corpus annotation", "vocabulary management", "semantic indexing"], "summary_hash": "82ed4b112dc7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:36:22+00:00"}
