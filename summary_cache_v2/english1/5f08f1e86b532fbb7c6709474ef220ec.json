{"summary": "The module implements a Cocke‑Younger‑Kasami (CYK) parser for the Lark library. It defines data structures to represent a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, productions, rule nodes, and unit‑skip handling, and provides a parser class that executes the CYK algorithm to construct parse trees. Helper utilities convert arbitrary grammars to CNF and manage unit rule transformations.", "business_intent": "Provide a deterministic, bottom‑up parsing engine that can process any context‑free grammar (once converted to CNF) within Lark, enabling language tools to perform syntax analysis and generate parse trees for complex or ambiguous grammars using the CYK algorithm.", "keywords": ["CYK", "parser", "Chomsky Normal Form", "CNF", "grammar", "parsing algorithm", "syntax tree", "Lark", "context‑free grammar", "unit rule"], "summary_hash": "c7ce73927a3a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:56:19+00:00"}
