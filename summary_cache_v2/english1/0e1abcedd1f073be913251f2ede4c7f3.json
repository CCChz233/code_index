{"summary": "This module implements a collection of GPU‑accelerated utilities for locating elements and indices within CuPy arrays, mirroring NumPy's search and conditional selection functions. It provides operations to find maximum/minimum positions, identify non‑zero entries, handle NaN‑aware reductions, and compute insertion points for sorted data.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑performance data analysis and scientific computing on NVIDIA GPUs by offering fast, NumPy‑compatible search and indexing primitives that simplify tasks such as finding extreme values, extracting element positions, and performing conditional selections on large arrays.", "keywords": ["GPU acceleration", "array indexing", "element location", "maximum index", "minimum index", "non‑zero elements", "NaN‑aware reduction", "insertion point", "conditional selection", "CuPy", "high‑performance computing"], "summary_hash": "3c230ed3f77e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:20:30+00:00"}
