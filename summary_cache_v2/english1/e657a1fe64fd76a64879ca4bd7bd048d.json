{"summary": "Represents the Hadamard gate, a single‑qubit operation that performs a π rotation about the X+Z axis, converting computational basis states |0⟩, |1⟩ into the superposition states |+⟩, |−⟩ and vice‑versa. The class encapsulates the gate’s matrix, circuit symbol, and integration with quantum circuits, and provides utilities for equality comparison, inversion, and controlled variants.", "business_intent": "Enable users of the quantum computing framework to easily apply the Hadamard transformation within circuits, facilitating creation of superposition and basis changes essential for quantum algorithms.", "keywords": ["Hadamard", "quantum gate", "single-qubit", "superposition", "basis change", "matrix", "quantum circuit", "controlled version", "inverse", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "5a1e2cdd8de3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:13:23+00:00"}
