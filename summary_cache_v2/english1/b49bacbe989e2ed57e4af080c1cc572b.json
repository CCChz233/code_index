{"summary": "The module provides utilities for representing and constructing string and byte literals in a form suitable for C code generation, handling encoding, escaping, and Unicode surrogate validation. It defines classes that encapsulate literals and builders that incrementally assemble them, along with helper functions for escaping characters and detecting problematic Unicode sequences.", "business_intent": "Enable the Cython compiler to correctly translate Python string and bytes objects into C‑compatible literals, ensuring proper UTF‑8 encoding, escape handling, and surrogate safety during code generation.", "keywords": ["Cython", "string encoding", "bytes literal", "Unicode handling", "escape sequences", "C‑style string", "literal builder", "surrogate detection", "code generation", "compiler utilities"], "summary_hash": "6b992904bff5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:26:29+00:00"}
