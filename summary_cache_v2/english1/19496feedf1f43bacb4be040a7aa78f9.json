{"summary": "The module defines a benchmarking suite for transformer attention decoding techniques. It supplies a common interface for decoding components and concrete implementations using FlashAttention, a repeated‑sequence PyTorch approach, and a split int4 quantized key/value cache strategy. Helper functions generate benchmark identifiers, perform int4 quantization, and run the benchmark harness, while test utilities validate the FlashAttention decoder.", "business_intent": "To measure and compare the inference speed and memory efficiency of different attention decoding methods, including high‑performance FlashAttention and low‑bit int4 KV caching, enabling developers to select optimal strategies for deploying transformer models in production.", "keywords": ["attention decoding", "benchmark", "FlashAttention", "PyTorch", "int4 quantization", "KV cache", "transformer inference", "performance evaluation", "xformers"], "summary_hash": "1d04155876f3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:28:09+00:00"}
