{"summary": "The module provides an example workflow for training and evaluating a graph neural network model on node classification data. It loads graph datasets, processes class identifiers, optionally applies dimensionality reduction to node features, builds a GCN or RECT model, runs training, and assesses embedding quality using evaluation utilities.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate how to apply the RECT architecture with PyTorch for node classification, offering a reference implementation that can be adapted for real-world graph learning projects.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "graph neural network", "node classification", "RECT", "GCN", "embedding evaluation", "data loading", "feature reduction", "label processing"], "summary_hash": "fb9d62e7c025", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:20:05+00:00"}
