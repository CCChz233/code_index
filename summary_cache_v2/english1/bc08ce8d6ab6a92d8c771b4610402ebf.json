{"summary": "The module implements a unittest suite that exercises the GibbsNoise image augmentation by applying it to synthetic 2D and 3D test images. It parametrically checks that the alpha parameter controls the noise strength, that an alpha of zero leaves the image unchanged, and that deterministic seeding yields repeatable outputs.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and reproducibility of the GibbsNoise transform to ensure reliable usage in medical imaging pipelines that rely on MONAI augmentations.", "keywords": ["GibbsNoise", "MONAI", "unit test", "image augmentation", "deterministic", "alpha parameter", "synthetic images", "2D", "3D", "parameterized", "unittest"], "summary_hash": "83dc0fceeed1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:54:20+00:00"}
