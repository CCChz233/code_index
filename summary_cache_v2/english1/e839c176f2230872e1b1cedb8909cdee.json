{"summary": "Implements a neural aligner model that learns to map mel‑spectrogram audio representations to corresponding text token sequences, generating fine‑grained timing alignments. The model incorporates specialized loss functions, attention binarization utilities, masking, and optional logging, and integrates with the NeMo and PyTorch‑Lightning training framework.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate speech‑text alignment for text‑to‑speech systems, supporting duration prediction and forced alignment to improve synthesis quality, facilitate voice editing, and provide data for downstream speech processing applications.", "keywords": ["aligner", "mel-spectrogram", "text tokens", "attention", "duration prediction", "forced alignment", "neural TTS", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "loss functions", "binarization", "logging"], "summary_hash": "35158d2ff1d1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:57:03+00:00"}
