{"summary": "The module implements dataset classes that download, preprocess, and expose Amazon and Yelp review fraud detection data as DGL graphs. Nodes represent users or reviews, edges encode shared product interactions, rating similarity, temporal proximity, and text similarity. Each graph includes handcrafted node features and binary fraud labels, with configurable random seeds, train/validation/test splits, and optional graph transformations for downstream graph neural network training.", "business_intent": "Provide ready‑to‑use graph‑structured fraud detection datasets to accelerate research and development of graph neural network models for identifying fraudulent reviewers and reviews in e‑commerce platforms.", "keywords": ["fraud detection", "graph neural networks", "DGL", "heterogeneous graph", "Amazon reviews", "Yelp reviews", "dataset", "node features", "edge types", "train validation split", "data preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "4d69ad515332", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:40:33+00:00"}
