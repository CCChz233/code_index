{"summary": "This module defines a handler that abstracts the process of obtaining text embeddings from OpenAI‑compatible services. It manages request construction, synchronous and asynchronous HTTP communication, error handling, and conversion of raw API responses into standardized embedding objects.", "business_intent": "Provide a unified, easy‑to‑use interface for generating vector embeddings across different OpenAI‑style providers, supporting both sync and async workflows to power AI features such as semantic search, recommendation, and similarity matching.", "keywords": ["embedding", "OpenAI-like", "API client", "asynchronous", "synchronous", "HTTP request", "error handling", "vector representation", "litellm"], "summary_hash": "d68a683b801f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:57:22+00:00"}
