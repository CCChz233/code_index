{"summary": "The module defines a hierarchy of particle classes for representing various types of particles in plasma physics. It includes abstract base classes that provide common functionality and concrete classes for custom particles, dimensionless particles, and standard particles. The Particle class handles parsing and validation of particle identifiers, provides properties for physical attributes such as mass, charge, and spin, and supports operations like inversion (to get antiparticle), addition (to create particle lists), and comparison. It also includes utility functions for categorizing particles and handling errors.", "business_intent": "To provide a flexible and robust framework for representing and manipulating particles in plasma physics simulations and calculations, enabling users to easily define custom particles, retrieve physical properties, and perform particle-based operations.", "keywords": ["particle", "plasma", "physics", "custom particle", "dimensionless particle", "mass", "charge", "spin", "antiparticle", "particle list", "validation", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "9d7eb94b922d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:04:57+00:00"}
