{"summary": "The module implements a collection of cryptographic utilities, including AES‑CMAC generation, counter‑mode key derivation, padding, XOR operations, and functions for encrypting and decrypting NTLM hashes and generic secrets, as well as key transformation helpers. Most of these routines are currently isolated and not referenced elsewhere in the codebase.", "business_intent": "Provide low‑level cryptographic building blocks needed for authentication and credential handling, such as generating message authentication codes, deriving keys, and protecting NTLM hash values within security‑related workflows.", "keywords": ["cryptography", "AES-CMAC", "KDF", "counter mode", "NTLM hash encryption", "padding", "XOR", "key derivation", "secret handling", "impacket"], "summary_hash": "ce3d45265384", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:10:03+00:00"}
