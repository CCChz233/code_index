{"summary": "The class extracts pitch-related features from audio signals, handling optional saving of pitch contours, voiced masks, and voiced probability maps. It supports configurable sample rate, frame size, hop size, pitch range, volume normalization, and batch processing to manage memory for long recordings.", "business_intent": "Enable automated pitch analysis within audio processing pipelines for applications such as speech recognition, music analysis, and acoustic research.", "keywords": ["pitch extraction", "audio feature computation", "voiced detection", "batch processing", "sample rate configuration", "window and hop length", "volume normalization", "feature saving"], "summary_hash": "27b4f9383558", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:47:31+00:00"}
