{"summary": "A modular wrapper that turns a generic one‑stage anchor‑based network into a full object detector. It creates anchors, matches them to ground‑truth, computes classification and bounding‑box regression losses during training, and post‑processes raw predictions into final boxes, labels and scores for inference. The class supports 2‑D and 3‑D inputs, variable image sizes, and configurable components such as matchers, samplers, loss functions and sliding‑window inference.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to build, train, and deploy anchor‑based object detection models—particularly for medical imaging—without having to implement the low‑level detection pipeline, thereby accelerating research and clinical application development.", "keywords": ["object detection", "anchor based", "RetinaNet", "one‑stage detector", "classification loss", "box regression loss", "training", "inference", "2D", "3D", "medical imaging", "MONAI", "anchor generation", "post‑processing", "matcher", "sampler", "sliding window"], "summary_hash": "bc405202f3ce", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:15:54+00:00"}
