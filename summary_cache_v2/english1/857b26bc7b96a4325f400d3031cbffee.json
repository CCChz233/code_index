{"summary": "Provides an analysis pass that inspects a circuit’s directed‑acyclic‑graph representation to determine whether all two‑qubit operations are already placed on qubit pairs that are directly connected in the device’s coupling map (or target). The outcome is stored as a boolean property for downstream passes.", "business_intent": "Enable transpilation workflows to skip unnecessary routing or swap insertion when a circuit is already compatible with the hardware connectivity, thereby reducing compilation time and circuit depth.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "mapping verification", "coupling map", "hardware connectivity", "transpiler analysis pass", "DAG representation", "target device", "swap avoidance", "property flag"], "summary_hash": "80ca78707372", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:26:12+00:00"}
