{"summary": "The module implements a training pipeline for a hierarchical graph neural network applied to supervised community detection. It loads a synthetic stochastic block model mixture dataset, constructs the line‑graph based GNN, configures optimization, runs epoch‑wise training steps, performs inference on validation and test splits, and reports the overlap metric to assess community recovery.", "business_intent": "Provide a reproducible example that demonstrates how hierarchical GNNs can be trained and evaluated for community detection, enabling researchers and developers to benchmark and extend supervised graph clustering methods.", "keywords": ["community detection", "graph neural network", "hierarchical GNN", "supervised learning", "DGL", "PyTorch", "stochastic block model", "line graph", "training script", "overlap metric"], "summary_hash": "53b4d66cd250", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:13:35+00:00"}
