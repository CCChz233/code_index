{"summary": "Applies a scaling (zoom) transformation to N‑dimensional images using PyTorch’s interpolate function. The transform accepts per‑axis zoom factors, chooses interpolation and padding modes, optionally preserves the original spatial dimensions by padding or cropping, and can operate lazily to defer computation.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible, high‑performance image resampling in medical imaging and deep‑learning pipelines, allowing users to enlarge or shrink images while maintaining size consistency and supporting deferred execution for efficiency.", "keywords": ["zoom", "interpolation", "scaling", "resampling", "lazy execution", "padding", "keep size", "torch", "ndimage", "medical imaging", "align_corners", "dtype"], "summary_hash": "85a69adcb15b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:06:50+00:00"}
