{"summary": "Provides unit tests for DynamoDB Streams using a mocked AWS environment. The tests cover core stream operations such as describing streams, listing streams, obtaining shard iterators at different positions, and reading records (including empty and sequential reads). Additional tests verify edge‑case behavior like stream activation on tables and handling of range‑key scenarios.", "business_intent": "Validate that the application's integration with DynamoDB Streams works correctly and remains robust against regressions, ensuring proper stream handling and edge‑case support before deployment.", "keywords": ["DynamoDB Streams", "unit testing", "boto3", "moto", "pytest", "stream description", "shard iterator", "record retrieval", "stream activation", "range key"], "summary_hash": "e69dce2f9bd9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:28:43+00:00"}
