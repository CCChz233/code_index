{"summary": "A command‑line training script that fine‑tunes the Kandinsky 2.2 text‑to‑image diffusion model using Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It loads a dataset, applies preprocessing and augmentation, configures the diffusion UNet and VQ model with LoRA attention processors, sets up an optimizer and learning‑rate scheduler, runs distributed training with Accelerate, evaluates generation quality, saves checkpoints and optionally publishes the adapted model to the Hugging Face hub.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use pipeline for enterprises and developers to efficiently customize a large text‑to‑image diffusion model for their own visual style or domain, lowering computational cost and storage while enabling proprietary image generation services.", "keywords": ["Kandinsky", "text-to-image", "diffusion model", "LoRA", "fine-tuning", "training script", "accelerate", "dataset preprocessing", "checkpointing", "Hugging Face hub"], "summary_hash": "0b4c7ec37423", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:08:52+00:00"}
