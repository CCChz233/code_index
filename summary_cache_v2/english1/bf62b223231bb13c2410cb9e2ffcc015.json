{"summary": "The module orchestrates forced alignment of speech audio against reference transcripts using NVIDIA NeMo ASR models (CTC and hybrid RNNT-CTC). It prepares data batches, runs streaming inference, applies Viterbi decoding to obtain word‑level timestamps, and writes alignment results into subtitle (ASS) and time‑mark (CTM) files as well as output manifests.", "business_intent": "Provide an automated pipeline for generating precise timing information for spoken content, enabling subtitle creation, transcription verification, and downstream speech analytics.", "keywords": ["forced alignment", "NeMo", "ASR", "CTC model", "RNNT model", "Viterbi decoding", "transcript timestamps", "ASS file", "CTM file", "manifest generation", "audio processing"], "summary_hash": "8164c9e91d02", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:24:17+00:00"}
