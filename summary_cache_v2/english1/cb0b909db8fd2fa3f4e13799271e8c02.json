{"summary": "The module provides a VITS (Variational Inference Text-to-Speech) model implementation for the NeMo framework. It encapsulates model construction (generator and multi‑period discriminator), data preparation with bucket sampling, loss computation (generator, discriminator, KL divergence, feature‑matching), optimizer and cosine‑annealing learning‑rate configuration, mixed‑precision and gradient‑clipping support, optional experiment logging, and inference methods that convert tokenized text (and optional speaker embeddings) into high‑quality audio waveforms.", "business_intent": "To deliver a ready‑to‑train, high‑fidelity neural TTS solution that can be customized for various voice applications—such as virtual assistants, audiobooks, and accessibility tools—by enabling efficient training, fine‑tuning, and deployment of VITS‑based speech synthesis models.", "keywords": ["VITS", "text-to-speech", "neural TTS", "audio synthesis", "generator", "discriminator", "KL divergence", "feature matching loss", "training pipeline", "inference", "mixed precision", "gradient clipping", "cosine annealing scheduler", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "multi‑period discriminator", "speaker embedding"], "summary_hash": "093db37ff862", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:01:56+00:00"}
