{"summary": "This module provides dictionary‑based wrappers for MONAI's spatial array transforms, allowing common geometric operations such as affine, rotation, flip, elastic deformation, grid distortion, resizing, spacing adjustment, and resampling to be applied directly to selected keys within a data dictionary. The wrappers handle metadata updates, support lazy execution to defer actual resampling, and maintain invertibility where applicable.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible, key‑driven spatial preprocessing and data augmentation for medical imaging pipelines that use dictionary‑structured inputs, simplifying integration of complex geometric transforms while preserving metadata and supporting efficient lazy computation.", "keywords": ["dictionary transforms", "spatial augmentation", "medical imaging", "affine", "rotation", "flip", "elastic deformation", "grid distortion", "resize", "spacing", "resample", "lazy execution", "metadata handling", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "ae67a61e92a7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:23:59+00:00"}
