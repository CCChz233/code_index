{"summary": "Provides a lazy iterator that reads NeMo tarred JSON manifests and associated tar files, converting each entry into a Lhotse Cut on demand. It extracts required fields (audio path, duration, transcript, shard id), maps optional language information, attaches any additional manifest keys as custom metadata, and supports flexible input specifications including pipe commands for cloud storage. The iterator can shuffle shards using a configurable random seed, enabling efficient streaming of large, sharded speech corpora directly into a Lhotse CutSet.", "business_intent": "Facilitate scalable, on‑the‑fly loading and preprocessing of massive speech datasets stored in NeMo tarred format for speech recognition and related AI pipelines, reducing memory footprint and allowing distributed data loading with optional shuffling and cloud‑native access.", "keywords": ["lazy loading", "NeMo tarred manifest", "Lhotse Cut", "sharding", "streaming audio", "custom metadata", "pipe specifier", "cloud storage", "inter‑shard shuffling", "random seed"], "summary_hash": "15c48e273991", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:31:15+00:00"}
