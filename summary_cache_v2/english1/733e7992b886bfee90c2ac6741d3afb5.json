{"summary": "Applies gamma correction to an input tensor representing an image, optionally scaling the result with a gain factor. The operation works element‑wise on values assumed to be in the [0,1] interval and supports broadcasting of per‑sample parameters.", "business_intent": "Provides a lightweight preprocessing step for computer‑vision pipelines to adjust image brightness and contrast before feeding data into neural networks.", "keywords": ["gamma correction", "image preprocessing", "contrast adjustment", "gain scaling", "torch tensor", "brightness control", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "d74f21d9f916", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:50:42+00:00"}
