{"summary": "A scheduler that first ramps up the learning rate over a specified number of warm‑up steps using a polynomial (default linear) curve, then hands control to a provided decay schedule for the remainder of training. The object is callable and returns the appropriate learning rate for any step.", "business_intent": "Enable more stable and efficient model training by preventing large initial updates, thereby improving convergence and performance in machine learning workflows.", "keywords": ["learning rate warmup", "polynomial warmup", "learning rate decay", "training scheduler", "optimizer schedule", "gradient stability", "machine learning"], "summary_hash": "ea42479c36ee", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:25:04+00:00"}
