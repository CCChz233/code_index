{"summary": "Implements cross‑platform mechanisms to attach to a running Python interpreter and inject arbitrary Python code. On Windows it creates and loads a helper DLL, using mutexes and shared memory to coordinate injection. On Linux and macOS it drives gdb to call the target process’s tracing functions. Includes utilities for locating helper scripts, determining the target’s bitness, and managing synchronization objects.", "business_intent": "Enable external tools to dynamically instrument, trace, or debug a live Python process without restarting it, facilitating runtime profiling and debugging.", "keywords": ["code injection", "process attachment", "cross‑platform", "DLL injection", "gdb", "Python tracing", "runtime instrumentation", "viztracer", "debugging", "profiling"], "summary_hash": "ff8fad25d824", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:35:38+00:00"}
