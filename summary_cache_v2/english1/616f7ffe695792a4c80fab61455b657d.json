{"summary": "A configurable module that derives line segment representations from detected junction points and line heatmaps. It applies thresholding, sampling, candidate suppression, non‑maximum suppression, and optional heatmap and junction refinement to produce a line map and refined junction set.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream computer‑vision applications—such as mapping, architectural analysis, or autonomous navigation—to obtain accurate, clean line segment data from raw detection outputs.", "keywords": ["line segment detection", "heatmap processing", "junction recovery", "candidate suppression", "non‑maximum suppression", "thresholding", "sampling", "refinement", "configurable parameters", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "e2eab3489fd9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:01:06+00:00"}
