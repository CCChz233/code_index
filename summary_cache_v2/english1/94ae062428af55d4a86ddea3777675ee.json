{"summary": "The module defines a set of dataclasses that model JUnit XML structures such as test cases, errors, failures, test results, test suites, and collections of suites. Each class stores relevant attributes, provides read‑only accessors and status checks, and can render itself as an XML element. Helper utilities format attribute dictionaries and pretty‑print the final XML document.", "business_intent": "To generate standards‑compliant JUnit XML reports from Python test executions, allowing continuous‑integration pipelines and other tools to consume detailed test outcomes, including successes, skips, errors, and failures.", "keywords": ["junit", "xml", "test report", "dataclasses", "test case", "test suite", "error handling", "failure reporting", "ci integration", "serialization"], "summary_hash": "42d2ed194095", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:33:09+00:00"}
