{"summary": "This module defines the Pauli‑X gate and a suite of its controlled variants, ranging from the two‑qubit CNOT to three‑qubit Toffoli and arbitrary‑size multi‑controlled NOT gates. It provides several concrete decompositions (relative‑phase, Gray‑code, recursive, V‑chain, etc.) and handles ancilla management, matrix definitions, and circuit integration.", "business_intent": "Supply quantum programmers with ready‑to‑use, efficiently decomposed X‑type gates for building and simulating quantum circuits, supporting algorithms that require conditional bit flips and complex multi‑control operations.", "keywords": ["Pauli-X", "controlled NOT", "CNOT", "Toffoli", "multi-controlled X", "quantum gate", "Qiskit", "circuit library", "ancilla", "gate decomposition", "Gray code", "recursive construction", "relative phase"], "summary_hash": "eae769db36bd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:13:37+00:00"}
