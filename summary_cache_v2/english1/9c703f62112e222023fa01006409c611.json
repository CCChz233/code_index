{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that accepts an input image (and optional text prompt) and generates varied versions of the image using the UnCLIP architecture. It encodes the image and prompt, prepares latent tensors, runs a decoder diffusion step followed by super‑resolution diffusion steps, and outputs the resulting images.", "business_intent": "Provide a tool for automatically creating multiple creative variations of existing images, supporting design iteration, marketing asset generation, and data augmentation in AI‑driven content creation workflows.", "keywords": ["image variation", "diffusion pipeline", "UnCLIP", "text encoder", "image encoder", "decoder", "super-resolution", "latent preparation", "scheduler", "generative AI", "content creation"], "summary_hash": "2a5fc5ad471a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:16:26+00:00"}
