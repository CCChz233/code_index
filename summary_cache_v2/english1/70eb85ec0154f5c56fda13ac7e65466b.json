It provides classes that compute pairwise similarity scores using embedding models and a cross‑encoder, optionally applying a threshold to produce binary similarity judgments, and supports ranking of answer pairs for evaluation of generation quality.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and data scientists to assess and compare the relevance and correctness of generated responses against reference answers, facilitating the evaluation and improvement of retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) systems and conversational AI applications.", "keywords": ["answer similarity", "semantic similarity", "cross‑encoder", "embeddings", "metric", "evaluation", "RAG", "NLP", "threshold", "ranking"], "summary_hash": "c49f9e18f871", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:50:26+00:00"}
