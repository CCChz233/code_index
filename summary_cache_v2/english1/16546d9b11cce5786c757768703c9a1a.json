{"summary": "The module provides synthetic graph datasets for classification and node classification tasks, including BA2MotifDataset, BACommunityDataset, BAShapeDataset, TreeCycleDataset, and TreeGridDataset. These datasets generate graphs with specific structures (Barabási–Albert base, motifs, trees, cycles, grids) and assign labels and features for machine learning experiments.", "business_intent": "To offer ready-to-use synthetic graph datasets for benchmarking graph neural network models and explanation methods, facilitating research and development in graph learning.", "keywords": ["synthetic graph dataset", "graph classification", "node classification", "Barabási–Albert", "motif", "tree", "grid", "cycle", "GNNExplainer", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "7a255a867740", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:39:49+00:00"}
