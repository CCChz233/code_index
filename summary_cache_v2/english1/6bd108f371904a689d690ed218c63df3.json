{"summary": "A benchmark script that compares the performance and accuracy of the Accelerate library against native MS-AMP when training models with FP8 precision using Distributed Data Parallel (DDP). It runs baseline and integrated training loops, evaluates the results, and checks for parity between the two approaches.", "business_intent": "Validate that the Accelerate integration with FP8 and DDP delivers the same training quality and speed as the original MS-AMP implementation, providing confidence for deploying Accelerate in high‑performance, distributed training pipelines.", "keywords": ["benchmark", "FP8", "MS-AMP", "Accelerate", "Distributed Data Parallel", "DDP", "training performance", "evaluation", "gradient scaling", "seed reproducibility", "model metric"], "summary_hash": "f376438d78ec", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:16:07+00:00"}
