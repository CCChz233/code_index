{"summary": "A command‑line utility that builds, trains, and evaluates a Deep Generative Model of Graphs (DGMG) using PyTorch. It handles argument parsing, dataset loading, model instantiation, optimizer setup, a single‑sample training loop with gradient clipping, periodic validation, checkpoint saving, and optional graph generation for inference.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to reproduce the DGMG approach from the cited paper, experiment with graph generation models, and integrate the training pipeline into their own graph‑learning workflows.", "keywords": ["deep generative model", "graph generation", "PyTorch", "training loop", "optimizer", "gradient clipping", "data loader", "inference", "graph neural network", "research reproducibility"], "summary_hash": "7173cefa882f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:24:15+00:00"}
