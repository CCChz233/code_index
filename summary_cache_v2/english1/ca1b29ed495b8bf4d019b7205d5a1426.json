{"summary": "A utility script that transforms AuraFlow transformer checkpoints into a format compatible with the Hugging Face Diffusers library. It loads the original state dictionary, adjusts parameter ordering (e.g., swapping scale and shift tensors), computes necessary layer configurations, populates a Diffusers model's state dict, and prepares the model for downstream use.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless migration of AuraFlow models to the Diffusers ecosystem, allowing developers to reuse existing checkpoints with Diffusers pipelines for image generation or other diffusion tasks.", "keywords": ["model conversion", "AuraFlow", "Diffusers", "checkpoint", "state dict", "PyTorch", "Hugging Face", "transformer", "parameter mapping", "scale shift swap"], "summary_hash": "5b3417e59524", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:43:26+00:00"}
