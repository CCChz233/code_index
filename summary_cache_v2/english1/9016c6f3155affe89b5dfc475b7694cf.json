{"summary": "This module defines abstract base classes that encapsulate the core functionality of a quantum circuit sampler primitive. They manage circuit and parameter preparation, default shot handling, job submission, and result packaging, while delegating the actual execution to concrete subclass implementations.", "business_intent": "Offer a reusable foundation for developers to implement sampler primitives that can be integrated into Qiskit’s runtime, enabling consistent generation of measurement outcome distributions from quantum circuits for quantum algorithm development and execution.", "keywords": ["sampler", "quantum circuit", "measurement", "probability distribution", "abstract base class", "job management", "shots", "result", "Qiskit", "primitive", "execution", "backend"], "summary_hash": "04a1a18981c6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:22:19+00:00"}
