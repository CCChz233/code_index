{"summary": "The module provides a collection of helper functions that retrieve and prepare various example datasets—such as topographic, hydraulic, meteorological, and river network data—for groundwater modeling workflows. It uses a pooch registry to manage downloading the sample files and returns them in convenient formats like pandas DataFrames, xarray Datasets, and xugrid objects.", "business_intent": "Enable users, developers, and analysts to quickly access realistic sample data for setting up, testing, and demonstrating groundwater flow simulations and related hydrological analyses, thereby reducing the effort required to gather and preprocess example datasets.", "keywords": ["sample data", "groundwater modeling", "hydrology", "pooch", "dataset loading", "xarray", "pandas", "xugrid", "simulation", "test data"], "summary_hash": "fe9725c45a69", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:46:10+00:00"}
