{"summary": "The module offers utilities to transform PyTorch model state dictionaries by defining pattern‑based key mappings, supporting wildcards, and applying custom callables to the matched values. It includes a class that encapsulates the mapping logic and several helper functions for default transformations, key matching, applying a set of transforms, and wrapping functionality.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless migration, compatibility, and adaptation of model checkpoints across different versions or architectures by providing a flexible, programmable way to rename and modify state‑dict entries during loading or saving.", "keywords": ["state dict", "transformation", "key mapping", "wildcard", "checkpoint", "PyTorch", "model compatibility", "utility"], "summary_hash": "d77e10cf13ff", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:49:57+00:00"}
