{"summary": "The module defines neural models for detecting unsafe or adult content by leveraging CLIP vision‑language embeddings and a Megatron‑based language model. It includes a core content‑filtering component that loads concept definitions, computes similarity scores, and outputs classification decisions, as well as a Megatron wrapper that manages the full training, validation, and inference pipeline for content‑filtering tasks.", "business_intent": "Provide an automated, high‑performance solution for content moderation and safety enforcement in applications that process multimodal data, helping platforms filter NSFW or harmful material.", "keywords": ["content filtering", "NSFW detection", "CLIP embeddings", "Megatron", "vision-language model", "multimodal safety", "similarity scoring", "classification", "training pipeline", "moderation"], "summary_hash": "11dd17d20297", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:05:57+00:00"}
