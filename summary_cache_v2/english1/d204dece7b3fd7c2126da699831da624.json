{"summary": "The module defines a wrapper that extends automatic speech recognition models to produce time‑aligned transcription outputs. It abstracts differences between CTC and RNNT architectures, applies probability suppression, converts token sequences to words, formats results as CTM units, and supplies utilities for preparing training, validation, and test datasets.", "business_intent": "Enable precise speech‑to‑text alignment for applications such as forced alignment, evaluation, and downstream processing by providing a unified interface that works with various ASR model types.", "keywords": ["speech recognition", "alignment", "CTC", "RNNT", "CTM", "token conversion", "probability suppression", "dataset preparation", "wrapper model", "NeMo", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "205ac68061e3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:11:05+00:00"}
