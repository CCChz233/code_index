{"summary": "This module implements the internal data‑handling layer of the Lightning PyTorch trainer. It coordinates the attachment of user‑provided datasets, DataLoaders, and DataModules, resolves appropriate samplers, adapts them for distributed strategies, validates and processes loaders (including combined loaders), and offers a unified mechanism to retrieve data‑related hooks (train/val/test/predict) from either the model or a data module.", "business_intent": "To abstract and automate the complexities of data preparation for model training, validation, testing, and prediction, ensuring correct sampler configuration, distributed compatibility, and hook selection so that users can focus on model logic without manual data‑pipeline plumbing.", "keywords": ["data connector", "dataloader preparation", "sampler resolution", "distributed training", "data module", "hook selector", "overfit batches", "combined loader", "PyTorch Lightning", "training engine integration"], "summary_hash": "0d1791082a41", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:00:33+00:00"}
