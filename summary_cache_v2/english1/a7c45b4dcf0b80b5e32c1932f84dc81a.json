{"summary": "The module defines a class that represents a Boolean logic function and provides mechanisms to create a quantum oracle from a logical expression or a DIMACS‑formatted file. It supports loading, simulating, and synthesizing the Boolean function into a quantum circuit representation suitable for execution on quantum hardware.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to transform classical Boolean specifications into quantum oracles, facilitating the integration of classical logic into quantum algorithms, simulation of their behavior, and preparation of hardware‑compatible circuit implementations.", "keywords": ["quantum oracle", "Boolean expression", "DIMACS", "classical function", "circuit synthesis", "simulation", "Qiskit", "quantum circuit", "logic gate", "hardware representation"], "summary_hash": "c956ca814ec0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:10:30+00:00"}
