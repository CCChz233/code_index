{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests and supporting helpers that validate the functionality of a genomic variant lookup library. It checks the string representation, genomic span, and type of simple variant objects, exercises overlap detection, minor allele frequency calculations, and verifies proper error handling when VCF or index files are missing.", "business_intent": "To ensure the reliability and correctness of the variant lookup API used in genomic analyses by automatically testing core features such as variant conversion, overlap queries, allele frequency computation, and robust handling of missing data files.", "keywords": ["genomic variant", "variant lookup", "unit testing", "SimpleVariant", "VCF", "overlap detection", "minor allele frequency", "error handling", "pytest", "bioinformatics"], "summary_hash": "30f6bfa325c2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:10:57+00:00"}
