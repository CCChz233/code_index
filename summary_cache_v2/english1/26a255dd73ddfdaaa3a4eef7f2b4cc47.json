{"summary": "Provides a lightweight evaluator that runs a SentenceTransformer model against a collection of reduced-size BEIR datasets, computes standard information‑retrieval metrics (e.g., MRR, nDCG, Recall@k) for each dataset and aggregates them, and formats the results for reporting.", "business_intent": "Enables fast, cost‑effective benchmarking of embedding‑based retrieval models so developers can quickly gauge performance and make model‑selection or tuning decisions before committing to full‑scale evaluation.", "keywords": ["sentence transformer", "information retrieval", "benchmark", "nano-beir", "retrieval metrics", "MRR", "nDCG", "Recall", "quick evaluation", "model selection"], "summary_hash": "71fbd58be6f3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:47:25+00:00"}
