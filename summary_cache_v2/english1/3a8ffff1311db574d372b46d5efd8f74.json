{"summary": "A command‑line utility that applies Noisy Channel Reranking to machine‑translation beam outputs. It combines scores from a forward NMT model, a reverse (target‑to‑source) model, and a target language model using configurable coefficients, then re‑orders the candidate translations. The tool also supports re‑ranking solely from previously cached NCR scores for coefficient tuning.", "business_intent": "Enhance the accuracy and fluency of neural machine‑translation results by leveraging a noisy‑channel score fusion approach, allowing developers and researchers to improve translation quality without retraining models.", "keywords": ["machine translation", "noisy channel reranking", "beam search", "score fusion", "language model", "reverse model", "coefficient tuning", "NeMo", "inference", "translation quality"], "summary_hash": "e5d5862027a6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:42:10+00:00"}
