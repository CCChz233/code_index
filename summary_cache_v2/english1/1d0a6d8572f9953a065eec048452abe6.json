{"summary": "The script sets up and runs training for a graph neural network on the Lander dataset using DGL's subgraph sampling. It handles command‑line argument parsing, dataset loading, sampler and data loader creation, model instantiation, optimizer configuration, the training loop with timing and checkpointing, and optional evaluation.", "business_intent": "Offer a clear example of how to train a subgraph‑based GNN with PyTorch and DGL, serving as a reference implementation for developers and researchers working on graph learning and image clustering tasks.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "DGL", "graph neural network", "subgraph sampling", "training script", "LANDER model", "Lander dataset", "optimizer", "data loader", "example implementation"], "summary_hash": "7876d05c396a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:51:18+00:00"}
