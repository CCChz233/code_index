{"summary": "The module defines a test suite that verifies gradient‑based visualization methods (Vanilla Grad, Guided Backpropagation, Smooth Grad) for various MONAI network architectures such as DenseNet and SEResNet. It includes a helper callable that computes adjoint gradients for a DenseNet model and a collection of parameterized unit tests that check output shapes and basic properties of the generated class activation maps.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and stability of interpretability tools used to explain deep learning models in medical imaging, ensuring that gradient‑based visual explanations produce expected dimensions and behavior across different network configurations.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "gradient visualization", "class activation map", "guided backpropagation", "smooth grad", "vanilla grad", "DenseNet", "SEResNet", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "PyTorch", "parameterized testing"], "summary_hash": "3f3e72c67f86", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:28:15+00:00"}
