{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that combines a HunyuanDiT text-to-image model with pixel‑attention guidance (PAG) to generate images from textual prompts. The module orchestrates model loading, tokenization, attention processing, image decoding, safety checking, and scheduler stepping, while providing utilities for image resizing, shape mapping, and noise configuration scaling.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and enterprises to integrate advanced, high‑fidelity text‑to‑image generation—particularly for Chinese language prompts—into creative, marketing, and design workflows, with built‑in safety checks and flexible configuration.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "text-to-image", "HunyuanDiT", "pixel attention guidance", "image generation", "safety checker", "scheduler", "tokenizer", "autoencoder", "attention processor", "image resizing", "noise scaling"], "summary_hash": "489b4c6dfbdf", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:17:11+00:00"}
