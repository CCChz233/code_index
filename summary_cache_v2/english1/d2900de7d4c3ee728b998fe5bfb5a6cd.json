{"summary": "The module defines a base renderer for neural volume rendering using the nerfacc library. It handles occupancy grid evaluation, step progression, and forward computation within a NeRF-based pipeline. It also provides helper functions for mapping namedtuples and constructing density and color functions for rendering.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient neural rendering for 3D scene synthesis, view synthesis, and related multimodal AI applications.", "keywords": ["NeRF", "nerfacc", "volume rendering", "occupancy grid", "ray marching", "neural rendering", "multimodal AI", "accelerated rendering", "density function", "color function"], "summary_hash": "db6a4eb48dc1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:03:25+00:00"}
