{"summary": "The Estimator class implements the core functionality of a BaseEstimator, providing a unified interface to compute expectation values. It supports exact calculation when no shot limit is set, or stochastic sampling using a normal‑distribution approximation when a finite number of shots is specified. A configurable random seed or generator ensures reproducible sampling.", "business_intent": "Enable users to obtain expectation values from quantum or statistical models with flexible precision—either exact results for analytical workflows or sampled estimates for performance‑constrained scenarios—while maintaining reproducibility.", "keywords": ["estimator", "expectation value", "shots", "sampling", "normal distribution", "random seed", "reproducibility", "quantum", "approximation", "BaseEstimator"], "summary_hash": "c6c0752621ae", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:07:08+00:00"}
