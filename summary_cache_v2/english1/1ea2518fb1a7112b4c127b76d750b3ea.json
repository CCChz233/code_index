{"summary": "A dataset wrapper that loads, caches, and serves nine benchmark graph classification collections used in the GIN paper. It downloads raw files if needed, processes them into DGL graphs with optional self‑loops and degree‑based node labels, and provides node attributes or one‑hot encodings. The object behaves like a sequence, allowing indexed access to (graph, label) pairs and reporting the total number of classes.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to quickly obtain standardized graph classification datasets for training and evaluating graph neural network models, with configurable preprocessing such as self‑loops and degree labeling, while handling data retrieval, caching, and batching transparently.", "keywords": ["graph classification", "benchmark datasets", "GNN", "DGL", "self‑loop", "node degree label", "caching", "download", "processing", "graph isomorphism network"], "summary_hash": "3bf6382728c6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:45:30+00:00"}
