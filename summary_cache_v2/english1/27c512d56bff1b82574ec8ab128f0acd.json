{"summary": "Provides a suite of helper utilities for MONAI neural network modules, including temporary dtype casting wrappers, automatic float casting for ONNX export, functions to replace or wrap sub-modules, and tools to convert models to ONNX, TorchScript, or TensorRT formats. It also handles state‑dict management, layer freezing, batch‑size scaling, and profiling shape extraction to streamline model preparation and deployment.", "business_intent": "Facilitate flexible preparation, modification, and export of deep learning models in MONAI, ensuring compatibility with multiple inference runtimes (ONNX, TorchScript, TensorRT) while managing datatype casting, module substitution, and model state.", "keywords": ["model conversion", "ONNX export", "TorchScript", "TensorRT", "dtype casting", "module replacement", "state dict handling", "layer freezing", "batch size scaling", "profiling shapes"], "summary_hash": "f880a128bdfa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:28:30+00:00"}
