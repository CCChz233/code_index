{"summary": "The module defines a legacy ONNX‑based Stable Diffusion inpainting pipeline that takes an input image, a mask, and a text prompt, encodes the prompt, runs denoising steps with various schedulers, decodes the latent representation back to an image, and applies safety checks. It also includes utility routines for preparing images and masks before inference.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, hardware‑agnostic image editing by filling masked regions guided by natural language descriptions, supporting applications such as content creation, photo retouching, and automated visual asset generation.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion", "inpainting", "ONNX", "legacy pipeline", "text‑guided image editing", "mask processing", "diffusion scheduler", "safety checker", "image generation", "preprocessing utilities"], "summary_hash": "828ba573ad39", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:27:42+00:00"}
