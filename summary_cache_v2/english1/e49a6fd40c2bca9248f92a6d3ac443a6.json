{"summary": "This module implements the core runtime infrastructure for evaluating Amazon Step Functions state machines within the Moto mock environment. It defines data structures for execution metadata, synchronization primitives for parallel branches, a context object that tracks frames, events, callbacks, and map‑run records, and abstractions representing the current execution status.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to test and simulate Step Functions workflows locally without invoking real AWS services, by providing a faithful in‑process execution engine that mirrors AWS execution behavior.", "keywords": ["Step Functions", "Amazon States Language", "execution context", "runtime environment", "mock AWS", "synchronization", "state machine evaluation", "metadata tracking", "concurrency handling"], "summary_hash": "eeb6cfc61af1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:59:01+00:00"}
