{"summary": "Encapsulates a deep‑learning model that transforms audio signals, managing the full lifecycle from data preparation through training, validation, testing and inference. It configures dataloaders, loss functions, metrics, optimization settings, and handles batch processing, evaluation aggregation and post‑processing of audio outputs.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to integrate an audio‑to‑audio transformation capability—such as speech enhancement, source separation, or style transfer—into AI products with minimal boilerplate, supporting scalable training and reliable evaluation.", "keywords": ["audio processing", "deep learning model", "training pipeline", "validation", "testing", "data loading", "loss function", "metrics", "optimization", "batch handling", "inference", "audio transformation"], "summary_hash": "19825249b8db", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:21:22+00:00"}
