{"summary": "Implements a parallel transport model solver that employs Krylov subspace iterative methods to resolve concentration fields across a discretized domain, supporting configurable outer and inner iteration limits, convergence tolerances, relaxation factors, and selectable linear solvers with preconditioning. The solver partitions the computational grid (uniformly or via recursive coordinate bisection) and optionally uses a user‑provided load‑balance weight grid to distribute work across processors.", "business_intent": "Accelerate large‑scale contaminant transport simulations in hydrogeological models by leveraging parallel computation and advanced iterative solvers, thereby reducing runtime and enabling more detailed or nonlinear sorption analyses.", "keywords": ["parallel computing", "Krylov iterative solver", "transport modeling", "domain partitioning", "load balancing", "convergence tolerance", "relaxation parameter", "preconditioner", "bicgstab", "gmres", "gcr", "recursive coordinate bisection"], "summary_hash": "e88d2bd6f7a4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:33:07+00:00"}
