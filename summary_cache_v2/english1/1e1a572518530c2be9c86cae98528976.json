{"summary": "Implements a diffusion‑based pipeline that converts textual prompts (and optionally reference images) into latent image embeddings suitable for the Kandinsky V2.2 model. It orchestrates a prior transformer, CLIP‑based text and vision encoders, tokenization, and a scheduler to produce and manipulate embeddings, handling encoding, timestep management, zero‑embedding defaults, interpolation and latent preparation.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to generate high‑quality image priors from text, facilitating AI‑driven artwork creation, rapid prototyping of visual concepts, and integration of Kandinsky’s generative capabilities into applications such as design tools, marketing assets, and creative platforms.", "keywords": ["image prior", "diffusion pipeline", "text-to-image", "embedding generation", "CLIP encoder", "scheduler", "latent preparation", "interpolation", "Kandinsky V2.2", "AI art"], "summary_hash": "692e7c8e5bfc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:25:21+00:00"}
