{"summary": "The module implements a stochastic iterative scheduler for consistency models, managing the sigma schedule, noise injection, input scaling, and optional output clipping to support both multistep and single‑step generation. It also defines a lightweight output container for the previous‑timestep sample required by the denoising loop.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable and flexible sampling of consistency‑based generative models within diffusion pipelines, allowing developers to generate high‑quality images or data with configurable step strategies and noise handling.", "keywords": ["scheduler", "consistency model", "stochastic iterative", "sigma schedule", "noise injection", "denoising", "sampling", "multistep", "single-step", "PyTorch", "configuration", "output container"], "summary_hash": "e15345019eea", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:12:24+00:00"}
