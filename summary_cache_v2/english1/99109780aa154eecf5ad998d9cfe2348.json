{"summary": "This module implements a comprehensive configuration system for the Prefect platform. It defines typed setting descriptors, builds a dynamic Pydantic settings model, and manages a thread‑ and async‑safe context that holds the active configuration instance. Settings can be sourced from environment variables, default definitions, or user‑defined profiles that allow runtime overrides and per‑task customizations. The module also handles deprecation warnings, value callbacks for dependent settings, and utilities for loading, saving, and manipulating profiles.", "business_intent": "Enable centralized, flexible, and safe management of Prefect runtime configuration, supporting environment‑based defaults, profile‑based overrides, and dynamic value handling to ensure consistent behavior across different execution contexts and testing scenarios.", "keywords": ["configuration", "settings", "environment variables", "profiles", "pydantic", "context manager", "async safe", "runtime overrides", "deprecation", "prefect"], "summary_hash": "59a2ccbb62eb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:25:02+00:00"}
