{"summary": "Provides a transpiler pass that adapts a quantum circuit to a device's coupling map by strategically inserting SWAP operations. It explores candidate layouts using a limited-width, depth‑bounded beam search, ranking each potential SWAP by how well the resulting qubit placement enables upcoming two‑qubit gates, and selects the layout that maximizes immediate gate applicability while keeping added SWAPs minimal.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient, hardware‑aware compilation of quantum programs by reducing the number of costly SWAP gates, thereby lowering error rates and execution time on real quantum processors.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit mapping", "SWAP insertion", "beam search", "topology-aware compilation", "Qiskit transpiler", "layout optimization", "gate scheduling", "error mitigation"], "summary_hash": "48361b7889ac", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:47:26+00:00"}
