{"summary": "The module implements a linter for Metaflow flow definitions, providing a collection of validation checks that examine the structure and semantics of a flow's step graph. It verifies properties such as acyclicity, required step attributes, proper use of foreach constructs, static transition rules, naming conventions, and reserved word usage, using helper utilities and decorators to execute the checks.", "business_intent": "To automatically detect and report errors or anti‑patterns in user‑defined Metaflow workflows, ensuring that flows are well‑formed, adhere to platform constraints, and run reliably without runtime failures.", "keywords": ["linting", "flow validation", "Metaflow", "static analysis", "step graph", "acyclicity", "foreach constraints", "parallel steps", "reserved words", "transition checks", "orphan steps", "step naming"], "summary_hash": "58b08ca228ed", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:56:06+00:00"}
