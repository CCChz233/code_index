{"summary": "A command‑line utility that loads a pretrained Imagen text‑to‑image pipeline, generates a collection of images from provided textual prompts, and writes the results to disk for downstream Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) evaluation. Configuration is handled via Hydra and the script can be executed within a PyTorch Lightning Trainer context.", "business_intent": "Provide a reproducible way to assess the visual quality of an Imagen‑based generative model by producing images for FID metric calculation, supporting model benchmarking and validation in production pipelines.", "keywords": ["Imagen", "text-to-image", "image generation", "FID", "evaluation", "Hydra", "PyTorch Lightning", "pipeline", "benchmarking"], "summary_hash": "6632d83db445", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:38:28+00:00"}
