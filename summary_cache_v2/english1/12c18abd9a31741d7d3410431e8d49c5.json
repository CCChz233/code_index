{"summary": "Implements the classic label propagation algorithm on a graph, iteratively updating node label distributions by mixing the normalized adjacency matrix with the original label matrix. Supports configurable steps, weighting between propagated and original labels, various adjacency normalizations, optional clamping of probabilities, post‑propagation row‑normalization, and optional resetting of known labels at each iteration.", "business_intent": "Enables semi‑supervised classification and label inference on graph‑structured data within a deep learning pipeline, allowing users to automatically spread information from a small set of labeled nodes to the rest of the graph.", "keywords": ["label propagation", "semi-supervised learning", "graph neural networks", "adjacency normalization", "alpha weighting", "clamping", "row normalization", "label reset", "DGL", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "e51d80645b9a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:52:23+00:00"}
