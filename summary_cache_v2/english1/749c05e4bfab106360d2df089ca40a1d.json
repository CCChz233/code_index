{"summary": "A pipeline that performs zero‑shot classification of audio signals by leveraging a pre‑trained CLAP model. It accepts raw audio data and a list of textual candidate labels, computes similarity scores between the audio embedding and each label, and returns the most likely labels with confidence scores.", "business_intent": "Allows applications to automatically identify the content of audio clips without needing task‑specific training data, facilitating rapid audio tagging, content moderation, search, and organization in multimedia platforms.", "keywords": ["zero-shot", "audio classification", "CLAP model", "pipeline", "candidate labels", "audio embedding", "inference", "Hugging Face", "multimedia tagging", "content moderation"], "summary_hash": "3b43c90275ed", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:04:39+00:00"}
