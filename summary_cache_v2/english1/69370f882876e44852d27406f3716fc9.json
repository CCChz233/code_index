{"summary": "Provides a suite of unit tests that verify the correct handling of image spacing and orientation metadata during loading with MONAI transforms. The tests cover various configurations—including diagonal, non‑diagonal, and rotated image geometries—by loading synthetic NIfTI files, applying EnsureChannelFirstd, LoadImaged, Spacingd, and Orientationd, and asserting that the resulting tensors match expected shapes, spacings, and orientations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the robustness of the medical imaging preprocessing pipeline by ensuring that spacing and orientation information is accurately interpreted and applied during data loading, which is essential for reliable downstream analysis and model training.", "keywords": ["unit test", "image loading", "spacing", "orientation", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "resampling", "diagonal geometry", "rotated image", "parameterized testing", "numpy", "torch", "nibabel"], "summary_hash": "aee1abd23d6d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:00:11+00:00"}
