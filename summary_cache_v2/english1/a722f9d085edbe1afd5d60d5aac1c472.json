{"summary": "A configuration container that defines all architectural hyper‑parameters for the vision component of a Chinese CLIP model, such as hidden size, number of layers, attention heads, patch and image dimensions, activation, dropout and initialization settings. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and can be passed to the vision model constructor to create a model with the specified structure.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to easily set up and customize the vision transformer backbone for Chinese CLIP applications, facilitating reproducible model creation, fine‑tuning, and deployment with consistent parameter definitions.", "keywords": ["configuration", "vision transformer", "Chinese CLIP", "hyperparameters", "model architecture", "pretrained", "initialization", "dropout", "activation", "patch size", "image size"], "summary_hash": "1551180eeb35", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:54:44+00:00"}
