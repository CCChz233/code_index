{"summary": "A configurable ResNet‑based front‑end that ingests video frames (grayscale or RGB) and produces per‑frame visual feature vectors for lip‑reading systems. It supports multiple ResNet depths, applies spatial average pooling, projects to a desired dimensionality, and can output tensors in either channels‑first or channels‑last layout.", "business_intent": "Supply high‑quality visual speech representations to downstream audio‑visual or visual‑only speech recognition pipelines, improving robustness and accuracy of lip‑reading applications.", "keywords": ["ResNet", "video front‑end", "lip reading", "visual speech recognition", "feature extraction", "spatial pooling", "linear projection", "channels first", "channels last", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "7ea7f40439fa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:48:49+00:00"}
