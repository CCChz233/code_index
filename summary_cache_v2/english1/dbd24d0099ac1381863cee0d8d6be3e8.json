{"summary": "The module contains example command‑line tools that load a trained transducer speech‑recognition model, optionally convert it to a portable format (ONNX or TorchScript), run batched greedy decoding on a collection of audio files, and compute word‑error‑rate and related evaluation metrics.", "business_intent": "Showcase how to export transducer ASR models for deployment and provide a reproducible inference benchmark that helps engineers assess accuracy and performance before integrating the model into production systems.", "keywords": ["speech recognition", "transducer", "ASR", "model export", "ONNX", "TorchScript", "inference", "greedy decoding", "word error rate", "evaluation", "command line", "batch processing"], "summary_hash": "9b7570e5d618", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:57:52+00:00"}
