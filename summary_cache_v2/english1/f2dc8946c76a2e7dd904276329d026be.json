{"summary": "The module provides PyTorch‑based neural network layers that learn low‑dimensional node embeddings from graph structures. It implements random‑walk based algorithms for both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, generating center‑context pairs and training embedding matrices with negative sampling and optional sparse gradients.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to quickly obtain high‑quality node representations for downstream graph analytics such as classification, clustering, recommendation, or link prediction without manually coding random‑walk and embedding optimization logic.", "keywords": ["network embedding", "random walk", "negative sampling", "heterogeneous graph", "node representation learning", "PyTorch", "DGL", "graph analytics", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "b1c32887d6b5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:42:39+00:00"}
