{"summary": "This module contains unit tests that validate the functionality of CZ‑gate based synthesis routines for linear reversible quantum circuits. The tests construct various circuit instances, invoke the synthesis algorithms, and assert that the resulting circuits satisfy properties such as correct depth, connectivity constraints, and equivalence to the target transformations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and performance of quantum circuit synthesis utilities that use CZ gates, supporting reliable development of quantum algorithms and hardware‑aware compilation within the Qiskit ecosystem.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit synthesis", "CZ gate", "linear reversible circuits", "unit testing", "Qiskit", "connectivity verification", "circuit depth", "linear nearest neighbor", "Clifford equivalence", "permutation"], "summary_hash": "a2b76339cc6c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:37:26+00:00"}
