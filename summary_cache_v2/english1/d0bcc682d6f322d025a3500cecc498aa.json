{"summary": "The module supplies a collection of factory utilities for constructing audio‑to‑text datasets used in automatic speech recognition workflows, supporting various tokenization schemes (BPE, character), data loading strategies (tarred files, DALI pipelines, concatenated or code‑switched mixes) and configuration‑driven instantiation. It also defines a prediction writer that manages output files and records ASR inference results per batch.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible, configurable preparation and handling of speech recognition training, validation, and inference data, while providing a standardized mechanism to log and store model predictions within NeMo ASR pipelines.", "keywords": ["automatic speech recognition", "audio-to-text dataset", "BPE tokenization", "character tokenization", "tarred dataset", "DALI integration", "code-switched data", "concatenated dataset", "prediction logging", "NeMo", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "999011b1d997", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:08:28+00:00"}
