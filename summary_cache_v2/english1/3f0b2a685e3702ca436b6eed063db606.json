{"summary": "This test suite validates the manual optimization workflow of a deep‑learning training framework. It defines configurable model stubs that implement custom optimizer configuration, per‑batch training logic, and distributed training handling. The tests cover scenarios such as multiple optimizers, gradient accumulation, automatic mixed precision, learning‑rate scheduler interactions, optimizer closures, and DDP synchronization, ensuring that manual control over optimizer steps behaves as expected.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of user‑controlled optimizer updates in the training library, providing confidence that advanced training patterns (e.g., GANs, custom loss handling, distributed training) function reliably.", "keywords": ["manual optimization", "PyTorch Lightning", "trainer", "optimizer step", "gradient accumulation", "learning rate scheduler", "distributed data parallel", "optimizer closure", "multiple optimizers", "automatic mixed precision", "testing"], "summary_hash": "21d2f41d1489", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:42:32+00:00"}
