{"summary": "The module provides a data structure that models a quantum circuit as a directed acyclic graph, where each wire is represented by edges linking input, output, and operation nodes. The class offers utilities to construct, query, and manipulate the circuit graph, enabling calculations of properties such as depth and width, as well as transformations like register management, sub‑circuit substitution, and operation reordering.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum circuit analysis, optimization, and transformation within Qiskit, facilitating tasks such as depth/width calculation, register handling, sub-circuit substitution, and operation reordering for efficient quantum computation.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "directed acyclic graph", "Qiskit", "circuit analysis", "circuit optimization", "circuit transformation", "depth calculation", "width calculation", "register management", "sub-circuit substitution", "operation reordering"], "summary_hash": "9878b4b65358", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:02:55+00:00"}
