{"summary": "This module adds support for classical‑controlled conditional branching in quantum circuits. It defines a conditional operation that runs one sub‑circuit when a classical condition is true and optionally another when false, and supplies context managers that let users build the true and false branches while automatically handling scope and resource consistency.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum algorithm developers to incorporate if/else logic based on measurement outcomes directly into circuit construction, simplifying the creation of adaptive quantum programs.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "conditional execution", "if-else", "control flow", "context manager", "resource validation", "classical condition", "subcircuit", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "a996d86a20d7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:09:57+00:00"}
