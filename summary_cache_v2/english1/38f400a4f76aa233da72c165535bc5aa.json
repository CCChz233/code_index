{"summary": "A legacy module that implements a collection of low‑level utilities for reading and extracting data from MARC bibliographic records, such as tag lines, subfields, and identifier fields (OCLC, ISBN, LCCN). The code is marked as deprecated in favor of the newer parsing implementation.", "business_intent": "Originally intended to support fast ingestion of MARC records into the Open Library catalog by pulling out key bibliographic metadata (authors, titles, publishers, identifiers). Its purpose now is to serve as a fallback reference while the main parsing logic resides elsewhere.", "keywords": ["MARC", "parsing", "bibliographic metadata", "Open Library", "deprecated", "identifiers", "author extraction", "title extraction", "subfields", "tag lines"], "summary_hash": "1739993429e6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:07:21+00:00"}
