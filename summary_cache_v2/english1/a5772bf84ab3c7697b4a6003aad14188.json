{"summary": "A configuration container that defines all architectural and training hyper‑parameters for the OWL‑ViT vision encoder, such as hidden dimensions, number of transformer layers, attention heads, image and patch resolution, activation function and dropout settings. The object can be passed to the model constructor to create a vision model matching the reference google/owlvit‑base‑patch32 architecture or a custom variant.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to easily configure and instantiate a vision transformer model for image encoding, facilitating integration into computer‑vision pipelines, fine‑tuning, and deployment of OWL‑ViT based solutions.", "keywords": ["vision transformer", "model configuration", "hidden size", "attention heads", "patch size", "image resolution", "activation function", "dropout", "initialization", "pretrained"], "summary_hash": "303f4dc07e02", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:04:39+00:00"}
