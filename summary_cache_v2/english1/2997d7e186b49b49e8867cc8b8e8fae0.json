{"summary": "This module provides a suite of unit tests that verify the functionality of various modeling utilities, including device placement, sharding, offloading, memory balancing, automatic device mapping, checkpoint loading, and tensor type handling across CPUs, GPUs, and meta devices. It defines lightweight model classes and helper functions to facilitate these tests.", "business_intent": "Validate and ensure the correctness of modeling utilities for distributed and efficient model training and deployment, supporting resource optimization and reliable operation across heterogeneous hardware environments.", "keywords": ["unit tests", "modeling utilities", "device placement", "offloading", "sharding", "memory balancing", "auto device map", "checkpoint handling", "tensor type management", "accelerate", "PyTorch", "multi-device", "CPU", "GPU", "meta device"], "summary_hash": "b1e21c1a1e8f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:14:48+00:00"}
