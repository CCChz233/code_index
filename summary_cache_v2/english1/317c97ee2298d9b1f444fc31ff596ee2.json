{"summary": "The script illustrates how to fine‑tune the prior stage of the Wuerstchen text‑to‑image diffusion model using Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It covers argument parsing, dataset loading and preprocessing, caption tokenization, model and LoRA configuration loading, training with the Accelerate library, learning‑rate scheduling, periodic validation image generation, checkpointing, and optional upload to the Hugging Face hub.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run example that enables developers and researchers to efficiently adapt a large text‑to‑image diffusion model to custom data with minimal compute overhead, facilitating rapid prototyping, customized content generation, and deployment of specialized generative AI services.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "diffusion model", "Wuerstchen", "LoRA", "fine-tuning", "accelerate", "dataset preprocessing", "caption tokenization", "validation", "model checkpoint", "Hugging Face hub"], "summary_hash": "ff3f5f88cbb6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:08:40+00:00"}
