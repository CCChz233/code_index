{"summary": "The module provides a tutorial implementation of a deep generative graph model that constructs graphs incrementally by deciding node additions, edge connections, and destination selections. It includes graph embedding and propagation components, action probability calculations, and separate forward paths for training and inference, illustrating the concepts from the DGMG paper.", "business_intent": "Educate users on building and understanding a deep generative model for graphs, offering a reference implementation for research, learning, and prototyping of graph generation techniques.", "keywords": ["graph generation", "deep generative model", "DGMG", "graph neural network", "node addition", "edge addition", "graph embedding", "PyTorch", "DGL", "tutorial"], "summary_hash": "99d834ebd089", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:59:01+00:00"}
