{"summary": "The module implements a downsampling block that applies both max pooling and average pooling to an input tensor, then concatenates the two pooled results along the channel dimension, effectively reducing spatial resolution while doubling channel depth.", "business_intent": "Provide a versatile pooling layer for medical imaging deep learning models that captures complementary information from max and average pooling, improving feature representation for downstream tasks such as segmentation or classification.", "keywords": ["downsampling", "max pooling", "average pooling", "concatenation", "channel expansion", "neural network layer", "MONAI", "PyTorch", "feature extraction", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "e5b70b202ebc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:21:48+00:00"}
