{"summary": "Applies a pixel-wise translation to a batch of tensors, shifting each sample by the provided (dx,dy) offsets while preserving the original shape. The operation supports configurable interpolation (bilinear or nearest) and padding strategies (zeros, border, reflection) and can align corners during sampling.", "business_intent": "Provide a spatial translation transform for image tensors, useful for data augmentation and preprocessing in computer‑vision deep‑learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["translation", "pixel shift", "spatial transform", "interpolation", "bilinear", "nearest", "padding", "zeros", "border", "reflection", "align_corners", "torch", "tensor", "image augmentation", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "e72fe5457336", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:04:59+00:00"}
