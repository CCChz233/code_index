{"summary": "This module implements a specialized diffusion pipeline that extends Stable Diffusion XL with ControlNet and T2I‑Adapter support for spatially guided image generation and inpainting. It orchestrates VAE encoding/decoding, UNet denoising, scheduler handling, safety checking, and integrates multiple adapters to condition the diffusion process on user‑provided masks and control images.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and content creators with a ready‑to‑use pipeline that enables precise, controllable text‑to‑image synthesis and seamless inpainting, facilitating applications such as graphic design, visual effects, and interactive media where users need to edit or guide generated imagery with masks and auxiliary visual cues.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion XL", "ControlNet", "T2I‑Adapter", "inpainting", "text‑to‑image", "diffusion pipeline", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "safety checker", "spatial control", "image generation"], "summary_hash": "2b5daec55048", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:02:05+00:00"}
