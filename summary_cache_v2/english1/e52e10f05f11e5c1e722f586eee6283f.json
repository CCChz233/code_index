{"summary": "A configuration container that holds all architectural hyper‑parameters for a Vision Transformer MSN model, such as hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, feed‑forward size, activation, dropout rates, initialization scale, layer‑norm epsilon, image and patch dimensions, channel count and QKV bias flag. It inherits from the generic pretrained‑config class so it can be passed to the model constructor to build a ViT‑MSN instance with the desired structure.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to easily specify, share and reproduce the exact ViT‑MSN architecture they need for computer‑vision tasks, enabling consistent model creation, fine‑tuning and deployment across projects.", "keywords": ["ViT", "MSN", "configuration", "hyperparameters", "vision transformer", "model architecture", "pretrained config", "dropout", "layer normalization", "patch size", "image size", "attention heads"], "summary_hash": "e264331c46b5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:00:18+00:00"}
