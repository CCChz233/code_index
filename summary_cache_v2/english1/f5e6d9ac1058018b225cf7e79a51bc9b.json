{"summary": "The module implements the logic for evaluating whether individuals who develop symptoms will present to a health facility for a generic first appointment. It calculates a baseline probability of care‑seeking for an average symptom, modifies this probability according to symptom‑specific effects using a linear model, and integrates the decision process into the simulation lifecycle through initialization, population setup, birth events, and daily polling.", "business_intent": "To realistically model health‑seeking behavior within a population health simulation, thereby influencing healthcare utilization patterns and downstream health outcomes based on symptom profiles and demographic factors.", "keywords": ["health seeking behavior", "symptom onset", "care seeking probability", "population health simulation", "event-driven modeling", "generic first appointment", "healthcare utilization", "linear model", "parameterization", "demographic modeling"], "summary_hash": "aeef1fd8d216", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:47:22+00:00"}
