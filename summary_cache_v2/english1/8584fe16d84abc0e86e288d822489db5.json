{"summary": "Implements algorithms to automatically generate quantum circuits that prepare stabilizer states from a set of stabilizer generators. The approach builds an intermediate graph state, decomposes it into layers of Clifford gates, and includes options to optimize for linear nearest‑neighbor connectivity and circuit depth.", "business_intent": "Enables quantum software developers and compiler tools to efficiently construct and optimize stabilizer‑state preparation circuits, facilitating integration of stabilizer synthesis into larger quantum workflows and hardware‑aware circuit compilation.", "keywords": ["stabilizer state synthesis", "Clifford circuit", "graph state construction", "circuit decomposition", "linear nearest neighbor optimization", "depth reduction", "quantum compilation", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "02ae6414a113", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:04:10+00:00"}
