{"summary": "A toolbox of low‑level geometric utilities that apply transformations such as flipping, rotating, scaling, affine and perspective warps, padding, grid distortion, and thin‑plate‑spline warping to images, masks, bounding boxes, and keypoints. It also provides matrix creation, padding calculations, validation, and helper routines needed by higher‑level augmentation pipelines.", "business_intent": "To enrich computer‑vision training data by programmatically altering the geometry of images and their annotations, thereby improving model robustness and generalization.", "keywords": ["geometric transformation", "affine warp", "perspective warp", "flip", "rotate", "scale", "padding", "grid distortion", "thin plate spline", "image augmentation", "mask augmentation", "bounding box transformation", "keypoint transformation", "computer vision", "data augmentation"], "summary_hash": "bd3aa56b90f3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:29:13+00:00"}
