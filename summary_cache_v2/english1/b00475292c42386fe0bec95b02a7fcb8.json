{"summary": "A neural‑network layer that downsamples 1‑dimensional temporal tensors by sliding a window across the sequence and outputting the maximum value within each window. The window size, stride, padding mode, and channel ordering are configurable, allowing the layer to reduce sequence length while preserving the most prominent activations.", "business_intent": "Enable deep‑learning models to efficiently compress sequential data, improve computational performance, and increase translation invariance by extracting dominant features from time‑series or signal inputs.", "keywords": ["max pooling", "1D", "downsampling", "temporal data", "stride", "padding", "neural network layer", "Keras", "feature extraction", "dimensionality reduction"], "summary_hash": "1b095d199c43", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:02:26+00:00"}
