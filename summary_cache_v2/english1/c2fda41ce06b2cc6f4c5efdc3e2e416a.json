{"summary": "A comprehensive unit‑test module that validates Django's OGR geometry objects. It exercises creation, type detection, and serialization to WKT, WKB, GML, JSON and HEX, checks spatial predicates (contains, intersects, touches, within, overlaps, disjoint, crosses), performs topological operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference), verifies handling of 2D/3D coordinates, coordinate‑system transformations, empty geometries and object pickling.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness, stability and GIS‑standard compliance of OGR geometry handling in Django applications, preventing regressions and ensuring reliable spatial operations across different formats and dimensionalities.", "keywords": ["OGR", "geometry", "GIS", "Django", "unit tests", "WKT", "WKB", "GML", "JSON", "HEX", "spatial predicates", "topological operations", "CRS transformation", "2D", "3D", "empty geometry", "pickling"], "summary_hash": "a4d12c48a2e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:19:43+00:00"}
