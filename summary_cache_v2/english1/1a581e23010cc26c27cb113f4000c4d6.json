{"summary": "Implements a variational autoencoder specialized for video data, encoding video tensors into a compact latent space with KL regularization and reconstructing videos from those latents. The architecture features configurable 3‑D down‑sampling and up‑sampling blocks, temporal compression, and a scaling factor that normalizes latent variance for diffusion models. It includes optional float‑32 upcasting for numerical stability, memory‑efficient tiling and slicing, and gradient checkpointing support.", "business_intent": "Provide an efficient latent‑space representation of videos for downstream generative pipelines, such as diffusion models, enabling high‑resolution video synthesis with reduced computational cost and seamless integration into the Allegro video generation framework.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "KL regularization", "video encoding", "latent representation", "diffusion models", "3D downsampling", "3D upsampling", "temporal compression", "scaling factor", "float32 upcasting", "tiling", "slicing", "gradient checkpointing", "high‑resolution video", "Allegro"], "summary_hash": "02845229e6d2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:29:45+00:00"}
