{"summary": "A proof-of-concept module that defines a hierarchical task planning system. It models individual tasks and their relationships, builds a dependency graph, and determines a deterministic execution order using topological sorting. The system executes tasks asynchronously via OpenAI function calls, ensuring parent-child dependencies are respected and duplicate runs are avoided.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate how to orchestrate complex, dependency-driven workflows with AI function calls, enabling automated planning and execution of multi-step processes in a reliable, ordered manner for AI-powered automation solutions.", "keywords": ["task planning", "topological sort", "dependency graph", "asynchronous execution", "OpenAI functions", "hierarchical tasks", "workflow automation", "Pydantic models"], "summary_hash": "998b73a07fee", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:43:03+00:00"}
