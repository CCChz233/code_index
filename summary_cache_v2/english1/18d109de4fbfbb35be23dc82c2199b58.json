{"summary": "The module implements tools for synthetic charged-particle radiography, centered on a class that simulates a proton radiography experiment. It generates particles from a source, interpolates user-provided electric and magnetic field grids, integrates particle trajectories using a Boris pusher, optionally accounts for wire-mesh effects, and aggregates the particle distribution on a detector plane to produce a synthetic radiograph. The file also contains unused helper functions.", "business_intent": "Provide scientists and engineers with a computational framework to generate and analyze synthetic proton radiographs, supporting field reconstruction and plasma diagnostic studies.", "keywords": ["synthetic radiography", "charged particle", "proton radiography", "field propagation", "particle trajectory", "Boris pusher", "electric field", "magnetic field", "detector plane", "plasma diagnostics", "simulation", "grid interpolation"], "summary_hash": "38348c2f77b6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:16:44+00:00"}
