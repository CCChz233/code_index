{"summary": "Provides PinSAGE‑style neighbor sampling utilities for DGL, including CPU and GPU samplers that generate homogeneous subgraphs from heterogeneous bipartite or multi‑type graphs. The samplers run multiple random walks following a configurable metapath, count node visitation frequencies, select the most frequently visited same‑type nodes as neighbors, and construct a graph where edge attributes store these visit counts. A small helper selects top‑k neighbors based on visitation statistics.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, scalable construction of training mini‑batches for graph neural network recommender models (e.g., PinSAGE) on large heterogeneous graphs by offering efficient, type‑aware random‑walk based neighbor sampling with optional GPU acceleration.", "keywords": ["PinSAGE", "neighbor sampling", "random walks", "metapath", "heterogeneous graph", "GPU sampling", "graph neural networks", "recommender systems", "DGL", "edge weights"], "summary_hash": "e6a645832858", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:37:53+00:00"}
