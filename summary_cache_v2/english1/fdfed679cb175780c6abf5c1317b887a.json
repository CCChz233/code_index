{"summary": "The module provides a suite of command‑line tools and utilities for working with the NeVA multimodal language model within the NVIDIA NeMo ecosystem. It includes functionality to convert HuggingFace LLaVA checkpoints into NeVA .nemo files, pre‑train the model from scratch, fine‑tune it (including parameter‑efficient PEFT), and evaluate its performance on custom request datasets. All operations leverage the Megatron‑based training framework, Hydra configuration management, and distributed GPU execution.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and engineers to efficiently develop, adapt, and assess multimodal language models by offering end‑to‑end pipelines for model conversion, large‑scale pre‑training, fine‑tuning (standard and PEFT), and evaluation, thereby accelerating AI product development and experimentation.", "keywords": ["multimodal", "language model", "NeVA", "NeMo", "Megatron", "pretraining", "fine-tuning", "PEFT", "evaluation", "model conversion", "distributed training", "Hydra", "GPU", "checkpoint", "inference"], "summary_hash": "9d1778531017", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:56:21+00:00"}
