{"summary": "Implements a generic transpiler pass that gathers blocks of nodes from a circuit DAG using a configurable collection routine and then merges each block using a configurable collapsing routine, producing an updated DAG. It works with both DAGCircuit and DAGDependency representations and serves as a base class for specialized passes that fix the collection and collapse functions.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, modular mechanism for quantum circuit optimization that separates block collection from block consolidation, allowing developers to plug in specific strategies and apply them uniformly across different DAG representations during transpilation.", "keywords": ["transpiler", "quantum circuit", "DAG", "block collection", "block collapse", "optimization", "modular", "generic pass", "commutativity analysis", "subclassable"], "summary_hash": "68d2e9a2f1db", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:42:43+00:00"}
