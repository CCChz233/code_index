{"summary": "The module provides an inpainting pipeline based on the Stable Diffusion 3 architecture. It integrates frozen text encoders, a conditional transformer, a diffusion scheduler, and a variational auto‑encoder to process a masked input image and a textual prompt, generate latent representations for the missing regions, iteratively denoise them with classifier‑free guidance, and decode the result into a completed image.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and end‑users to edit or restore images by automatically filling masked areas according to natural‑language instructions, supporting use cases such as creative retouching, content creation, visual prototyping, and image restoration.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "inpainting", "image editing", "diffusion pipeline", "latent diffusion", "mask handling", "text guidance", "classifier-free guidance", "variational auto-encoder", "CLIP", "T5", "torch"], "summary_hash": "a8f82554768b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:42:10+00:00"}
