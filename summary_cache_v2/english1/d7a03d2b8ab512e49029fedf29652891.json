{"summary": "Implements a transpiler pass that examines a scheduled quantum circuit for idle intervals (delays) and inserts a configurable sequence of gates that together act as the identity, mitigating decoherence while preserving the circuit's logical behavior and global phase. Supports single‑gate sequences when the inverse can be absorbed into adjacent operations (e.g., Hahn echo) and allows custom qubit selection and pulse spacing.", "business_intent": "Automatically improve the physical fidelity of quantum programs by adding dynamical decoupling pulses during idle periods, reducing error rates without altering the intended computation.", "keywords": ["dynamical decoupling", "quantum circuit transpilation", "idle period mitigation", "identity gate sequence", "decoherence reduction", "Hahn echo", "global phase preservation", "scheduled circuit", "instruction durations", "error mitigation"], "summary_hash": "50b8d074b631", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:48:19+00:00"}
