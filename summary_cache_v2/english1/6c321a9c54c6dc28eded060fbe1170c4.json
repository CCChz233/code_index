{"summary": "Provides a layer that selects a subset of node indices according to a specified pooling ratio, serving the VIPool graph pooling operation. It holds configuration parameters (pool ratio, hidden dimension, activation) and applies the selection logic in its forward pass.", "business_intent": "Allow configurable reduction of graph nodes during pooling, preserving a desired percentage of nodes to improve efficiency and performance of downstream graph neural network tasks.", "keywords": ["index selection", "graph pooling", "VIPool", "pooling ratio", "node reduction", "activation function", "hidden dimension", "layer", "forward pass"], "summary_hash": "8cff7be26386", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:13:25+00:00"}
