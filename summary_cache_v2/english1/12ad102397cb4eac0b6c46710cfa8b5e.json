{"summary": "Implements a text‑guided image‑to‑image generation workflow using the Alt Diffusion model. The module orchestrates loading and preprocessing of the source image, encoding textual prompts, preparing latent representations, executing the diffusion process with classifier‑free guidance, decoding the resulting latents back to pixel space, and applying safety filters to the final output.", "business_intent": "Provides a ready‑to‑use solution for creators, marketers, and designers to transform or enhance existing images based on natural language descriptions, enabling rapid visual content creation and customization powered by AI diffusion techniques.", "keywords": ["image-to-image", "text-guided diffusion", "latent preparation", "prompt encoding", "safety checking", "AI image generation", "Alt Diffusion", "preprocessing", "decoder", "creative AI"], "summary_hash": "e69cf9160b17", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:43:44+00:00"}
