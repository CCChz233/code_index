{"summary": "The module implements a Flask‑based server that combines several Faiss‑backed retrieval services into a single HTTP API. It exposes endpoints for querying nearest‑neighbor tokens, adding new document chunks, modifying index weights, resetting the index, and persisting the index state, delegating the underlying operations to dynamic or static Faiss retrieval services.", "business_intent": "To provide a flexible, scalable retrieval layer for NLP models that can be queried and updated over the network, supporting real‑time search, incremental indexing, and weight tuning for downstream applications such as question answering or language model grounding.", "keywords": ["Flask", "Faiss", "vector retrieval", "API", "nearest neighbor", "index management", "dynamic indexing", "NLP", "Megatron", "document chunk addition", "index persistence"], "summary_hash": "a791d186fcf6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:26:19+00:00"}
