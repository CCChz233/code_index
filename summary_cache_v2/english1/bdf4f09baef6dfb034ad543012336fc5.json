{"summary": "A suite of protocol‑specific attack implementations for the NTLM relay framework, each encapsulating the logic to exploit relayed authentication over services such as SMB, LDAP, HTTP, IMAP, MSSQL, RPC and DCSYNC. The modules handle credential harvesting, command execution, object creation and privilege escalation, with optional proxy/SOCKS support.", "business_intent": "Enable security professionals to demonstrate the impact of NTLM relay vulnerabilities by automatically extracting credentials, creating privileged directory objects, and gaining remote command execution on target systems, thereby facilitating penetration testing and red‑team assessments.", "keywords": ["NTLM relay", "credential harvesting", "SMB attack", "LDAP attack", "HTTP exploitation", "IMAP credential search", "MSSQL remote shell", "RPC payload", "DCSYNC hash extraction", "proxy support", "domain takeover", "privilege escalation"], "summary_hash": "5cb4ae6a10a8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:24:40+00:00"}
