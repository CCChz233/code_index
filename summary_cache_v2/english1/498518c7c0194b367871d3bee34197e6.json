{"summary": "A configuration container that encapsulates all architectural and training hyperparameters required to build a Fuyu causal language model, including token vocabulary, transformer dimensions, attention heads, activation functions, positional encoding settings, image patching parameters, dropout rates, RoPE scaling options, and embedding tying flags. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration base and is used to instantiate a fully specified Fuyu model.", "business_intent": "Provides a flexible way for developers and enterprises to tailor Fuyu multimodal language models to specific product needs—such as chat assistants, content generation, or vision‑language applications—by adjusting model size, performance characteristics, and specialized features without modifying source code.", "keywords": ["configuration", "transformer", "causal language model", "multimodal", "vision-language", "hyperparameters", "RoPE scaling", "attention heads", "dropout", "embedding tying", "pretrained model"], "summary_hash": "c0b3899b8154", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:51:23+00:00"}
