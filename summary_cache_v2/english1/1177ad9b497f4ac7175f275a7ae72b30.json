{"summary": "Implements a scenario class that performs a maximum‑sensitivity analysis for an active noise cancellation (ANC) system within the TLO simulation environment. The class configures required modules, records configuration details, visualises parameter combinations, and drives the analysis execution.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and engineers to evaluate how variations in ANC system parameters influence performance, supporting optimisation, robustness assessment, and informed design decisions.", "keywords": ["active noise cancellation", "maximum sensitivity analysis", "simulation scenario", "parameter visualisation", "configuration logging", "TLO framework", "health system modelling"], "summary_hash": "884dc4deaf1d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:06:13+00:00"}
