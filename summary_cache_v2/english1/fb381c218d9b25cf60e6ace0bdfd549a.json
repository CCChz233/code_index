{"summary": "We need to infer summary, business intent, keywords based on file-level metadata and function summaries. The file is Demos/benchmarks/meteor_contest.py. Likely a benchmark script for a puzzle/meteor contest. Functions: convert, flip, get_footprints, get_puzzle, get_senh, main, permute, print_board, rotate, solve.
