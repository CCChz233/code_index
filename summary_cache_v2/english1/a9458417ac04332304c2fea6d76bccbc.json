{"summary": "Provides internal utilities for translating NumPy‑style slicing and indexing expressions into Dask block‑level operations. It normalizes indices, expands ellipsis and new axes, computes block slices, and builds slicing plans that are used to construct high‑level graphs for lazy getitem and setitem on distributed arrays.", "business_intent": "Allow Dask arrays to support full NumPy indexing semantics (including slices, integer/boolean arrays, ellipsis, and new axes) while preserving lazy, parallel execution across chunks.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "slicing", "indexing", "block indexing", "lazy evaluation", "high‑level graph", "getitem", "setitem", "boolean indexing", "integer indexing", "ellipsis handling", "normalization"], "summary_hash": "34849f4e4ee5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:18:19+00:00"}
