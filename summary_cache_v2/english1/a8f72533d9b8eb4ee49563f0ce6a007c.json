{"summary": "A set of command‑line tools that build synthetic code‑switching speech corpora from existing monolingual audio manifests. First, they generate an intermediate manifest describing how segments from two languages should be combined, then they synthesize the mixed‑language audio files, apply configurable pauses and amplitude scaling, and output a final manifest suitable for training automatic speech recognition and language‑identification models.", "business_intent": "Provide an automated pipeline for rapidly creating large, high‑quality code‑switching speech datasets, enabling companies and researchers to train multilingual ASR and LID systems without costly manual data collection.", "keywords": ["code-switching", "synthetic speech dataset", "ASR training", "language identification", "manifest generation", "audio synthesis", "multilingual", "data augmentation", "NeMo", "speech recognition"], "summary_hash": "bbd487de915d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:14:40+00:00"}
