{"summary": "This module implements geometric utilities for calculating intersections on spherical grids. It provides low‑level routines to find where great‑circle arcs intersect each other or constant latitude/longitude lines, to evaluate face bounds, and to count intersection occurrences across the grid.", "business_intent": "Enable precise spatial queries on geophysical grid data, such as clipping grids to a region, extracting sub‑domains, or analyzing grid topology by determining where grid edges cross specified latitude or longitude boundaries.", "keywords": ["intersection", "great circle", "spherical geometry", "latitude", "longitude", "grid", "arc", "mesh", "geospatial", "uxarray", "boundary detection"], "summary_hash": "5f8af1ac6627", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:27:46+00:00"}
