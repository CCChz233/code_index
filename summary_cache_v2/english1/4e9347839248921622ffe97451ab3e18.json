{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with keys: summary, business_intent, keywords (list). Must not list method names verbatim. Focus on class responsibility and state/behavior. Provide English.\n\nWe have class ClvpEncoderConfig: configuration class for CLVP encoder (text or speech). Stores hyperparameters: vocab size, hidden size, intermediate size, projection dim, number of layers, attention heads, activation, layer norm epsilon, dropout rates, rotary embedding flag, attention bias flag, summary pooling type, initializer factor, BOS/EOS token ids. Inherits from PretrainedConfig. Used to instantiate encoder with given arguments; defaults match susnato/clvp_dev model.\n\nSo summary: configuration container for CLVP encoder, defines architecture hyperparameters and token IDs, controls model initialization and output behavior.\n\nBusiness intent: Provide a flexible way for developers to configure and instantiate CLVP encoder models for text or speech tasks, enabling reproducible setups and customization of model size, attention, pooling, etc., within the Transformers ecosystem.\n\nKeywords: configuration, CLIP-like voice processing (CLVP), encoder, transformer, hyperparameters, vocab size, hidden size, attention heads, dropout, rotary embedding, pooling strategy, token IDs, pretrained model.\n\nMake sure not to list method names.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed to start with {{ and end with }}?
