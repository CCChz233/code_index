{"summary": "The module defines engine classes that manage the full lifecycle of Stable Diffusion text‑to‑image models, including data encoding/decoding, optimizer configuration, EMA handling, logging, and sample generation. It supports both a standard diffusion engine and a Megatron‑based engine for large‑scale distributed training.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to efficiently train and deploy high‑quality text‑to‑image generative models at scale, leveraging NVIDIA NeMo's infrastructure and Megatron parallelism for enterprise‑grade AI applications.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "stable diffusion", "text-to-image", "training engine", "Megatron", "distributed training", "EMA", "optimizer", "logging", "sample generation", "NeMo", "generative AI", "model parallelism", "multimodal"], "summary_hash": "c0083847a6f7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:06:33+00:00"}
