{"summary": "The module defines specialized client‑side data types that wrap Arkouda’s high‑performance integer arrays. One type treats each integer as a fixed‑width binary vector with optional bit‑order reversal, another maps integer bits to named flag fields and provides string conversion, and a third interprets 64‑bit integers as IPv4 addresses with dotted‑quad formatting. Supporting utilities create bit‑vector instances and detect IP address versions.", "business_intent": "Provide Arkouda users with convenient, efficient representations for binary flag collections and IP address data, allowing large‑scale analytics to manipulate these values numerically while still presenting human‑readable forms.", "keywords": ["bit vector", "binary flags", "integer array wrapper", "IPv4 address", "high‑performance data type", "Arkouda", "numeric computation", "string representation", "IP detection"], "summary_hash": "9b489e3edd9b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:23:41+00:00"}
