{"summary": "This module defines several lightweight utility classes (A, B, C, CClassBase, CClassSub, D, E, F, G, I, K) and a few helper functions, primarily for testing and demonstrating various Python features such as class methods, static methods, generators, super calls, closures, and callable chains. The classes provide simple helper methods that return constant values, expose attribute names, handle inheritance, raise specific errors, and return callables that can be invoked to retrieve class names or other identifiers. The functions serve as simple test helpers.", "business_intent": "The module serves as a test suite for verifying Python language features and behaviors, such as inheritance, super calls, method resolution, and callable objects, ensuring that these constructs work correctly in different scenarios.", "keywords": ["testing", "Python language features", "inheritance", "super", "callable", "closures", "generators", "class methods", "static methods"], "summary_hash": "49471407cdb5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:23:40+00:00"}
