{"summary": "The module defines a neural network layer that implements a global attention mechanism for transformer models. It computes attention scores over the entire input sequence, optionally applying causal or global token patterns, and integrates with the xformers attention framework with support for optional sparsification.", "business_intent": "Offer an efficient way for models to capture long-range dependencies and aggregate information from the entire sequence, improving performance on tasks requiring global context such as document classification, summarization, or language modeling.", "keywords": ["global attention", "transformer", "sequence aggregation", "scaled dot-product", "sparsity", "attention patterns", "causal", "token", "xformers", "neural network layer"], "summary_hash": "2e03507a3f60", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:34:48+00:00"}
