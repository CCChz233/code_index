{"summary": "This module provides utilities for creating animated visualizations of single-qubit state transitions under quantum gates. It includes a dynamic namespace class for storing attributes, a quaternion class for handling rotations on the Bloch sphere, and helper functions to initialize and run the animation. The module is not currently integrated into the rest of the library.", "business_intent": "Enable users to visualize and understand how quantum gates affect a single qubit's state over time, facilitating education, debugging, and presentation of quantum algorithms.", "keywords": ["visualization", "animation", "quantum state transition", "Bloch sphere", "single qubit", "quaternion", "gate", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "27f4471953d6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:02:35+00:00"}
