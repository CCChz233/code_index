{"summary": "The module offers a tutorial implementation of a Line Graph Neural Network using DGL and PyTorch. It defines core GNN components that operate on the line graph derived from a citation dataset, includes data loading, preprocessing, and simple utilities for batching, sparse conversion, and visualization, focusing on conceptual clarity rather than performance.", "business_intent": "Educate users on building and training a line‑graph based graph neural network, demonstrating graph transformations, message‑passing mechanisms, and model construction for research or learning purposes.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "line graph", "DGL", "PyTorch", "tutorial", "citation graph", "message passing", "node representation", "edge representation", "visualization"], "summary_hash": "10c905c18361", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:58:57+00:00"}
