{"summary": "A configuration container for the PoolFormer vision model that holds all architectural hyperparameters—input channels, patch size and stride, pooling window, MLP ratio, encoder block depths, hidden dimensions, per‑stage patch sizes, strides, padding, number of encoder blocks, dropout rate, activation function, and layer‑scale settings. It inherits from PretrainedConfig and is used to instantiate a PoolFormerModel with the specified architecture.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to define, customize, and reproduce specific PoolFormer model variants for image processing tasks, simplifying model creation, sharing, and reproducibility within the Transformers ecosystem.", "keywords": ["configuration", "model architecture", "vision model", "PoolFormer", "image processing", "patch embedding", "pooling", "MLP ratio", "encoder blocks", "dropout", "activation", "layer scaling", "pretrained config"], "summary_hash": "15b550105b9f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:13:20+00:00"}
