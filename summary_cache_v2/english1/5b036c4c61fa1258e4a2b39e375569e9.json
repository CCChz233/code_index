{"summary": "The module defines a simple class with a custom textual representation and provides a collection of minimal test functions that exercise Cython's handling of Python builtin types (int, dict, object) as well as the custom class. These helpers are used in the test suite to verify correct type conversion and string representation behavior.", "business_intent": "Validate that Cython correctly interacts with Python builtin types and custom class representations within the test framework, ensuring reliable type handling and output formatting.", "keywords": ["Cython", "builtin types", "int", "dict", "object", "custom class", "repr", "test suite", "type conversion", "cdef class"], "summary_hash": "59517dd37135", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:22:35+00:00"}
