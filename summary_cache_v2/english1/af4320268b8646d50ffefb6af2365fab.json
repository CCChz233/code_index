{"summary": "The module provides an example workflow for training textual inversion embeddings on the Stable Diffusion XL model. It defines a dataset that yields prompts and token data, sets up an accelerator‑based training loop with diffusion schedulers, optimizers, and validation logging, and includes utilities for checkpointing, saving model cards, and uploading results to the HuggingFace hub.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and artists to create custom token embeddings that can be used with SDXL to personalize text‑to‑image generation, and to share those embeddings easily through model cards on the HuggingFace platform.", "keywords": ["textual inversion", "SDXL", "diffusion training", "custom embeddings", "dataset", "accelerator", "checkpointing", "model card", "HuggingFace", "CLIP tokenizer"], "summary_hash": "c5213b4a0d14", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:58:09+00:00"}
