{"summary": "This module provides the core workflow for hyperparameter optimization of 3D medical image segmentation algorithms in MONAI Auto3Dseg. It orchestrates training and algorithm generation cycles, creates and saves necessary scripts, configuration files, and state pickles, and supplies adapters that integrate the generated algorithms with external HPO platforms such as NNI and Optuna.", "business_intent": "Automate the tuning of segmentation model hyperparameters to achieve higher accuracy while ensuring reproducible, deployable algorithm bundles, and simplify integration with popular HPO services for scalable experimentation.", "keywords": ["hyperparameter optimization", "3D segmentation", "MONAI", "Auto3Dseg", "NNI", "Optuna", "algorithm generation", "model training", "artifact persistence", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "f95d5f95149e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:25:13+00:00"}
