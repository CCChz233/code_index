{"summary": "The module implements a Qiskit transpiler transformation pass that scans a quantum circuit, identifies contiguous blocks of gates that act on the same set of qubits, and replaces each block with a single Unitary node representing the combined operation. It leverages utilities for collecting one‑qubit runs and two‑qubit blocks, computes the corresponding unitary matrices, and integrates the new nodes back into the DAG representation, preparing the circuit for subsequent synthesis or optimization stages.", "business_intent": "To reduce circuit depth and gate count by collapsing sequential operations into compact unitary representations, thereby improving compilation efficiency and enabling further optimization passes in quantum software workflows.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "transpiler", "gate consolidation", "unitary synthesis", "optimization", "Qiskit", "transformation pass", "circuit simplification", "block merging", "quantum compilation"], "summary_hash": "728115b0f6e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:25:34+00:00"}
