{"summary": "Implements the EdgeConv operation from Dynamic Graph CNN, a graph neural network layer that computes edge messages as a linear transformation of the difference between neighbor and central node features combined with a linear transformation of the central node itself, aggregates messages with a max operation, optionally applies batch normalization, and provides configurable handling of zero‑in‑degree nodes.", "business_intent": "Enable deep learning models to extract local geometric features from point clouds or graph-structured data by performing edge‑based convolution and aggregation, facilitating tasks such as classification, segmentation, and representation learning on irregular domains.", "keywords": ["edge convolution", "graph neural network", "dynamic graph CNN", "neighbor aggregation", "max pooling", "batch normalization", "zero in-degree handling", "point cloud processing", "message passing", "linear transformation"], "summary_hash": "152bfd455d0b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:56:39+00:00"}
