{"summary": "The lazy transform package implements the infrastructure for deferred execution of image preprocessing operations in MONAI. It defines placeholder and dictionary markers that trigger evaluation of pending transforms, utilities for logging, combining metadata, and performing resampling with proper affine handling, as well as core data structures for affine matrices and dense displacement fields. The module manages pending operations, validates shapes, composes transforms, and ensures correct interpolation during lazy execution.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient and flexible medical imaging pipelines by postponing costly resampling and other transformations until necessary, reducing redundant computation and memory usage while preserving accurate spatial information.", "keywords": ["lazy evaluation", "deferred transforms", "resampling", "affine matrix", "displacement field", "MONAI", "medical imaging preprocessing", "pipeline optimization", "interpolation handling", "pending operations"], "summary_hash": "1d21053c55ca", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:30:21+00:00"}
