{"summary": "Implements an Euler-based discrete scheduler for diffusion models, handling the construction of the noise schedule, timestep scaling, and input scaling during sampling. It offers configurable sigma generation methods (linear, Karras, exponential, beta), interpolation types, prediction modes, step offsets, and beta rescaling to adapt the denoising trajectory for diverse generative tasks.", "business_intent": "Supply a flexible, high‑performance scheduler component that drives the denoising steps in diffusion‑based generative AI pipelines, allowing developers to fine‑tune sampling dynamics for improved image and video generation quality.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "Euler scheduler", "noise schedule", "beta schedule", "sigma computation", "timestep scaling", "interpolation", "prediction type", "generative AI", "sampling"], "summary_hash": "5b42029659e7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:59:24+00:00"}
