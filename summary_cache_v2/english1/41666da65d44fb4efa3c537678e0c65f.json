{"summary": "The package provides a complete PinSAGE recommendation pipeline built on DGL and PyTorch. It includes utilities for converting raw interaction tables into heterogeneous graphs, preparing training/validation splits, sampling sub‑graphs, defining graph‑based neural layers (including GraphSAGE and weighted convolutions), implementing dense and sparse PinSAGE models, and evaluating recommendation quality.", "business_intent": "To enable developers and data scientists to construct, train, and evaluate graph‑neural‑network based recommender systems for platforms such as streaming services or e‑commerce sites, improving personalized item ranking using user‑item interaction graphs.", "keywords": ["PinSAGE", "graph neural network", "recommendation system", "DGL", "PyTorch", "graph construction", "sampling", "sparse training", "evaluation", "item embeddings", "MovieLens", "Nowplaying"], "summary_hash": "cb59e8112a94", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:53:11+00:00"}
