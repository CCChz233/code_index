{"summary": "The module defines a collection of neural network components for graph processing using DGL and PyTorch. It includes a fully connected layer with configurable activation, a discriminator for distinguishing local versus random graph neighborhoods, a graph convolution followed by dropout, pooling and unpooling layers for hierarchical graph reduction and expansion, and a selection layer that extracts node subsets based on a pooling ratio.", "business_intent": "Supply reusable building blocks that enable developers to construct and train graph neural network models, supporting tasks such as representation learning, hierarchical graph pooling, and adversarial discrimination of node neighborhoods.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "PyTorch", "DGL", "graph convolution", "pooling", "unpooling", "discriminator", "dense layer", "dropout", "node selection", "hierarchical graph"], "summary_hash": "d0cf74e9d951", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:18:36+00:00"}
