{"summary": "This module defines utilities for creating dynamically generated subclasses that enable partial, incremental validation of Pydantic models as JSON data is received in streams. It provides a base helper class with methods to extract JSON fragments, handle both synchronous and asynchronous streaming responses, and construct model instances from incremental data chunks.", "business_intent": "Allow applications to process large or streaming JSON payloads efficiently by validating and constructing model objects piece‑by‑piece, reducing latency and memory consumption for APIs and data pipelines that receive data incrementally.", "keywords": ["partial validation", "dynamic subclass", "streaming JSON", "incremental parsing", "synchronous", "asynchronous", "Pydantic", "model generation", "data chunks", "JSON extraction"], "summary_hash": "b553e20de9fc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:34:34+00:00"}
