{"summary": "The module defines a suite of PyTorch adapter components for diffusion models, including full‑size, lightweight, and XL variants, as well as building‑block residual units and composite multi‑adapter structures. These adapters transform intermediate feature maps, optionally downsample them, and integrate additional conditioning information into the main UNet pipeline.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to easily incorporate and combine conditioning adapters into text‑to‑image diffusion models, facilitating fine‑tuning, modular architecture design, and efficient inference while maintaining flexibility across model scales.", "keywords": ["adapter", "residual block", "downsampling", "diffusion model", "text-to-image", "feature transformation", "lightweight", "multi‑adapter", "PyTorch", "modular architecture"], "summary_hash": "4363bdb7e774", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:15:53+00:00"}
