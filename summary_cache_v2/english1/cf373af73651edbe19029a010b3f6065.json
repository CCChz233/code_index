{"summary": "The module defines a GateSequence abstraction that stores an ordered list of quantum gates together with the cumulative unitary they implement. It supplies algebraic helpers for handling SU(2) and SO(3) representations, Euler‑angle calculations, and conversion utilities, and enables transformation of the sequence into Qiskit circuit or DAG objects.", "business_intent": "To support quantum circuit synthesis workflows by providing a convenient, mathematically‑aware container for gate sequences that tracks their overall unitary and can be readily turned into executable circuit structures.", "keywords": ["quantum gate sequence", "unitary matrix", "gate composition", "circuit conversion", "SU(2)", "SO(3)", "Euler angles", "quantum synthesis", "discrete basis", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "0baeaa427365", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:58:30+00:00"}
