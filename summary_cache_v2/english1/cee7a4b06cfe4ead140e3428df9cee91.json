{"summary": "The module provides a collection of adapter components and strategies for augmenting multi‑head attention layers in transformer‑based speech recognition models. It includes mechanisms for residual addition of adapter outputs, absolute and relative positional encodings, and a configurable attention block that supports feature projection, dropout, and adapter composition.", "business_intent": "Enable parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning and customization of transformer encoders in ASR systems by supplying plug‑in adapters for attention and positional encoding, facilitating rapid model adaptation to new domains or languages while preserving the core architecture.", "keywords": ["multi-head attention", "adapter", "residual connection", "positional encoding", "relative positional encoding", "Transformer-XL", "speech recognition", "ASR", "modular", "dropout", "feature projection"], "summary_hash": "02935a624d7c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:17:18+00:00"}
