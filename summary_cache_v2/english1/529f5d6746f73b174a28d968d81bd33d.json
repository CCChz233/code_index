{"summary": "A configuration container for the Idefics model that encapsulates architectural hyper‑parameters, especially those governing an optional Perceiver‑style resampler (latent count, depth, heads, head dimension, and layer‑norm usage). It inherits from a generic pretrained‑model config, allowing seamless model instantiation with custom settings.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers a flexible way to define and adjust the Idefics model’s structure—particularly the resampling component—so they can instantiate models that match specific performance, memory, or task requirements without modifying source code.", "keywords": ["configuration", "Idefics", "perceiver", "resampler", "model architecture", "hyperparameters", "pretrained config", "transformer", "cross attention", "latent embeddings"], "summary_hash": "0caba4dc671f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:42:29+00:00"}
