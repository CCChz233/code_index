{"summary": "A wrapper that loads a HuggingFace IterableDataset containing audio and transcript fields, transforms each entry into the format expected by NeMo ASR models, and applies optional preprocessing such as channel selection, audio augmentation, silence trimming, RMS normalization, text normalization, and token ID insertion. It supports distributed shuffling, sample‑id retrieval, and provides iterator and length interfaces along with internal sample construction and collation utilities.", "business_intent": "Facilitate seamless integration of external HuggingFace audio‑text datasets into NeMo training pipelines for automatic speech recognition, reducing data‑handling effort and ensuring consistent preprocessing across distributed training.", "keywords": ["HuggingFace", "IterableDataset", "audio", "transcript", "ASR", "NeMo", "preprocessing", "augmentation", "normalization", "tokenization", "distributed shuffling", "collate"], "summary_hash": "26e7684ab1c2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:38:53+00:00"}
