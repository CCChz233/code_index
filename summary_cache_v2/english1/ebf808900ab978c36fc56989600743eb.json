{"summary": "This module implements a set of utilities for padding CuPy arrays. It includes low‑level helpers for calculating edge indices, linear ramps, and setting padded regions, as well as a high‑level pad function that can apply various padding modes (e.g., constant, reflect, wrap) to extend arrays along specified axes.", "business_intent": "Enable GPU‑accelerated array padding operations needed for scientific computing, image processing, and convolutional algorithms within the CuPy library.", "keywords": ["padding", "CuPy", "GPU", "array", "reflect", "wrap", "edge handling", "convolution", "image processing"], "summary_hash": "f3c6d8e8b286", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:20:33+00:00"}
