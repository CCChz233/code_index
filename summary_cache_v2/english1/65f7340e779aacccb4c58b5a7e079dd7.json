{"summary": "The module sets up and runs an evaluation pipeline for a Megatron retrieval‑augmented language model. It parses a Hydra configuration, loads a request dataset, initializes the MegatronRetrievalModel with generation settings (length and sampling), configures distributed training strategies, and executes the evaluation using a PyTorch Lightning trainer.", "business_intent": "Provide a reproducible benchmark for assessing the quality and efficiency of large retrieval‑based language models in research or production environments.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "RETRO", "language model evaluation", "retrieval‑augmented generation", "Hydra configuration", "PyTorch Lightning", "distributed training", "sampling parameters", "length constraints", "benchmarking"], "summary_hash": "0c2755953726", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:43:13+00:00"}
