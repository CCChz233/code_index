{"summary": "This package supplies the core abstractions and utilities that underpin Django's GIS database backends. It offers a geometry-to-WKT adapter, a feature‑detection base for assessing spatial capabilities of a backend, a mixin that standardises spatial reference system model behavior, and a generic operations class that handles geometry processing, extents, distance handling, SQL placeholder creation, and SRID management.", "business_intent": "To provide a reusable, engine‑agnostic foundation that enables Django applications to store, query, and manipulate geographic data across various spatial databases, simplifying backend implementation and ensuring consistent GIS functionality.", "keywords": ["Django", "GIS", "spatial database", "geometry conversion", "WKT", "backend capabilities", "spatial reference system", "operations", "distance calculation", "extent", "SQL generation", "abstraction"], "summary_hash": "edee7ea3203f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:34:01+00:00"}
