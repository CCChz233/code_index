{"summary": "Implements a feature‑matching loss that compares the intermediate activations of discriminator networks for real and synthesized audio, averaging the absolute differences across all discriminators and layers and normalising by their count.", "business_intent": "Supplies a training objective for audio GANs that encourages the generator to produce outputs whose internal discriminator representations match those of real audio, enhancing realism and training stability.", "keywords": ["feature matching", "loss function", "discriminator activations", "audio generation", "GAN", "leaky ReLU", "layer-wise comparison", "normalisation", "training stability", "generative model"], "summary_hash": "c01d313d726e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:43:05+00:00"}
