{"summary": "A suite of utilities for preparing NVIDIA NeMo language model checkpoints for TensorRT‑LLM inference. It includes tools to load and manipulate model parameters across devices, split and transpose weights, apply int8 quantization, extract and adapt model metadata and tokenizer assets, and convert the checkpoint directory into the proprietary TensorRT‑LLM format, supporting both single‑node and distributed setups.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless migration of NeMo LLM models to TensorRT‑LLM, allowing high‑performance inference deployment with optimized weight handling and tokenizer compatibility.", "keywords": ["NeMo", "TensorRT-LLM", "checkpoint conversion", "weight processing", "int8 quantization", "tokenizer", "SentencePiece", "model serialization", "device‑agnostic loading", "distributed inference"], "summary_hash": "bd97497e9e57", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:12:09+00:00"}
