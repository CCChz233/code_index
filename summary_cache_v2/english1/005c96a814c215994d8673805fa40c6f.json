{"summary": "This module provides unit tests that validate utility functions for handling Zarr metadata and dataset scaling. The tests exercise the function that builds a dictionary mapping table names to their Zarr paths and the function that rescales dataset values, ensuring they operate correctly within the fractal tasks core utilities.", "business_intent": "Guarantee reliable processing of Zarr attribute information and correct rescaling of dataset values in data analysis pipelines, preventing errors in downstream tasks that rely on these utilities.", "keywords": ["unit test", "Zarr", "metadata", "table path dictionary", "rescale datasets", "fractal tasks core", "utility functions", "data processing", "debugging"], "summary_hash": "c8fb879a44fc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:55:40+00:00"}
