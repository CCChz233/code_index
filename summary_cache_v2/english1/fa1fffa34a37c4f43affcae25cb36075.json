{"summary": "This module implements the TensorRT-LLM backend for the Optimum Benchmark suite, providing configuration handling, model class resolution, temporary engine directory management, and execution of inference for supported large language model types. It also defines a dataclass that stores, validates, and normalizes all configuration options required to run TensorRT-accelerated models within the benchmarking framework.", "business_intent": "Enable users to benchmark and evaluate the performance of TensorRT-accelerated large language models in a standardized, reproducible manner, facilitating performance comparison and optimization within the Optimum ecosystem.", "keywords": ["TensorRT-LLM", "Optimum Benchmark", "backend", "configuration", "large language model", "inference", "performance evaluation", "engine management", "dataclass", "validation"], "summary_hash": "f8b890d77a1f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:32:58+00:00"}
