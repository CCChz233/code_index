{"summary": "The script loads a pre‑trained Text‑to‑SPARQL neural translation model using a Hydra configuration, runs it on a designated test set, and reports evaluation metrics such as accuracy or BLEU scores. It allows configuration overrides via command‑line arguments and integrates with NeMo logging and PyTorch Lightning for reproducible assessment.", "business_intent": "Provide a quick, configurable way to validate the quality of a Text‑to‑SPARQL model before deployment, ensuring that natural‑language queries are correctly transformed into SPARQL statements for downstream knowledge‑graph applications.", "keywords": ["evaluation", "text2sparql", "neural machine translation", "model checkpoint", "test dataset", "NeMo", "Hydra config", "PyTorch Lightning", "metrics"], "summary_hash": "8538865c2e49", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:45:32+00:00"}
