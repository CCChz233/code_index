{"summary": "Encapsulates the logic for determining whether an individual experiencing symptoms will present at a health facility for a generic first appointment. It computes a base probability of care‑seeking for an average symptom and adjusts it based on symptom‑specific effects, integrating this decision process into the simulation lifecycle (initialization, population setup, birth events, and parameter loading).", "business_intent": "To model and predict individual health‑seeking behavior in response to symptom onset, supporting simulation of healthcare demand and evaluation of health system interventions.", "keywords": ["health seeking behavior", "symptom onset", "probability model", "healthcare utilization", "simulation", "generic first appointment", "linear models", "population initialization", "prediction"], "summary_hash": "2a7ebf1e6ba2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:11:54+00:00"}
