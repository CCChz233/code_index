{"summary": "The module implements a fallback mechanism for CuPy, automatically delegating calls that lack CuPy implementations to the equivalent NumPy functions. It provides a proxy class that intercepts attribute access and method calls, conversion helpers between CuPy, NumPy, and the fallback representation, and wrapper types that mimic CuPy's ndarray and vectorize interfaces while transparently using NumPy when necessary.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless execution of code written for CuPy on systems without full GPU support by automatically falling back to NumPy, thereby improving portability, reducing conditional code, and preserving functionality across diverse environments.", "keywords": ["fallback", "CuPy", "NumPy", "proxy", "attribute resolution", "ndarray wrapper", "vectorize", "compatibility", "GPU acceleration", "automatic delegation"], "summary_hash": "8765b43e5622", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:31:47+00:00"}
