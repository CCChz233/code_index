{"summary": "The module implements automated test suites for the StableVideoDiffusionPipeline, offering fast unit tests that validate core functionality, data handling, and performance optimizations, alongside slower integration tests that execute full video generation on GPU to confirm end‑to‑end correctness. It also provides a small utility to convert tensors to NumPy arrays.", "business_intent": "To ensure the stability, correctness, and performance of the stable video diffusion model across code changes, providing confidence for downstream applications that rely on high‑quality video generation.", "keywords": ["stable video diffusion", "pipeline testing", "unit tests", "integration tests", "video generation", "diffusion model", "performance optimization", "GPU", "torch", "deterministic", "validation"], "summary_hash": "89895855a9a9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:48:17+00:00"}
