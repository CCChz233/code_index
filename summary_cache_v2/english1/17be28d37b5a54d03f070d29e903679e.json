{"summary": "Implements a two‑qubit controlled‑U gate that applies a generic single‑qubit rotation (θ, φ, λ) with an optional global phase γ to the target qubit when the control qubit is in the |1⟩ state, exposing its matrix form and integration with Qiskit circuits.", "business_intent": "Provides a modular, parameterised quantum gate for building and simulating quantum algorithms, allowing developers to incorporate controlled rotations with phase control into larger quantum circuits.", "keywords": ["controlled-U", "two-qubit gate", "quantum circuit", "parameterised rotation", "global phase", "Qiskit", "gate matrix", "quantum algorithm"], "summary_hash": "9ffc2cc36416", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:31:38+00:00"}
