{"summary": "The module defines a GLUE benchmark model class that orchestrates configuration‑driven data handling, specifies neural input and output types, implements the forward computation, and provides training, validation, and multi‑validation step logic. It also includes utilities for enumerating and selecting different GLUE model variants.", "business_intent": "Enable users to fine‑tune and evaluate NLP models on the GLUE benchmark within the NeMo framework, offering a streamlined interface for loading task data, computing losses, and reporting metrics across multiple GLUE tasks.", "keywords": ["GLUE", "benchmark", "NLP", "sequence classification", "sequence regression", "model training", "validation", "multi‑validation", "configuration", "data loading", "metrics", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning"], "summary_hash": "b473d0905995", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:34:19+00:00"}
