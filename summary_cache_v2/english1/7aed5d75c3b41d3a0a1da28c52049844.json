{"summary": "The module defines a command‑line example that prepares a text classification dataset, tokenizes it, creates data loaders, initializes a transformer model with an optimizer and learning‑rate scheduler, and runs a training loop while leveraging Accelerate's profiling utilities to capture performance metrics across distributed or single‑GPU setups.", "business_intent": "Show developers how to integrate Accelerate's profiling tools into a typical PyTorch/Transformers training workflow to monitor and optimize computational efficiency, especially in distributed environments.", "keywords": ["profiling", "accelerate", "distributed training", "transformers", "pytorch", "data loading", "tokenization", "training loop", "performance analysis", "GPU utilization"], "summary_hash": "f40d28550b8d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:16:50+00:00"}
