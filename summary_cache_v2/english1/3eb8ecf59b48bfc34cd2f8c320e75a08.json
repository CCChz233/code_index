{"summary": "The module implements a nearest‑neighbour based intent recogniser for conversational AI. It encodes user utterances and intent label descriptions with a pretrained transformer model, aggregates token embeddings via mean pooling, and selects the intent whose embedding has the highest cosine similarity to the utterance embedding. Integrated with NeMo data processors and datasets, it manages data preparation, training, validation, and testing workflows, and reports classification and dialogue generation metrics.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, low‑resource intent classification for dialogue agents, allowing conversational platforms to map user inputs to predefined intents without extensive model fine‑tuning.", "keywords": ["intent recognition", "nearest neighbour", "dialogue systems", "embedding", "cosine similarity", "mean pooling", "transformer", "NeMo", "training pipeline", "validation", "testing", "classification metrics"], "summary_hash": "7ddc212cf6f4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:37:47+00:00"}
