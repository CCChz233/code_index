{"summary": "The script sets up a CIFAR‑10 data module and a Lightning model wrapper, runs a training and validation loop under the PyTorch Profiler, and saves separate trace files for the training_step and validation_step. It also provides instructions for visualizing the generated traces using Chrome’s tracing UI or the TensorBoard Profiler.", "business_intent": "Showcase how to profile deep‑learning workloads with PyTorch Lightning, enabling developers to measure and optimise the performance of training and validation phases.", "keywords": ["PyTorch Lightning", "profiling", "CIFAR-10", "data module", "model wrapper", "training step", "validation step", "Chrome tracing", "TensorBoard", "PyTorch Profiler", "CLI", "performance analysis"], "summary_hash": "6815094e3e68", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:49:17+00:00"}
