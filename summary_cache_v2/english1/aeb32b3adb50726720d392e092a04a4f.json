{"summary": "Applies a random coarse dropout augmentation to a set of dictionary entries, ensuring all specified keys share the same spatial shape and receive identical dropout masks. The transform wraps MONAI's RandCoarseDropout, allowing configuration of number and size of holes, fill values, probability, and handling of missing keys.", "business_intent": "To augment medical imaging datasets by randomly masking out coarse regions in a coordinated way across related images (e.g., multi‑modal scans), thereby increasing model robustness to missing or corrupted tissue information.", "keywords": ["random coarse dropout", "dictionary transform", "multi-key consistency", "medical imaging augmentation", "spatial mask", "hole generation", "fill value", "probability", "missing key handling", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "d26393e65b6f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:55:20+00:00"}
