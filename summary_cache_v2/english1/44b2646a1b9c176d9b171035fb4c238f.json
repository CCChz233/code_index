{"summary": "Provides integration test suites that exercise the software’s end‑to‑end functionality. One suite loads application definitions from YAML, constructs command‑line calls, runs the programs, and checks generated outputs against reference data. Another suite validates the ray‑tracing engine, including curve integration, image creation, ray data handling, and specific telescope mirror configurations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the optical simulation and ray‑tracing applications behave correctly in real usage scenarios, supporting quality assurance and continuous delivery for scientific and engineering workflows.", "keywords": ["integration testing", "configuration parsing", "YAML", "command line execution", "output validation", "reference comparison", "ray tracing", "optical simulation", "telescope models", "curve integration", "image generation", "temporary files"], "summary_hash": "573e9fe62bac", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:56:10+00:00"}
