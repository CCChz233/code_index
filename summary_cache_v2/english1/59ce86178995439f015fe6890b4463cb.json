{"summary": "The module defines a unified interface and concrete implementations for reading whole‑slide pathology images using different back‑ends (cuCIM, OpenSlide, TiffFile). It abstracts file format handling, supports extracting image patches at specified resolutions, magnifications or pyramid levels, and offers options for channel ordering, data‑type conversion, device placement, color mode, and parallel loading.", "business_intent": "To provide a flexible, high‑performance way to load and preprocess large whole‑slide images for medical imaging AI workflows, enabling downstream deep‑learning models to efficiently access image patches at the required scale and format.", "keywords": ["whole-slide image", "WSI", "patch extraction", "cuCIM", "OpenSlide", "TiffFile", "medical imaging", "pathology", "image reader", "MONAI", "resolution", "magnification", "channel ordering", "dtype conversion", "device placement", "parallel loading"], "summary_hash": "6d0c0df786a4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:11:59+00:00"}
