{"summary": "Defines a scenario class that configures a series of simulation runs to compare baseline health system performance with scaled‑up disease‑specific programmes (HIV, TB, malaria and a combined package). It sets a common scale‑up start date, retains default health‑system settings, and supplies utilities for generating parameter sets, logging configuration details and accessing related model modules.", "business_intent": "To assess the health impact and resource implications of expanding individual or combined disease control programmes, enabling policymakers and analysts to evaluate horizontal versus vertical program strategies.", "keywords": ["scenario", "simulation", "scale‑up", "HIV", "TB", "malaria", "health programme", "baseline", "parameter generation", "health system", "policy analysis", "horizontal vs vertical"], "summary_hash": "116516b05bf0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:52:46+00:00"}
