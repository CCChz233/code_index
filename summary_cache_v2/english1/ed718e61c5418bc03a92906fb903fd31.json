{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that generates images using a consistency‑model approach. The pipeline prepares latent tensors, optionally incorporates class labels, runs an iterative denoising loop with a UNet denoiser and a stochastic scheduler, and decodes the final latents into image outputs.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and creators to produce high‑quality synthetic images quickly for use in media, advertising, design, and AI‑generated content workflows.", "keywords": ["image synthesis", "consistency model", "diffusion pipeline", "UNet denoiser", "iterative denoising", "latent generation", "class‑conditional", "unconditional", "PyTorch", "AI art"], "summary_hash": "77c1ba2c0e12", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:19:46+00:00"}
