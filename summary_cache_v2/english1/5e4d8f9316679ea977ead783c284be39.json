{"summary": "Defines a Delay instruction class used in quantum circuits to represent a timed idle operation. The class encapsulates duration handling, parameter validation, matrix representation, inversion behavior, and conditional execution support.", "business_intent": "Enable users to insert precise timing pauses into quantum programs, facilitating hardware scheduling, coherence management, and compatibility with backends that implement delay primitives.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "delay", "idle", "duration", "parameterized", "gate", "instruction", "Qiskit", "matrix", "validation", "conditional"], "summary_hash": "b8c00e414782", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:52:43+00:00"}
