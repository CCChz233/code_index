{"summary": "This module implements a diffusion pipeline that combines Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, and PAG techniques to perform image inpainting. The pipeline orchestrates model loading, input preprocessing (including images, masks, and textual prompts), control signal integration, latent manipulation, and safety checking to generate edited images guided by user-provided conditions.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to leverage advanced AI-driven inpainting for image editing, restoration, and creative generation, offering fine‑grained control through prompts and auxiliary models while ensuring safe output.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "controlnet", "inpainting", "image generation", "prompt guidance", "mask processing", "latent diffusion", "safety checker", "torch", "pipeline"], "summary_hash": "acaad4da53e3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:16:35+00:00"}
