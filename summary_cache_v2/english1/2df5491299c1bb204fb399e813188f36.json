{"summary": "The module parses Cairo type declarations, converting them into internal data‑type objects such as structs, arrays, tuples, and felt types. It resolves struct references, handles inline type definitions, and raises a specific error for unknown types, serving as the core type‑interpretation layer for StarkNet contract tooling.", "business_intent": "To provide a reliable Python utility that translates Cairo type specifications into usable representations, enabling contract developers and tooling to validate, generate, and interact with StarkNet contracts accurately.", "keywords": ["Cairo", "type parsing", "struct resolution", "array type", "tuple type", "Felt", "StarkNet", "contract ABI", "type conversion", "parser", "internal representation"], "summary_hash": "0aac3ea3fcb9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:45:08+00:00"}
