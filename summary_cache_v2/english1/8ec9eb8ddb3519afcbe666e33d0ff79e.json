{"summary": "A unit‑test suite that validates TensorFlow logits processors and warpers used to shape token probability distributions during text generation, covering forced token insertion, start/end token enforcement, length constraints, bad‑word filtering, n‑gram repetition avoidance, penalty application, token suppression, and sampling temperature/top‑k/top‑p strategies.", "business_intent": "Guarantee reliable and controllable language model output by testing that each logits manipulation component behaves as expected, supporting safe and customizable text generation in production systems.", "keywords": ["TensorFlow", "logits processor", "logits warper", "unit test", "forced token", "BOS", "EOS", "minimum length", "bad word filter", "no repeat n‑gram", "repetition penalty", "token suppression", "temperature scaling", "top‑k sampling", "top‑p sampling", "text generation"], "summary_hash": "2d06926b5093", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:24:14+00:00"}
