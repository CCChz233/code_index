{"summary": "This module implements an integration with the Langsmith observability service. It defines a logger that gathers LLM request and response data, resolves authentication credentials, formats the information according to Langsmith's schema, batches events, and transmits them via HTTP (supporting both synchronous and asynchronous modes). A small utility checks if objects are JSON‑serializable.", "business_intent": "Provide Litellm users with automatic telemetry collection and delivery to Langsmith, enabling monitoring, debugging, and analysis of LLM usage for better observability and compliance.", "keywords": ["Langsmith", "logging", "observability", "LLM", "batching", "HTTP", "asynchronous", "credential management", "payload serialization", "integration"], "summary_hash": "a79d9ecfce96", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:40:57+00:00"}
