{"summary": "A command‑line training script that fine‑tunes a Stable Diffusion text‑to‑image prior model using parameter‑efficient LoRA adapters. It loads and preprocesses datasets, tokenizes captions, sets up the diffusion scheduler and LoRA attention processors, runs the training loop with Accelerate, handles checkpointing and optional model‑card creation, and supports optional integration with Hugging Face Hub.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use tool for developers and researchers to adapt Stable Diffusion models to specific domains or styles with minimal additional parameters, enabling customized text‑to‑image generation for commercial or creative applications.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion", "text-to-image", "LoRA", "fine-tuning", "diffusion model", "prior transformer", "accelerate", "dataset preprocessing", "model checkpoint", "Hugging Face Hub"], "summary_hash": "e2eed7cf6ddd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:08:45+00:00"}
