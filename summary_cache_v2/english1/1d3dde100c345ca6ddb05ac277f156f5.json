{"summary": "This module implements a configurable variational autoencoder with KL regularization and a dedicated temporal decoder, enabling encoding of image sequences into compact latent spaces and reconstruction from those latents using customizable channel dimensions, block structures, scaling, and optional high‑precision upcasting for large‑resolution pipelines.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, high‑performance VAE component for diffusion‑based generative pipelines that handle temporal data such as video, allowing efficient latent encoding/decoding with regularization and scalability to high‑resolution scenarios.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "KL divergence", "temporal decoder", "latent representation", "diffusion models", "high-resolution upcasting", "configurable architecture", "PyTorch", "3D UNet blocks", "attention processors"], "summary_hash": "5c01beb456e3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:29:48+00:00"}
