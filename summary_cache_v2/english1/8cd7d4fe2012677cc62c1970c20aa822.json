{"summary": "The class orchestrates the full lifecycle of a PyTorch (or HuggingFace) model, managing training, evaluation, and inference. It prepares data, wraps the model for parallelism, creates optimizers and schedulers, runs the training loop with checkpointing, logging, callbacks, and supports mixed‑precision and hyper‑parameter search. It also handles model saving, loading, and publishing to the HuggingFace hub.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to fine‑tune transformer models quickly and reliably with minimal code, while providing robust support for distributed training, experiment tracking, and deployment workflows.", "keywords": ["training loop", "evaluation", "prediction", "PyTorch", "Transformers", "optimizer", "scheduler", "checkpointing", "callbacks", "distributed training", "mixed precision", "hyperparameter search", "model saving", "hub integration", "data collator", "tokenizer"], "summary_hash": "af0bb376a0ad", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:24:00+00:00"}
