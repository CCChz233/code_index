{"summary": "The launchers package supplies a framework for configuring and executing external benchmark commands with robust handling of hardware isolation, NUMA binding, temporary resources, and logging. It includes a configuration object that validates launch parameters based on detected NVIDIA or ROCm hardware and user preferences, and utilities that discover processes occupying AMD or NVIDIA devices, enforce isolation, and manage related signals during benchmark runs.", "business_intent": "To provide a reliable, reproducible way to run performance benchmarks on systems with multiple GPUs, ensuring that benchmarks run in isolated environments without interference from other processes, thereby delivering accurate measurement and simplifying benchmark orchestration for developers and researchers.", "keywords": ["benchmark launcher", "device isolation", "GPU", "NVIDIA", "ROCm", "NUMA binding", "configuration dataclass", "process management", "temporary files", "logging", "hardware detection"], "summary_hash": "55650c1b469f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:32:40+00:00"}
