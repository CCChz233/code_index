{"summary": "The package includes two modules that showcase Prefect flow definition and import patterns in a nested project. One module defines a flow that coordinates actions by calling helper utilities from shared libraries using explicit relative imports, while the other provides a stub function that imports the same utilities via implicit relative imports without executing any logic.", "business_intent": "To serve as test fixtures that verify correct handling of explicit and implicit relative imports and Prefect flow orchestration within a nested project structure.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "flow", "relative import", "explicit import", "implicit import", "nested project", "testing", "shared utilities", "stub"], "summary_hash": "7edd9adde0c9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:57:50+00:00"}
