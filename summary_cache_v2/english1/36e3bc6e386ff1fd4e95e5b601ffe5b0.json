{"summary": "A dataset wrapper that uses a memory‑mapped binary file together with an index to expose both whole‑document and fixed‑size chunk views of the underlying data. It can operate in a standard mode or a retrieval mode where each document is extended with padded tokens, enabling efficient random access for training and retrieval‑augmented workflows.", "business_intent": "Provide fast, low‑memory access to massive text corpora for language model training and retrieval‑augmented generation, allowing downstream systems to fetch documents or their constituent chunks on demand without loading the entire dataset into RAM.", "keywords": ["memory‑mapped", "indexed dataset", "chunk access", "document access", "retrieval augmentation", "padded tokens", "efficient I/O", "large‑scale training data"], "summary_hash": "90231df51ec4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:00:27+00:00"}
