{"summary": "The module supplies benchmark utilities for evaluating the execution performance of Prefect tasks and flows. It includes helper routines that invoke tasks via direct call, decorator usage, and asynchronous submission, as well as a routine to run a flow, and a trivial no‑operation function used as a benchmark baseline.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to measure and compare the speed of different Prefect task invocation patterns and flow execution, supporting performance testing and optimization during development.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "task", "flow", "benchmark", "performance", "pytest-benchmark", "execution speed", "no‑op"], "summary_hash": "dae442af2609", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:07:59+00:00"}
