{"summary": "A dataset class that streams audio files stored in tar archives, reads a JSON manifest for each sample, applies optional trimming, normalization, windowing, and duration filtering, and converts label strings into multi‑label tensors for tasks such as speaker recognition or voice activity detection. It supports configurable shuffle buffering, shard distribution strategies, and distributed‑training partitioning to ensure balanced data loading across multiple workers.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, memory‑efficient data pipeline for training deep learning models on large, tarred audio collections with multi‑label annotations, especially in distributed or multi‑process environments.", "keywords": ["tarred audio", "multi‑label classification", "manifest", "WebDataset", "sharding", "distributed training", "audio preprocessing", "duration filtering", "normalization", "windowing", "speaker recognition", "voice activity detection"], "summary_hash": "29159c079b0a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:17:54+00:00"}
