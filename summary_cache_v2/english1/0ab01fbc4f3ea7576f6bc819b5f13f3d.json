{"summary": "The script is a reference implementation for training a Text‑to‑Image adapter model on top of Stable Diffusion XL. It sets up argument parsing, prepares a training dataset, preprocesses images and prompts, computes text embeddings, configures the diffusion scheduler and optimizer, runs a distributed training loop with Accelerate, periodically validates the model by generating sample images, and saves checkpoints and model cards to the Hugging Face Hub.", "business_intent": "To provide developers with a ready‑to‑use example that enables them to fine‑tune custom adapters for SDXL, allowing integration of specialized visual styles or concepts into text‑to‑image generation pipelines for commercial or research applications.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "text-to-image", "adapter training", "accelerate", "diffusers", "PyTorch", "dataset preprocessing", "model checkpointing", "validation generation", "Hugging Face Hub", "SDXL", "T2IAdapter"], "summary_hash": "feeb0074124c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:58:04+00:00"}
