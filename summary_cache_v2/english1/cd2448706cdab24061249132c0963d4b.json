{"summary": "Implements a metric that computes the F‑1 score—the harmonic mean of precision and recall—for binary, multi‑class, or multi‑label classification tasks. It allows optional thresholding of predictions and supports various averaging modes (none, micro, macro, weighted) to return either per‑class scores or a single aggregated value.", "business_intent": "Enables model developers to quantitatively evaluate classification performance during training and validation, particularly in scenarios with imbalanced classes, by providing a reliable, configurable metric that can be logged, monitored, or used for model selection.", "keywords": ["F1 score", "precision", "recall", "harmonic mean", "classification metric", "multi‑class", "multi‑label", "averaging", "micro", "macro", "weighted", "thresholding", "model evaluation", "keras"], "summary_hash": "8d82abaaae65", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:45:35+00:00"}
