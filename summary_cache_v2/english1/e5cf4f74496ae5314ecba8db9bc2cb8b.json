{"summary": "Implements a pipeline that runs the prior model of the Kandinsky system, converting textual inputs into latent representations for the subsequent image decoder. It manages model initialization, reconstruction from configuration data, and loading of pretrained weights.", "business_intent": "Offer a plug‑and‑play component that generates prior embeddings for Kandinsky, enabling developers to incorporate text‑to‑image generation capabilities into their applications.", "keywords": ["Kandinsky", "prior pipeline", "latent generation", "text-to-image", "model loading", "configuration", "pretrained weights", "AI art", "diffusion model"], "summary_hash": "4bf9c7cb77ed", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:48:25+00:00"}
