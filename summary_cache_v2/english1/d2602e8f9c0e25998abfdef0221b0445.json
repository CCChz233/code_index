{"summary": "The module implements a training pipeline for multi‑token textual inversion, providing a dataset class to load image‑text pairs, utilities for token handling, and integration with diffusion models (Stable Diffusion) using Accelerate for distributed training and optional logging. It orchestrates model loading, optimizer setup, checkpointing, and progress saving to enable learning custom token embeddings that can be used with CLIP‑based text encoders.", "business_intent": "Allow users to create personalized token embeddings for text‑to‑image diffusion models, enhancing the ability to generate customized visual content based on novel concepts or brand assets.", "keywords": ["textual inversion", "multi‑token embeddings", "stable diffusion", "diffusion training", "custom token", "dataset", "tokenizer", "accelerate", "checkpoint", "wandb", "huggingface"], "summary_hash": "6ea08ea78f1b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:06:06+00:00"}
