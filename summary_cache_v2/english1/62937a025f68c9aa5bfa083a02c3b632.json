{"summary": "The module creates Advanced SubStation Alpha (ASS) subtitle files that visually highlight speech alignment results. It can produce subtitles where either individual tokens or whole words are highlighted in sync with their alignment timings, using segment boundaries to group text that appears simultaneously. Helper utilities handle character counting, time formatting, color conversion, and utterance resegmentation.", "business_intent": "Enable users such as linguists, developers, or media producers to generate synchronized subtitle files that illustrate forced‑alignment data, facilitating review, debugging, and presentation of speech-to-text alignment in video or audio content.", "keywords": ["ASS subtitle generation", "forced alignment visualization", "token-level highlighting", "word-level highlighting", "segment boundaries", "timing conversion", "color formatting", "speech analysis tools"], "summary_hash": "970b63cb0907", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:25:03+00:00"}
