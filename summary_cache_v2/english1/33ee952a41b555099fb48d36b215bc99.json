{"summary": "A straightforward brute‑force implementation of the N‑Queens puzzle that enumerates all possible queen placements using permutation generation and validates each configuration for diagonal conflicts. The module offers a command‑line interface to run the solver, measure execution time, and includes a basic self‑test.", "business_intent": "Serve as a reference and benchmark for evaluating the performance of simple combinatorial algorithms, particularly to compare pure Python execution with compiled alternatives such as Cython, and to illustrate algorithmic concepts for educational or profiling purposes.", "keywords": ["n‑queens", "brute force", "permutation", "benchmark", "performance", "algorithm", "chess puzzle", "backtracking", "profiling", "command line"], "summary_hash": "a73283d6599b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:20:41+00:00"}
