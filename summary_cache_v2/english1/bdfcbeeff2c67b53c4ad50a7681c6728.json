{"summary": "A configuration container for the XLM-Roberta-XL transformer model that holds all architectural hyperparameters such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, dropout rates, position‑embedding type, and initialization settings. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate or modify a XLMRobertaXLModel (or its TensorFlow counterpart) with a reproducible setup.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to easily define, customize, and share the architecture settings of a multilingual XLM‑Roberta‑XL model, facilitating model creation, fine‑tuning, and deployment for natural language processing tasks.", "keywords": ["XLM-Roberta-XL", "configuration", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "vocabulary size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "dropout", "position embeddings", "pretrained model", "multilingual NLP"], "summary_hash": "3a3554e063a5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:25:43+00:00"}
