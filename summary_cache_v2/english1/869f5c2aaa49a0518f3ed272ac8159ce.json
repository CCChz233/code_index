{"summary": "A wrapper that isolates the non‑FP16‑compatible parts of a vector quantizer, allowing it to be used within PyTorch’s automatic mixed‑precision training. It holds a quantizer module that outputs the quantized tensor, associated loss, and index‑based representation, and provides utility functions for embedding inputs, running forward passes, and performing the quantization step.", "business_intent": "Facilitate stable mixed‑precision training of models that incorporate vector quantization by separating precision‑sensitive operations, thereby simplifying integration and reducing numerical issues.", "keywords": ["vector quantization", "mixed precision training", "AMP", "FP16 isolation", "PyTorch", "quantizer module", "embedding utilities", "loss computation", "index representation"], "summary_hash": "63cfa92d6b7e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:16:04+00:00"}
