{"summary": "A comprehensive pytest suite for the NeMo automatic speech recognition (ASR) collection, exercising model architectures (CTC, RNNT, hybrid, classification, regression, diarization, multi‑task, confidence ensembles), data handling (datasets, tokenizers, preprocessing, simulation, sampling), core audio processing components, training utilities, decoding strategies, export to ONNX, and evaluation metrics (WER, DER, confidence). The tests validate construction, configuration, forward passes, loss computation, decoding, checkpointing, and integration of optional optimizations such as Numba and stochastic depth.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness, stability, and performance of NeMo's speech‑recognition pipelines before release, reducing regression risk and supporting high‑quality ASR products for customers.", "keywords": ["ASR", "unit testing", "speech recognition", "CTC", "RNNT", "hybrid model", "diarization", "context biasing", "tokenizer", "BPE", "character tokenization", "dataset loading", "preprocessing", "audio simulation", "feature extraction", "filterbank", "subsampling", "confidence ensemble", "export", "ONNX", "metrics", "WER", "DER", "stochastic depth", "Numba", "PyTorch", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "bfb20db4cb69", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:53:53+00:00"}
