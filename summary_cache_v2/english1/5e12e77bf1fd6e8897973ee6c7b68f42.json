{"summary": "Implements a neural network layer that approximates large 2‑D convolution kernels by applying consecutive 1‑D convolutions (K×1 followed by 1×K). This design provides a wide receptive field while keeping parameter count and computational load low, and includes a straightforward forward computation.", "business_intent": "Provides an efficient building block for high‑resolution image analysis such as semantic segmentation, object detection, or medical imaging, where capturing global context with large kernels is critical but computational resources are limited.", "keywords": ["global convolution", "separable convolution", "large kernel", "2D kernel approximation", "deep learning", "computer vision", "efficient convolution", "receptive field"], "summary_hash": "5fbe247a0f9b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:50:10+00:00"}
