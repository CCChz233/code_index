{"summary": "Implements a 2‑D batch‑normalization layer with fixed running statistics and affine parameters, adding a small epsilon before the square‑root to avoid NaNs. The layer normalizes inputs using stored values without updating them during training, ensuring stable feature scaling.", "business_intent": "Supply a non‑learnable, numerically stable normalization component for computer‑vision models such as Deformable DETR, enabling consistent inference and training when batch statistics must remain unchanged.", "keywords": ["batch normalization", "frozen parameters", "fixed statistics", "epsilon stability", "Deformable DETR", "computer vision", "PyTorch", "inference stability", "feature scaling"], "summary_hash": "e551472b981e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:09:43+00:00"}
