{"summary": "The module provides a complete example of training a Deep Q‑Network on the CartPole environment using PyTorch Lightning. It defines an agent that interacts with Gym, a replay buffer with random minibatch sampling, a simple multilayer perceptron Q‑network, an iterable dataset that streams experiences, and a Lightning module that manages the primary and target networks, loss computation, optimizer, and training step.", "business_intent": "Showcase a ready‑to‑run template for building and scaling reinforcement‑learning solutions with Lightning, helping developers quickly prototype DQN agents, integrate with TensorBoard for monitoring, and reuse the components for other RL tasks.", "keywords": ["deep reinforcement learning", "DQN", "PyTorch Lightning", "CartPole", "Gym", "replay buffer", "Q‑network", "training pipeline", "TensorBoard", "neural network"], "summary_hash": "1a4c85ca1443", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:49:39+00:00"}
