{"summary": "A configurable autoencoder base class that assembles an encoder, an optional intermediate processing stage, and a decoder from convolutional (or residual) blocks. It supports arbitrary spatial dimensions, customizable channel sizes, strides, kernel sizes, dilations, activation, normalization, dropout and bias settings, allowing users to build encoder‑decoder networks for reconstruction or representation learning.", "business_intent": "Enable developers of medical imaging and other deep‑learning applications to quickly create and experiment with flexible encoder‑decoder models for unsupervised or self‑supervised tasks such as image reconstruction, denoising, or feature extraction.", "keywords": ["autoencoder", "encoder", "decoder", "convolutional blocks", "residual units", "dilated convolutions", "configurable architecture", "deep learning", "medical imaging", "unsupervised learning", "reconstruction"], "summary_hash": "4a1d5f23c931", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:35:27+00:00"}
