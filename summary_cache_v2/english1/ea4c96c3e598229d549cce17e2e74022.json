{"summary": "Provides core I/O transforms for MONAI that read medical image files into arrays with automatic format selection, write tensors or NumPy images to disk with metadata‑driven naming, channel handling, scaling, and datatype conversion, and safely record original‑to‑new file mappings in JSON. Includes dictionary‑based wrappers that perform the same operations on key‑value data structures within transform pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable robust, flexible, and automated handling of medical imaging data input and output in deep learning workflows, minimizing boilerplate code, preserving essential metadata, and ensuring thread‑safe tracking of file transformations.", "keywords": ["medical imaging", "I/O transforms", "image reading", "image writing", "metadata handling", "channel ordering", "datatype conversion", "JSON mapping", "dictionary wrapper", "MONAI", "deep learning pipeline"], "summary_hash": "86ed2abb320b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:30:54+00:00"}
