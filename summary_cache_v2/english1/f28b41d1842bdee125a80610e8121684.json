{"summary": "A suite of command‑line tools that automate the acquisition, extraction, conversion, augmentation, and metadata generation for a wide range of speech corpora. The utilities download dataset archives, unpack them, optionally resample or apply noise, split and balance the data, and produce standardized manifest files (CSV/JSON) compatible with speech‑recognition training pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable rapid and reproducible preparation of speech‑recognition training data by providing ready‑to‑use scripts that fetch, preprocess, and organize popular audio datasets into formats required by downstream models.", "keywords": ["speech dataset", "download", "extraction", "audio conversion", "WAV", "noise augmentation", "voice activity detection", "room impulse response", "manifest generation", "JSON", "CSV", "parallel processing", "Kaldi", "NeMo", "speech recognition", "preprocessing", "data splitting", "balancing"], "summary_hash": "c2f43013e661", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:13:45+00:00"}
