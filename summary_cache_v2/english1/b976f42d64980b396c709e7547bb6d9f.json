{"summary": "The module implements a comprehensive framework for declaring, organizing, loading, describing, and serializing CKAN configuration options. It introduces immutable hierarchical keys, option metadata with validation rules, and a registry-driven mechanism to handle multiple input and output formats (e.g., INI, JSON, YAML, TOML, reStructuredText). The design supports extensibility through plug‑in loaders, custom describers, and serializers, enabling round‑trip transformation of configuration schemas.", "business_intent": "To provide CKAN with a robust, extensible configuration management system that allows developers and plugins to define configuration options declaratively, validate them, load them from diverse sources, generate documentation and schema representations, and serialize them into various formats for deployment and tooling.", "keywords": ["CKAN", "configuration management", "declaration", "schema", "serialization", "deserialization", "hierarchical keys", "option metadata", "validation", "extensible", "plugins", "INI", "JSON", "YAML", "TOML", "reStructuredText"], "summary_hash": "2619f480d74d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T19:46:39+00:00"}
