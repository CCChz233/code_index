{"summary": "A collection of utility modules that support the Raster Vision framework by handling file operations, GeoJSON processing, and miscellaneous tasks such as image conversion and dictionary manipulation. Functions include downloading and copying files, managing JSON configurations, filtering GeoJSON features, converting AOI definitions to Shapely geometries, converting between NumPy arrays and PNG data, and providing safe process termination.", "business_intent": "Enable robust data preparation, configuration management, and spatial processing within Raster Vision pipelines by abstracting common file system interactions, GeoJSON handling, and image I/O tasks, thereby simplifying development and execution of computer vision workflows.", "keywords": ["file management", "download", "copy", "JSON configuration", "remote sync", "GeoJSON filtering", "AOI conversion", "Shapely geometry", "image I/O", "NumPy", "PNG", "dictionary utilities", "process termination", "Raster Vision"], "summary_hash": "3b46701518d3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:04:01+00:00"}
