{"summary": "The module runs a schistosomiasis simulation, extracts model outputs such as district‑level prevalence and DALYs, and compares them against reference data (e.g., GBD estimates). It builds data frames, generates comparison plots, and reports any discrepancies to confirm that the model behaves as originally intended.", "business_intent": "Provide a validation tool that checks the calibration of the schistosomiasis health‑burden model, ensuring its outputs align with established epidemiological benchmarks for reliable decision‑making and reporting.", "keywords": ["schistosomiasis", "model calibration", "simulation", "prevalence", "DALYs", "GBD", "validation", "epidemiology", "data analysis", "visualization"], "summary_hash": "2dac1e4a6f3f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:55:07+00:00"}
