{"summary": "Provides a class that builds the MODFLOW‑6 groundwater‑to‑groundwater exchange (GWF‑GWF) package for structured grids. It examines a submodel label array together with partition information to locate neighboring cells that belong to different subdomains, then compiles the cell‑index and geometric information required for the exchange package.", "business_intent": "Facilitates the creation of multi‑model groundwater exchange specifications in hydrologic modeling workflows, allowing modelers to automate the setup of inter‑model flow connections across structured grid partitions.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW 6", "groundwater exchange", "structured grid", "submodel partition", "cell adjacency", "hydrologic modeling", "exchange package", "simulation", "grid geometry", "multimodel"], "summary_hash": "63cfc34c8335", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:00:53+00:00"}
