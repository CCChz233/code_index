{"summary": "A test suite dedicated to validating the SAM vision encoder implementation. It adapts generic modeling tests to SAM's unique input handling, checking configuration integrity, forward‑pass outputs such as image features, attention maps and hidden states, gradient propagation, model serialization, and training behaviours including gradient checkpointing.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and stability of the SAM model across different usage scenarios, prevent regressions, and confirm that training and inference pipelines function as expected.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "SAM model", "vision encoder", "configuration validation", "output verification", "hidden states", "attention outputs", "gradient handling", "model checkpointing", "serialization", "pretrained loading", "training pipeline"], "summary_hash": "0d59c8e3c6ff", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:55:50+00:00"}
