{"summary": "We need to produce JSON for the file metaflow/_vendor/click/types.py and metaflow/_vendor/click/utils.py? The prompt says \"Output ONLY valid JSON starting with {{ and ending with }}.\" It seems we need to produce a JSON object summarizing the module? The context includes two file summaries. Possibly we need to produce a combined summary for the module?

The current file is not specified directly, but the context includes two file summaries. The previous request was for testing.py. Now we have types.py and utils.py. Perhaps the user wants a JSON for each? But the instruction says output ONLY a JSON object (single). Might need to combine both? The prompt: \"- metaflow/_vendor/click/types.py: ... - metaflow/_vendor/click/utils.py: ...\" So maybe they want a summary for the package? Or maybe they want a JSON for each file? The instruction says \"Output ONLY valid JSON starting with {{ and ending with }}.\" Not an array. So maybe they want a combined summary of the two modules? Could be a higher-level module that includes both types and utils. But they are separate files. The request ambiguous.\n\nGiven previous pattern: earlier they asked for testing.py and we gave JSON for that file. Now they list two files. Possibly they want a JSON for each file, but they said only one JSON. Could we output an object with keys per file? Eg {\"types\": {...}, \"utils\": {...}}? That would still be a JSON object. But the required keys are summary, business_intent, keywords. That suggests a single module.\n\nMaybe they want a combined summary of the \"click\" submodule's types and utils responsibilities. Could produce a summary that covers both: defines parameter types and helper utilities for CLI.\n\nLet's craft summary: \"Provides core utilities for Click: a collection of parameter type classes handling conversion/validation for various data types, and helper functions for lazy file handling, stream flushing, echoing, and environment path retrieval.\"\n\nBusiness intent: \"Support developers building robust command‑line interfaces by offering ready‑made type converters and common I/O utilities, reducing boilerplate and ensuring consistent behavior.\"\n\nKeywords: [\"parameter types\", \"type conversion\", \"validation\", \"CLI\", \"Click\", \"utility functions\", \"", "business_intent": "We need to produce JSON for the file metaflow/_vendor/click/types.py and metaflow/_vendor/click/utils.py?
