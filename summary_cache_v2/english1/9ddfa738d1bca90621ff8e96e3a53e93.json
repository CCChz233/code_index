{"summary": "Provides utilities to merge a collection of genomic intervals into larger, non‑overlapping clusters that fully contain the original intervals while respecting a maximum cluster size. Each cluster and its constituent intervals are annotated with a generated name, and the results are returned as a structured object linking intervals to their covering clusters.", "business_intent": "Enables bioinformatics workflows to group nearby genomic features into manageable blocks for analysis, visualization, or downstream processing, ensuring clusters stay within user‑defined size limits and preserving traceability between original intervals and their clusters.", "keywords": ["genomic intervals", "interval clustering", "cluster merging", "max size constraint", "contig handling", "convex hull", "overlap detection", "interval naming", "bioinformatics utility"], "summary_hash": "1f95e611f427", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:12:02+00:00"}
