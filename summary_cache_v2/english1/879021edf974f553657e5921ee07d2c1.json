{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class ImmutableMultiDict. It's likely from Werkzeug or similar. It's an immutable mapping that can hold multiple values per key. Provides methods like getlist, items, keys, multi_items, values. So summary: Represents an immutable dictionary that can store multiple values for each key, providing read‑only access and helper methods to retrieve single values, lists of values, and iteration over items.\n\nBusiness intent: Provide a safe, read‑only multi‑value mapping for web request parameters, configuration, or any context where multiple values per key must be preserved without allowing modification.\n\nKeywords: immutable, multivalue dictionary, read‑only, mapping, getlist, items, keys, values, multi_items, web framework, request parameters.\n\nMake sure not to list method names verbatim? The constraint: \"Do NOT list method names verbatim.\" That means in summary and business_intent we should avoid enumerating method names like __contains__, getlist, etc. But we can mention functionality generically. Keywords list can include terms but not method names? Probably okay to include \"getlist\" maybe considered method name. Safer to avoid method names. Use generic terms: \"multi-value\", \"immutable mapping\".
