{"summary": "The module defines an abstract service for retrieving genetic variants that overlap a specified genomic region from one or more VCF files. It provides two concrete strategies: a disk‑based approach that leverages VCF indexes to fetch records on demand, and an in‑memory approach that loads variants into an interval overlap detector for rapid queries. Supporting classes wrap VCF records, classify variant types, and enable optional filtering by minor allele frequency.", "business_intent": "To supply bioinformatics applications with a flexible, efficient mechanism for querying variant data across genomic coordinates, facilitating downstream analyses such as association studies, annotation pipelines, and clinical reporting.", "keywords": ["variant retrieval", "VCF", "genomic interval", "overlap detection", "disk index", "in‑memory cache", "minor allele frequency", "bioinformatics", "pysam", "pybedlite"], "summary_hash": "42bd2c98a1a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:12:17+00:00"}
