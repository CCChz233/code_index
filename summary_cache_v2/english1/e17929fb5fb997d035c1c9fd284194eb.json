{"summary": "The file defines a comprehensive suite of unit tests for Django's caching framework, covering a wide range of cache backends (memory, file‑based, database, Memcached, pylibmc) and middleware components. The tests verify core cache operations (add, set, get, delete, versioning, expiration), bulk actions, key validation, culling behavior, serialization handling, and integration with HTTP request/response handling, template fragment caching, and internationalization. Additional utilities and helper classes support custom key validation, cache table creation, and side‑effect‑free pickling.", "business_intent": "To ensure that Django's caching mechanisms function correctly and reliably across different backends and usage scenarios, helping developers detect regressions, validate configuration, and maintain performance and correctness of cached data in production applications.", "keywords": ["Django", "caching", "unit tests", "cache backends", "memory cache", "file‑based cache", "database cache", "Memcached", "pylibmc", "middleware", "HTTP caching", "template fragment", "internationalization", "key validation", "culling", "serialization", "pickling", "expiration", "versioning", "bulk operations"], "summary_hash": "4bec31be5c08", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:15:52+00:00"}
