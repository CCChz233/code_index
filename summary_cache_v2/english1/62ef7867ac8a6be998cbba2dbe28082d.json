{"summary": "This module contains unit tests that verify the functionality of CTC decoding utilities within the NeMo ASR framework. It checks proper initialization, greedy forward decoding for both character‑level and subword tokenizations, and the generation of hypothesis objects, using simple helper vocabularies and tokenizers.", "business_intent": "Validate and ensure the reliability of speech recognition decoding components so that ASR models can be accurately evaluated and deployed.", "keywords": ["CTC decoding", "greedy decoding", "character tokenization", "subword tokenization", "hypothesis generation", "unit testing", "NeMo", "ASR", "vocabulary", "tokenizer"], "summary_hash": "dc0067a9aa94", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:32:28+00:00"}
