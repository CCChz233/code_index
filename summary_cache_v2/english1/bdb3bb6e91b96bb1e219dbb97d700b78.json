{"summary": "Internal utility class that encapsulates flexible sequence length information, representing a dimension as a series of blocks with start offsets and lengths. It tracks maximum and minimum block sizes, provides both Python list and torch tensor views, and supports two modes: a non‑paged layout where block starts are absolute positions, and a paged layout where starts are relative to per‑batch blocks.", "business_intent": "Facilitate handling of variable‑length sequences for masking and batching in deep‑learning pipelines, enabling efficient computation of intervals, splitting of blocks, and conversion to other representations across different memory layouts.", "keywords": ["sequence metadata", "block offsets", "variable length", "masking", "torch tensor", "non‑paged layout", "paged layout", "interval calculation", "splitting", "conversion"], "summary_hash": "3e66e8e824f2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:23:01+00:00"}
