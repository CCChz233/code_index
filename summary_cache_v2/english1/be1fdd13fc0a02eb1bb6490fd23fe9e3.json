{"summary": "The module defines mock backend components used in test suites to emulate the behavior of a full machine‑learning backend. It includes lightweight implementations of a backend, its configuration, and a configuration builder that handle model loading, training, prediction, and scene data interactions without performing real computation.", "business_intent": "Provide a fast, dependency‑free stand‑in for the actual backend so that developers can run integration and unit tests of Raster Vision pipelines, verify configuration handling, and ensure code paths work correctly without requiring heavy model training or external resources.", "keywords": ["mock backend", "testing", "Raster Vision", "configuration", "protobuf", "model loading simulation", "training simulation", "prediction simulation", "scene handling", "unit tests"], "summary_hash": "a96b0a6a8a3d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:52:23+00:00"}
