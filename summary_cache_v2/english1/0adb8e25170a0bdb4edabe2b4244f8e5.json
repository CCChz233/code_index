{"summary": "The module offers example scripts that illustrate how to train a Transformer‑based Denoising AutoEncoder (TSDAE) on raw sentence collections and assess the resulting sentence embeddings, particularly using the AskUbuntu question dataset. It covers model construction, data handling, TSDAE loss configuration, training loops with checkpointing, and evaluation of retrieval metrics.", "business_intent": "Enable users to generate high‑quality unsupervised sentence embeddings via TSDAE for downstream semantic similarity, search, and clustering applications, providing a ready‑to‑run reference implementation.", "keywords": ["TSDAE", "unsupervised learning", "sentence embeddings", "Transformer", "denoising autoencoder", "AskUbuntu", "training script", "evaluation", "SentenceTransformer", "model checkpointing"], "summary_hash": "e496e69168e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:00:21+00:00"}
