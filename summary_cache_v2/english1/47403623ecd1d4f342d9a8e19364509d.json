{"summary": "The module defines a core class that orchestrates the preparation of MetaSWAP model inputs, handling validation of configuration parameters (e.g., land‑use, vegetation, initial conditions), checking for required external packages, and rendering consistent input files based on a chosen unsaturated‑soil database. It also provides a simple mutable‑mapping utility for storing arbitrary key‑value pairs.", "business_intent": "Enable users to programmatically configure, validate, and generate all necessary input files for running the MetaSWAP hydrological simulation, reducing manual setup effort and ensuring consistency across model components.", "keywords": ["MetaSWAP", "hydrological model", "configuration validation", "input file generation", "land use", "vegetation", "unsaturated soil database", "required packages", "initial conditions", "mapping", "mutable mapping", "templating", "Jinja2", "numpy", "pathlib"], "summary_hash": "1a5b500ff8ee", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:44:05+00:00"}
