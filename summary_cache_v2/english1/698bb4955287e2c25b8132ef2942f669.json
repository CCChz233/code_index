{"summary": "The module defines a collection of reusable graph transformation classes for DGL, covering topology modifications (adding/removing nodes or edges, self‑loops, reverse edges, line and Levi graphs, simplification), edge weight processing (normalization, diffusion, heat kernel, personalized PageRank, SIGN), positional encoding generation (Laplacian, random walk, SVD, etc.), feature manipulation (masking, row normalization, shuffling), and a composable container to chain multiple transforms.", "business_intent": "Equip developers and researchers with ready‑to‑use, composable tools for preprocessing, augmenting, and enriching graph data prior to training graph neural networks, thereby streamlining experimentation and improving model performance.", "keywords": ["graph transformation", "DGL", "topology modification", "self‑loop", "reverse edge", "line graph", "Levi graph", "graph simplification", "edge normalization", "graph diffusion", "heat kernel", "personalized PageRank", "SIGN diffusion", "positional encoding", "Laplacian", "random walk", "SVD", "feature masking", "row normalization", "node shuffling", "compose transforms", "graph preprocessing", "graph neural networks"], "summary_hash": "50215d280108", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:58:26+00:00"}
