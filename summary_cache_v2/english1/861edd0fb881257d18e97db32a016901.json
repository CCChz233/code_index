{"summary": "Implements a differential image‑to‑image generation pipeline for the Flux family of diffusion models. It encodes input images into latent space with a VAE, extracts textual conditioning from CLIP and T5 encoders, prepares and packs latents, runs a conditional transformer denoiser guided by a scheduler, and decodes the refined latents back to images.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to transform existing images according to natural‑language prompts, supporting applications such as visual content creation, marketing material adaptation, product design iteration, and personalized media generation.", "keywords": ["image-to-image", "diffusion", "Flux", "transformer", "VAE", "CLIP", "T5", "scheduler", "latent space", "prompt conditioning", "AI art", "generative model"], "summary_hash": "66393ef579e8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:29:16+00:00"}
