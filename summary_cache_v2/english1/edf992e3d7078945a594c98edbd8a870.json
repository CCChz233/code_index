{"summary": "The module provides a dictionary‑based transform that simulates a random high‑intensity spike (herring) artifact directly in the k‑space representation of MRI data. It operates on a mapping of tensors, randomly selects a subset of specified entries, injects a spike with intensity drawn from a configurable range, and can apply the effect per channel or globally while gracefully handling missing keys.", "business_intent": "Offer researchers and clinicians a simple, configurable tool to generate realistic MRI k‑space spike artifacts for preprocessing, data augmentation, and robustness testing of deep‑learning models, thereby improving model generalization to acquisition‑related distortions.", "keywords": ["k-space spike", "MRI artifact", "random spike injection", "dictionary transform", "data augmentation", "medical imaging", "artifact simulation", "intensity perturbation", "per‑channel option", "global setting", "preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "f59c31df8e15", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:30:16+00:00"}
