{"summary": "Manages the collection of tensors (including nested lists/tuples) generated by multiple distributed processes, gathering them in chunks onto the CPU while preserving the original dataset order. It handles padding for variable-length sequences, ensures the total number of samples aligns with a specified multiple (typically the world size), and provides mechanisms to incrementally add partial results and produce a final, correctly ordered tensor collection.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that predictions or other tensor outputs from distributed inference are correctly aligned with the original dataset indices, eliminating ordering errors and duplication, and delivering a ready‑to‑use CPU‑resident result for downstream evaluation or storage.", "keywords": ["distributed training", "tensor gathering", "CPU aggregation", "order preservation", "padding", "multiple of world size", "nested tensors", "chunked collection", "synchronization", "prediction alignment"], "summary_hash": "1feadd8cf186", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:21:35+00:00"}
