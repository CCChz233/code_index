{"summary": "This module provides a complete implementation of the SwiGLU activation function for transformer models. It offers a PyTorch nn.Module wrapper that invokes an optimized xformers operator, defines an abstract operator interface, a runtime dispatcher that selects the best implementation based on device and data type, and two concrete operator variants: a high‑performance fused GPU kernel and a clear reference (decomposed) version. Supporting utilities handle bias inclusion, mixed‑precision/autocast checks, and integration with PyTorch's autograd system.", "business_intent": "Enable faster training and inference of transformer architectures by supplying an efficient, hardware‑aware SwiGLU activation that automatically chooses the optimal kernel while preserving compatibility with PyTorch's autograd and mixed‑precision workflows.", "keywords": ["SwiGLU", "activation function", "transformer", "fused kernel", "GPU acceleration", "autograd integration", "runtime dispatcher", "mixed precision", "bias handling", "xformers", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "fc75038dacf1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:34:26+00:00"}
