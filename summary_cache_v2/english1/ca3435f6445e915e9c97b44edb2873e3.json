{"summary": "This module defines a set of expression classes that form the building blocks of a parsing grammar. The classes support literals, regular expressions, sequences, alternatives, optional and repeated patterns, as well as zero‑width lookahead and negative lookahead. They provide matching logic, error handling, and conversion to parse‑tree nodes, enabling the construction and evaluation of complex grammars.", "business_intent": "To supply the core components of a parsing engine, allowing developers to compose expressive grammar rules and parse input text into structured parse trees.", "keywords": ["parsing", "grammar", "expression", "literal", "regex", "sequence", "alternatives", "optional", "repetition", "lookahead", "negative lookahead", "token", "match", "parse tree", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "74ce4bea7517", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:42:00+00:00"}
