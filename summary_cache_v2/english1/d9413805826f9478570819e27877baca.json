{"summary": "Implements a one‑dimensional convolutional layer that slides learnable kernels over sequential inputs to produce transformed feature maps. Supports configurable filter count, kernel size, stride, padding modes (valid, same, causal), dilation, channel grouping, optional bias addition, activation functions, and various initializers, regularizers and constraints.", "business_intent": "Enables neural networks to extract local patterns and hierarchical representations from time‑series, audio, or any ordered data, facilitating tasks such as signal processing, speech recognition, and temporal sequence modeling.", "keywords": ["1D convolution", "temporal convolution", "kernel", "stride", "padding", "causal", "dilation", "grouped convolution", "activation", "bias", "regularizer", "constraint", "Keras layer"], "summary_hash": "a8ac73bd19e4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:55:27+00:00"}
