{"summary": "The module defines a suite of unit tests that validate the functionality of several quantum adder circuit implementations. It checks that each adder correctly computes the sum of binary inputs, raises appropriate exceptions for mismatched bit-widths, and that the overall addition behavior matches expected results using statevector simulations.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the correctness and robustness of quantum arithmetic primitives, enabling reliable construction of higher‑level quantum algorithms that depend on accurate addition operations.", "keywords": ["quantum adder", "ripple carry adder", "QFT adder", "unit testing", "Qiskit", "statevector simulation", "error handling", "bit width validation", "quantum circuit verification", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "6e6d8867e9f6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:00:09+00:00"}
