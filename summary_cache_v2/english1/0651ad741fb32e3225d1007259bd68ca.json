{"summary": "A mixin that equips a top‑level model with an encoder by adding a configurable collection of adapter modules. It stores adapters in a module dictionary, tracks their configuration, and provides utilities to add, resolve, enable, and query adapters while ensuring they follow the required input‑output shape and zero‑initialized residual behavior.", "business_intent": "Enable easy integration and management of lightweight adapter layers for FastPitch‑style models, facilitating domain adaptation, fine‑tuning, and modular extension without altering the core encoder architecture.", "keywords": ["adapter", "mixin", "encoder", "PyTorch", "module dictionary", "configuration", "residual connection", "zero‑initialization", "FastPitch", "fine‑tuning", "domain adaptation"], "summary_hash": "efd930bf20f2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:46:41+00:00"}
