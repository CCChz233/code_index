{"summary": "Provides a collection of utilities that enable and simplify distributed training in Lightning Fabric. It includes wrappers that adapt arbitrary samplers for multi‑process data loading, a dataset‑like interface for samplers, an infinite barrier for process synchronization, and a suite of helper functions for initializing, tearing down, and interacting with the PyTorch distributed backend (e.g., all‑gather, thread configuration, filesystem checks).", "business_intent": "To abstract away the complexities of setting up and managing distributed data parallel workflows, ensuring that data sampling, synchronization, and communication work transparently across multiple processes and devices, thereby accelerating model training at scale.", "keywords": ["distributed training", "sampler wrapper", "dataset wrapper", "process synchronization", "all-gather", "process group", "thread management", "shared filesystem", "PyTorch", "DDP", "Lightning Fabric"], "summary_hash": "e0bcfb7ba3de", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:03:01+00:00"}
