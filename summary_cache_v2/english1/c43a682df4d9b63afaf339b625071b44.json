{"summary": "Provides a compact example of a character‑level GPT‑style transformer language model built with PyTorch Lightning. It defines a dataset class for handling sequences of characters, a configurable transformer model class with weight initialization, optimizer configuration, forward pass, training step, and learning‑rate scheduling, and includes auxiliary utilities for top‑k logit filtering and text sampling.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate how to train and generate text with a small GPT model, serving as an educational reference or quick‑start template for developers building custom language models.", "keywords": ["GPT", "transformer", "language model", "character dataset", "PyTorch Lightning", "training loop", "learning rate schedule", "top‑k filtering", "text generation", "xformers"], "summary_hash": "8c18944579ec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:27:29+00:00"}
