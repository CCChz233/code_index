{"summary": "EnsembleEvaluator orchestrates the validation of a collection of PyTorch models as an ensemble. It iterates over a validation data loader, prepares each batch, runs inference on each network using a configurable inferer, optionally applies post‑processing, and aggregates the predictions under distinct keys. Throughout the epoch it records metrics, supports mixed‑precision, custom event handling, and checkpointing, finally exposing the list of predictions for downstream processing.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable workflow to assess the performance of multiple models combined, enabling reliable model selection, benchmarking, and deployment decisions in production pipelines that require ensemble predictions and metric tracking.", "keywords": ["ensemble", "model evaluation", "inference", "PyTorch", "Ignite", "validation", "metrics", "mixed precision", "postprocessing", "batch preparation", "checkpointing", "custom events", "device management"], "summary_hash": "b8df6a764381", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:11:44+00:00"}
