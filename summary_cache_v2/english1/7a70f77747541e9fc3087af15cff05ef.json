{"summary": "This module implements a fused 1‑dimensional batch‑normalization layer optimized for Conformer‑based speech models, serving as a drop‑in replacement for the standard BatchNorm1d with an added affine projection. It also provides utilities to automatically swap existing batch‑norm layers in a model with this fused version.", "business_intent": "Enhance the training speed, inference efficiency, and accuracy of automatic speech recognition and text‑to‑speech models by using a specialized batch‑norm implementation tailored for Conformer architectures.", "keywords": ["batch normalization", "fused", "1D", "Conformer", "ASR", "speech recognition", "PyTorch", "model optimization", "layer replacement", "performance"], "summary_hash": "f0e3d13d703f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:14:35+00:00"}
