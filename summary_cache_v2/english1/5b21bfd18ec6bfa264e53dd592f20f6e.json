{"summary": "Abstract base class representing a logical quantum control channel. It stores a type identifier and an index, provides validation, naming, and parameter handling, and defines equality, hashing and string representation. Concrete subclasses supply a unique prefix to form serialized names that backends translate to physical signal lines.", "business_intent": "Enable Qiskit to refer to hardware control signals in a backend‑agnostic way, allowing developers to create new channel types that can be uniquely identified, compared, and parameterized, while delegating the actual hardware mapping to the backend.", "keywords": ["quantum", "channel", "Qiskit", "hardware abstraction", "prefix", "index", "serialization", "backend mapping", "parameterized"], "summary_hash": "4a20be573802", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:01:30+00:00"}
