{"summary": "Implements the pre‑layer‑normalization attention block used in the RoBERTa transformer model within the Flax (JAX) framework. The class computes multi‑head self‑attention, applies a layer‑norm before the attention operation, and returns the transformed token representations.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, high‑performance attention component for building, fine‑tuning, or deploying RoBERTa‑based natural language processing models in production environments.", "keywords": ["attention", "transformer", "RoBERTa", "Flax", "pre‑layer norm", "JAX", "NLP", "model layer"], "summary_hash": "d85d1ca60cf1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:10:59+00:00"}
