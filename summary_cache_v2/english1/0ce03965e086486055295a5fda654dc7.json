{"summary": "A collection of unit tests that verify the functionality of label handling classes for various computer‑vision tasks, including chip‑level classification, object‑detection bounding boxes, and semantic‑segmentation rasters. The tests cover operations such as extending and concatenating label sets, accessing individual and grouped entries, extracting class IDs, querying overlaps, converting coordinate systems, reporting sizes, handling empty or singleton collections, and removing duplicates.", "business_intent": "Guarantee reliable label data structures for machine‑learning pipelines, ensuring accurate training and evaluation of classification, detection, and segmentation models and preventing data‑related errors in production.", "keywords": ["unit tests", "label collection", "chip classification", "object detection", "semantic segmentation", "bounding boxes", "overlap query", "coordinate conversion", "duplicate removal", "raster data"], "summary_hash": "22a4ef6b652e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:03:36+00:00"}
