{"summary": "The module defines a metric class that computes confusion‑matrix‑based evaluation scores for binary, multi‑class, or multi‑label predictions. It supports optional background channel exclusion, per‑sample or aggregated computation, various reduction modes, and can also output the raw counts of valid entries. Helper utilities are provided for name validation and accessing the underlying confusion matrix.", "business_intent": "Enable developers of medical imaging and deep‑learning models to assess segmentation or classification performance using flexible, standardized confusion‑matrix metrics within the MONAI framework.", "keywords": ["confusion matrix", "evaluation metric", "binary classification", "multi‑class", "multi‑label", "background exclusion", "metric reduction", "MONAI", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "5fe0c45fcd50", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:13:04+00:00"}
