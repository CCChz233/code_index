{"summary": "This module implements a discrete diffusion scheduler based on the KDPM2 algorithm, offering configurable beta or sigma schedules, timestep spacing, and prediction types to guide the reverse diffusion process during model inference. It also defines a lightweight container for the scheduler's step output, encapsulating the previous sample and the denoised prediction.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient and flexible inference for diffusion-based generative AI models, such as image synthesis, by providing a robust scheduler that controls the denoising trajectory and improves sample quality and speed.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "KDPM2", "discrete", "beta schedule", "sigma schedule", "timestep spacing", "inference", "denoising", "generative AI", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "c4bb41956ebd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:12:36+00:00"}
