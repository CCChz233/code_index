{"summary": "CloudformationLocalGraph parses a CloudFormation (or SAM) template and builds an in‑memory graph where each resource, attribute, and intrinsic function is represented as a vertex. It creates edges that capture dependencies such as Ref, GetAtt, Fn::If, Fn::Sub, FindInMap, and SAM global configurations, and provides utilities to update vertex metadata, extract resource attributes, and query the graph for resource types or deep keys.", "business_intent": "Enable automated analysis, validation, and visualization of CloudFormation templates by constructing a detailed dependency graph that can be used for security scanning, compliance checks, impact analysis, and tooling integrations.", "keywords": ["cloudformation", "graph", "dependency", "resource", "intrinsic function", "SAM", "template parsing", "vertex", "edge", "ref", "getatt", "fn::if", "fn::sub", "findinmap", "configuration", "analysis"], "summary_hash": "cb746eb133db", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:15:19+00:00"}
