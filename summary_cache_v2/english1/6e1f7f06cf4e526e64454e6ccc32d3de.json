{"summary": "Represents a normalized description of a grid specification, translating the abstract grid layout into the concrete argument ordering required by the pallas_call primitive, its kernel, and associated index map functions. It validates internal consistency, provides access to input and output shapes, determines which dimensions are mapped, handles dynamic and static grid bounds, and supports operations such as slicing, replacement, and environment tracing for block, index, and scratch operands.", "business_intent": "Facilitate correct and efficient compilation of GPU kernels by encapsulating the mapping logic between high‑level grid specifications and low‑level call signatures, ensuring that kernels receive properly ordered and shaped arguments while allowing transformations like slicing and substitution during optimization passes.", "keywords": ["grid mapping", "kernel call convention", "dynamic grid sizes", "shape inference", "invariant checking", "dimension mapping", "operand slicing", "substitution", "trace environment", "GPU kernel compilation"], "summary_hash": "ae15d20d0851", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:37:32+00:00"}
