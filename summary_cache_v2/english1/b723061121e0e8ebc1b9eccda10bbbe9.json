{"summary": "The script orchestrates the creation of confidence‑based ensembles from multiple pretrained speech‑recognition models. It parses a configuration (YAML or command‑line), loads the specified models, optionally tunes confidence‑scoring and logistic‑regression parameters using a development set via grid search, computes confidence measures for each model, selects the optimal combination, and saves the resulting ensemble as a checkpoint.", "business_intent": "Provide a tool that lets users boost speech‑recognition performance by automatically combining several ASR models based on confidence metrics, with optional parameter tuning to achieve higher accuracy without manual model selection.", "keywords": ["ensemble", "confidence", "ASR", "speech recognition", "model aggregation", "tuning", "logistic regression", "grid search", "configuration", "checkpoint"], "summary_hash": "57d08331f5b9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:45:23+00:00"}
