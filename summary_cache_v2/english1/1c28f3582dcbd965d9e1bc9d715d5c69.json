{"summary": "The module defines a pipeline manager that orchestrates the preparation and execution of a graph‑based prediction workflow. It loads and merges YAML configurations, renders command scripts from Jinja2 templates, and constructs the necessary data, model, and pipeline components using factory helpers. The manager also integrates a user‑provided configuration class and provides a command‑line entry point for running the generated script.", "business_intent": "Enable users to easily apply a trained graph neural network model to new datasets by automatically handling configuration merging, script generation, and component assembly, thereby simplifying the deployment of graph prediction tasks.", "keywords": ["graph prediction", "pipeline automation", "configuration management", "script generation", "Jinja2 template", "YAML merging", "factory pattern", "DGL", "PyTorch", "command line interface"], "summary_hash": "b297025b226f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:01:10+00:00"}
