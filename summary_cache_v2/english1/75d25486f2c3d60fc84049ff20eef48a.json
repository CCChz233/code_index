{"summary": "The module provides an example script that demonstrates how to perform gradient accumulation when fine‑tuning a transformer model for sequence classification. It loads a dataset, tokenizes the text, builds data loaders, sets up an optimizer and learning‑rate scheduler, and runs a training loop that accumulates gradients over multiple steps before updating model parameters, using the Accelerate library for distributed and mixed‑precision support.", "business_intent": "Illustrate a practical approach for training large‑batch transformer models on limited GPU resources by accumulating gradients, helping developers improve model performance without requiring additional hardware.", "keywords": ["gradient accumulation", "accelerate", "transformers", "sequence classification", "tokenization", "dataloader", "optimizer", "learning rate scheduler", "PyTorch", "distributed training"], "summary_hash": "8ef7c8d620a3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:16:47+00:00"}
