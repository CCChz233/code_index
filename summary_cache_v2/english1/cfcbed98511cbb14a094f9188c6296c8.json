{"summary": "The module defines a comprehensive set of unit tests that verify CuPy's histogram‑related functionality, including histogram creation, bin counting, digitization, and handling of special floating‑point values. It exercises a wide range of data types, bin configurations, weighting, density calculations, and error conditions to ensure behavior matches NumPy's reference implementation.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness, robustness, and NumPy compatibility of CuPy's statistical operations (histogram, digitize, bincount) across diverse data types and edge‑case scenarios, thereby supporting reliable scientific computing on GPU.", "keywords": ["CuPy", "histogram", "digitize", "bincount", "unit testing", "NumPy compatibility", "data types", "edge cases", "NaN handling", "Infinity handling", "error validation"], "summary_hash": "eb60e6c27537", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:28:53+00:00"}
