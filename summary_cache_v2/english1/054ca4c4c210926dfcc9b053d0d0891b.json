{"summary": "This module defines a hierarchy of classes that model the various C API slots used in Python type objects. Each class encapsulates the metadata, code snippets, and helper methods required to generate the appropriate C structures for constructors, methods, members, rich comparisons, garbage‑collection hooks, and other special slots. The module also provides utilities for looking up slots by name and assembling slot tables, enabling the Cython compiler to emit correct type definitions and initialization code.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the automatic generation of C-level type slot definitions for Cython‑compiled extension types, ensuring that method tables, member tables, and other special slots are correctly described and emitted during compilation.", "keywords": ["Cython", "compiler", "type slots", "code generation", "Python C API", "method table", "member table", "rich comparison", "signature", "slot descriptor", "garbage collection", "initialization"], "summary_hash": "94da17a670c3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:26:57+00:00"}
