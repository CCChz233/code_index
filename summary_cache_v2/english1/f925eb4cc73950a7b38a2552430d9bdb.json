{"summary": "Implements the Pseudo Numerical Diffusion Model (PNDM) scheduler used to iteratively denoise latent variables during diffusion model inference. The module defines a scheduler class that manages timestep progression, computes model output scaling, variance, and supports different prediction types and solver orders. It also provides a helper to generate beta schedules from a target alpha‑bar curve.", "business_intent": "Supply a ready‑to‑use scheduler component for diffusion‑based generative AI pipelines, enabling fast and stable sampling of images or other data by applying the PNDM algorithm with configurable parameters.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "PNDM", "scheduler", "beta schedule", "alpha bar", "noise reduction", "timesteps", "inference", "generative AI", "torch", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "34524e51f7d1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:12:11+00:00"}
