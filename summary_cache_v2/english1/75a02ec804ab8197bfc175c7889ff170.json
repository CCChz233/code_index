{"summary": "Provides a generic token‑level classification module for sequential NLP inputs. It constructs a classifier head (using a multilayer perceptron), defines the expected neural types for token embeddings and output logits, and implements a forward pass that produces per‑token logits for downstream sequence labeling tasks.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to quickly assemble and train token classification models (e.g., NER, POS tagging) within the NeMo ecosystem by offering a reusable, type‑checked classifier component.", "keywords": ["token classification", "sequence labeling", "NLP", "NeMo", "multilayer perceptron", "logits", "neural types", "model head", "token embeddings"], "summary_hash": "29eab7c2e59b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:21:24+00:00"}
