{"summary": "The module provides example command‑line scripts that demonstrate how to configure, train, fine‑tune, and evaluate end‑to‑end automatic speech recognition models based on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). It shows the full workflow from Hydra/YAML configuration through model initialization, vocabulary handling (character or byte‑pair encoding), data loader setup, optimizer configuration, and optional restoration from pretrained checkpoints, using NVIDIA NeMo and PyTorch Lightning.", "business_intent": "Help developers and researchers quickly prototype, benchmark, and adapt CTC‑based speech‑to‑text systems, including custom tokenizers and pretrained model fine‑tuning, thereby accelerating ASR product development and research.", "keywords": ["speech recognition", "CTC", "ASR", "training", "fine‑tuning", "evaluation", "NeMo", "Hydra", "PyTorch Lightning", "tokenizer", "byte‑pair encoding", "character model", "pretrained"], "summary_hash": "7f093f4333a9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:57:04+00:00"}
