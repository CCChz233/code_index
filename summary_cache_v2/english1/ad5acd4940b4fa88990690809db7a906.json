{"summary": "The module generates synthetic graph datasets using a symmetric stochastic block model mixture, offering configurable parameters such as graph count, node count, community count, average degree, and random seed. It includes mechanisms for caching generated graphs, loading and saving them, and provides utilities for batching the data in a format compatible with PyTorch and DGL.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and engineers to quickly obtain reproducible synthetic graph data for training and evaluating graph neural network models, facilitating benchmarking and experimentation on community-structured networks.", "keywords": ["stochastic block model", "synthetic graph generation", "graph dataset", "DGL", "PyTorch", "graph neural networks", "caching", "batch collation", "community structure", "benchmarking"], "summary_hash": "6466cdde25b5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:39:27+00:00"}
