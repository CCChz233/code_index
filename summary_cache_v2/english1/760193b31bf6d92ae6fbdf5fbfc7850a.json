{"summary": "This module provides abstractions for launching and managing aiohttp web applications. It includes runners that control the lifecycle of the underlying asynchronous server and site objects that bind the server to various transport endpoints such as TCP sockets, Unix domain sockets, and named pipes. The code handles configuration validation, address resolution, activation, deactivation, graceful shutdown, and cleanup of resources, as well as optional access logging.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to start, stop, and manage aiohttp-powered web services across multiple network transports with automated resource management, graceful termination, and logging support.", "keywords": ["aiohttp", "web server", "runner", "site", "TCP", "Unix socket", "named pipe", "asynchronous", "lifecycle management", "graceful shutdown", "resource cleanup", "access logging"], "summary_hash": "d1518aebc93f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:07:31+00:00"}
