{"summary": "The compiler package offers a suite of high‑level utilities that convert quantum circuits and pulse schedules into backend‑compatible representations. It handles assembly into Qobj objects, scheduling of circuits into pulse schedules, sequencing of scheduled circuits into hardware‑specific pulse instructions, and full transpilation with optimization passes tailored to target devices.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with tools to compile and optimize quantum programs for execution on specific quantum hardware or simulators, ensuring correct formatting, timing, and performance tuning for reliable and efficient quantum computation.", "keywords": ["quantum compilation", "circuit transpilation", "pulse scheduling", "backend compatibility", "Qobj generation", "hardware optimization", "instruction mapping"], "summary_hash": "f3e28922551b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:02:49+00:00"}
