{"summary": "The module defines a suite of unit tests for the GlobalNet architecture and its affine transformation head within the MONAI library. It creates synthetic input tensors, runs the components, checks that the output shapes match expectations, and verifies that the models can be scripted and saved correctly using parameterized test cases.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and correctness of global network components used in medical imaging deep learning pipelines, supporting quality assurance and continuous integration for the MONAI framework.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "GlobalNet", "AffineHead", "shape verification", "MONAI", "PyTorch", "scriptability", "parameterized tests", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "cc00524d6d1d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:33:28+00:00"}
