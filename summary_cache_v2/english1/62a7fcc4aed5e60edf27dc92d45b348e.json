{"summary": "Implements a pass that monitors successive DAG executions to identify a relative semi‑stable or local minimum point. It records the state of relevant property‑set fields, keeps a deep copy of the best DAG seen, and after a configurable backtrack depth either signals that a fixed point has been reached or restores the previously stored minimum, thereby providing a loop‑break condition for optimization processes where a true fixed point may never occur.", "business_intent": "Enable iterative synthesis or optimization workflows to terminate automatically when further improvements cease, either by detecting a stable configuration or by reverting to the best observed solution after a set number of iterations, improving efficiency and preventing endless loops.", "keywords": ["minimum point detection", "semi‑stable", "DAG", "optimization loop", "backtrack depth", "property set", "fixed point alternative", "early termination", "state tracking", "deep copy"], "summary_hash": "5a166d6f0cc2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:46:28+00:00"}
