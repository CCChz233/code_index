{"summary": "This module bundles command‑line utilities for training and running inference with the Imagen multi‑stage text‑to‑image diffusion model. It leverages NeMo, Hydra configuration, and PyTorch Lightning to orchestrate the base 64×64 diffusion model and subsequent super‑resolution stages (256×256, 1024×1024). The scripts handle checkpoint loading, text encoder setup, sampler configuration, and image output, and include a helper for generating image sets for FID evaluation.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and product teams with an end‑to‑end pipeline to train, fine‑tune, and generate photorealistic images from textual prompts, accelerating development of generative AI applications and enabling quantitative quality assessment.", "keywords": ["Imagen", "text-to-image", "diffusion model", "UNet", "super‑resolution", "NeMo", "Hydra", "PyTorch Lightning", "training pipeline", "inference pipeline", "FID evaluation", "classifier‑free guidance", "GPU memory optimization", "FP16", "FP32", "AMP"], "summary_hash": "40ae4e2cef25", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:56:46+00:00"}
