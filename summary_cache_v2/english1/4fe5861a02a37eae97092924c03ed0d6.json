{"summary": "A dictionary-based transform that generates watershed markers from a mask and an instance border map. It thresholds the border map, applies a disk-shaped opening, removes small objects, optionally runs a post‑processing function, converts the result to a specified dtype, and stores the markers under a configurable output key.", "business_intent": "Prepare reliable marker images for watershed‑based instance segmentation in pathology workflows, enabling downstream analysis of cellular structures.", "keywords": ["watershed", "markers", "segmentation", "thresholding", "morphological opening", "size filtering", "postprocessing", "dictionary transform", "pathology", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "17b02f6ce02d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:15:12+00:00"}
