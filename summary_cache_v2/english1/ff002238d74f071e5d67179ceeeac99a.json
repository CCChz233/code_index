{"summary": "The module defines a set of performance benchmarks for core attention operations such as batched matrix multiplication, masked matrix multiplication, sparse‑dense‑dense multiplication, and softmax, using predefined tensor shapes and sparsity patterns. It leverages PyTorch's benchmarking utilities to time these kernels and report results.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to measure and compare the speed of fundamental attention primitives, facilitating optimization decisions and hardware evaluation for transformer models.", "keywords": ["benchmarking", "attention", "sparse matrix multiplication", "masked matmul", "softmax", "performance measurement", "torch", "xformers", "core operations"], "summary_hash": "bb6fe23a95cd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:28:32+00:00"}
