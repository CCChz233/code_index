{"summary": "The module implements a voxelization utility that transforms layered spatial datasets into a regular three‑dimensional voxel grid. It leverages a compiled aggregation routine (via Numba) that is built once and reused, exposing a Voxelizer class for repeated conversions without incurring additional JIT overhead.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient preprocessing of geospatial or scientific data into voxel form for downstream analysis, modeling, or simulation pipelines.", "keywords": ["voxelization", "spatial data", "regular grid", "Numba JIT", "aggregation", "Xarray", "NumPy", "data preparation", "reusable tool"], "summary_hash": "cf8ee612e4b0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:45:42+00:00"}
