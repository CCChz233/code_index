{"summary": "This module implements a Graph Attention Network Embedding (GATNE) model for heterogeneous graphs using DGL and PyTorch. It provides classes for the embedding architecture, a custom loss function, and a neighbor sampler to generate mini‑batches, along with utilities to load a graph and run a training loop.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑use solution for learning low‑dimensional node representations in multi‑relational networks, supporting downstream tasks like link prediction, recommendation, or node classification in large‑scale graph applications.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "GATNE", "heterogeneous graph", "node embedding", "DGL", "PyTorch", "neighbor sampling", "custom loss", "representation learning", "graph analytics"], "summary_hash": "2eca6b2843f0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:31:14+00:00"}
