{"summary": "This module defines utilities for applying permutations to qubits in a quantum circuit. It includes a legacy circuit representation that directly encodes a qubit reordering and a modern gate representation that supports synthesis, validation, QASM2 decomposition, inversion, and array conversion.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable way for developers to reorder qubit registers according to a specified permutation, ensuring compatibility with existing codebases while offering a more flexible and extensible gate‑based approach for new circuit constructions and optimizations.", "keywords": ["permutation", "quantum circuit", "gate", "qubit reordering", "synthesis", "QASM2", "backward compatibility", "validation", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "80938010083e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:14:52+00:00"}
