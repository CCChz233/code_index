{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have file for Kolors image-to-image pipeline. Provide description: It defines a pipeline class that extends diffusion pipeline, handling image-to-image generation using Kolors model, integrating adapters, LoRA, VAE, UNet, text encoder, tokenizers, schedulers, callbacks, etc. It processes input images, encodes, adds noise, runs diffusion steps, decodes latents to images. Also includes utility functions retrieve_latents and retrieve_timesteps (placeholders).
