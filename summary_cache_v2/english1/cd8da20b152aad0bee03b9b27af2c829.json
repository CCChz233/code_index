{"summary": "The module contains helper utilities for creating test graphs and a comprehensive set of unit tests that validate graph sampling operations such as neighbor sampling (including biased, top‑k, edge‑type specific, and edge‑exclusion variants), random walks (uniform, non‑uniform, node2vec), and negative sampling. Each test constructs a small graph, invokes the corresponding sampling function from the backend, and asserts that the sampled nodes or edges match the expected outcomes.", "business_intent": "Ensure the correctness and reliability of graph sampling primitives used in graph‑based machine learning workflows, providing confidence that downstream models receive accurate neighbor and walk information.", "keywords": ["graph sampling", "neighbor sampling", "biased sampling", "top‑k sampling", "edge type", "edge exclusion", "random walk", "node2vec", "negative sampling", "unit testing", "DGL", "graph neural networks", "machine learning"], "summary_hash": "1115d525d020", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:05:01+00:00"}
