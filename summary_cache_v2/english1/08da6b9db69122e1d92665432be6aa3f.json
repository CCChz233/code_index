{"summary": "The module defines a LocalGraph class that builds and maintains an in‑memory graph representation of infrastructure resources. It creates vertices and edges from input data, computes derived attributes such as encryption status, classifies resources, and provides methods for querying and updating the graph structure.", "business_intent": "Enable security and compliance analysis tools to traverse and evaluate infrastructure-as-code configurations by offering a rich, mutable graph model that captures resource relationships, attributes, and classification details.", "keywords": ["graph", "local graph", "vertices", "edges", "attribute computation", "encryption flag", "resource classification", "query", "update", "infrastructure-as-code", "security analysis", "Checkov"], "summary_hash": "2d48bd3da56b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T19:43:59+00:00"}
