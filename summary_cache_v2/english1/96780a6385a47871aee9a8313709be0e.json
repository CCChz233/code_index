{"summary": "Provides an MXNet implementation of the NNConv graph convolution layer, which transforms edge features into weight matrices via a user-defined function, applies these weights to source node features, aggregates messages (sum, mean, or max), and optionally adds residual connections and bias, supporting both homogeneous and bipartite graph structures.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to incorporate edge‑conditioned graph convolution operations into MXNet‑based deep learning pipelines for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph‑level prediction across various domains.", "keywords": ["MXNet", "DGL", "graph neural network", "NNConv", "edge‑conditioned convolution", "message passing", "aggregation", "residual connection", "bias", "bipartite graph"], "summary_hash": "c5a75b9d8c12", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:43:37+00:00"}
