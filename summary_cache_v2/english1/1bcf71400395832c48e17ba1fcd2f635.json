{"summary": "A command‑line script that fine‑tunes a pretrained hybrid ASR‑with‑TTS model using text‑only corpora, optionally combined with audio‑text pairs. It parses Hydra configurations, loads specified ASR, TTS, and optional enhancer checkpoints, sets up training and validation datasets via manifest files, and runs a PyTorch Lightning trainer with configurable hyperparameters and experiment logging (including Weights & Biases).", "business_intent": "Allow organizations to improve speech recognition accuracy by exploiting abundant textual resources, reducing reliance on costly paired audio‑transcript data and enabling rapid domain adaptation of ASR systems.", "keywords": ["ASR", "TTS", "fine-tuning", "text-only data", "speech-to-text", "hybrid model", "NeMo", "Hydra", "experiment management", "manifest files", "learning rate", "batch size", "wandb logging"], "summary_hash": "3fc6ed3ec57b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:40:07+00:00"}
