{"summary": "The package supplies core graph-level mathematical primitives such as edge-wise softmax, gather‑then‑multiply, sparse‑dense‑dense multiplication, segment reductions and sparse matrix multiplication. Each primitive selects an appropriate backend implementation and works for both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, providing the building blocks needed by higher-level GNN models.", "business_intent": "To accelerate development and execution of graph neural networks by offering highly optimized, backend-agnostic operations that handle sparse and segmented data efficiently.", "keywords": ["DGL", "graph neural networks", "edge softmax", "gather matrix multiplication", "sparse-dense-dense multiplication", "segment reduction", "sparse matrix multiplication", "backend kernels", "heterogeneous graphs", "performance optimization"], "summary_hash": "b3119c54f11b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:59:18+00:00"}
