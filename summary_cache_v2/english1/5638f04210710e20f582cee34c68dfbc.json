{"summary": "Defines a flexible, parameterized quantum circuit class that builds two‑local (alternating single‑qubit rotation and multi‑qubit entanglement) layers. Users can choose rotation and entangling gate types, connectivity patterns or custom entangler maps, number of repetitions, barriers, and parameter naming, with automatic parameter generation and circuit assembly.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to quickly construct variational ansatz circuits for quantum algorithms such as VQE or QAOA, offering customizable gate structures and connectivity to explore different hardware topologies and optimization strategies.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "two-local", "variational ansatz", "parameterized gates", "rotation layer", "entanglement layer", "connectivity pattern", "Qiskit", "NLocal", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "e803a4ecc091", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:11:23+00:00"}
