{"summary": "The module implements a bidirectional interface between Qiskit QuantumCircuit objects and OpenQASM 2.0 programs. It offers functions to read QASM source from strings or files and construct circuits, as well as functions to write circuits back to QASM text or files. The API supports configurable include‑path handling, strict‑mode parsing, custom quantum instructions and classical functions, and provides compatibility helpers for legacy Qiskit behaviour. Dedicated error classes report parsing and export failures.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless interoperability between Qiskit and OpenQASM 2.0, allowing users to import existing QASM code into Qiskit workflows, export circuits for external tools, extend the language with custom gates and functions, and maintain compatibility with older Qiskit versions while handling errors gracefully.", "keywords": ["OpenQASM", "QASM2", "QuantumCircuit", "parsing", "exporting", "custom instructions", "custom classical functions", "include path", "strict mode", "legacy compatibility", "serialization", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "fc43582b677c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:57:13+00:00"}
