{"summary": "This module implements a stochastic differential equation (SDE) based sampler for diffusion generative models. It provides a scheduler that advances the diffusion process using DPMSolver techniques, supports multiple noise schedule types (beta, exponential, Karras, sigma‑based), and handles timestep scaling and step offsets. Auxiliary utilities generate Brownian motion trees and sample stochastic noise in a batched, configurable manner, and a lightweight container holds the results of each scheduler step.", "business_intent": "To offer a high‑performance, flexible SDE sampling engine that can be integrated into diffusion pipelines for faster and more accurate image generation, while allowing users to customize noise schedules and sampling strategies.", "keywords": ["diffusion models", "stochastic differential equation", "DPMSolver", "noise schedule", "Brownian motion", "torchsde", "sampling", "generative AI", "Karras schedule", "beta schedule"], "summary_hash": "850c67062cbc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:13:58+00:00"}
