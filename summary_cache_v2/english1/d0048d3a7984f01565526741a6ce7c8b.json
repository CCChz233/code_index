{"summary": "The module implements a lightweight, custom constraint‑satisfaction solver tailored for the CSPLayout transpiler pass. It wraps a recursive backtracking search, enforces a configurable cap on recursive calls, and exposes methods to obtain the found assignment and to track whether the call limit was reached.", "business_intent": "Enable bounded, deterministic solving of qubit‑placement constraints during quantum circuit transpilation, improving layout determination while preventing excessive recursion overhead.", "keywords": ["constraint satisfaction", "backtracking", "recursion limit", "quantum circuit layout", "transpiler", "Qiskit", "CSP solver", "custom solver", "mapping optimization", "resource control"], "summary_hash": "018c43b0741e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:29:01+00:00"}
