{"summary": "Implements a dummy transformation pass that sets and then reduces a specific property within a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The pass is non‑idempotent and does not declare any required or preserved properties, serving primarily as a simple example or test utility.", "business_intent": "Provide a lightweight, non‑idempotent DAG manipulation used for testing or illustrating how transformation passes can modify graph properties within a processing pipeline.", "keywords": ["transformation pass", "DAG", "property reduction", "non-idempotent", "dummy", "testing utility", "graph modification"], "summary_hash": "9169c0aa9108", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:31:03+00:00"}
