{"summary": "The script demonstrates how to apply the Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC) model to the Reddit node classification dataset using DGL and PyTorch. It loads and preprocesses the graph, constructs an SGConv layer, runs a training loop with optional early stopping, and reports evaluation metrics via a command‑line interface.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example that showcases large‑scale graph neural network training with SGC, helping developers and researchers benchmark and adopt graph learning techniques in production or research pipelines.", "keywords": ["graph neural networks", "Simplified Graph Convolution", "SGC", "DGL", "PyTorch", "Reddit dataset", "node classification", "graph convolution", "machine learning", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "256837c50dd8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:14:13+00:00"}
