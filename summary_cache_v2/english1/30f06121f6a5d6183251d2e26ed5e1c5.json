{"summary": "A reference implementation of the SwiGLU activation that expands the operation into its constituent steps, offering explicit forward and backward computations including a SiLU gradient helper. It is designed for clarity and profiling rather than speed, illustrating the overhead compared to fused kernels in standard deep‑learning libraries.", "business_intent": "To serve as a benchmark and educational tool for developers and researchers evaluating activation function performance in large transformer models, enabling detailed measurement and comparison with optimized library implementations.", "keywords": ["SwiGLU", "activation function", "decomposed implementation", "forward computation", "backward computation", "gradient helper", "benchmarking", "transformer", "ViT", "GPU performance"], "summary_hash": "513c231515c3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:17:24+00:00"}
