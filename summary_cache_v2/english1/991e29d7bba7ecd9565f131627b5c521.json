{"summary": "The module provides a set of utilities and a model implementation for Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) using TensorFlow. It includes a foundational model class that assembles input, hidden, and output graph convolution layers and defines the forward propagation logic. Additionally, it offers helper functions for preparing relational graph data for link prediction tasks, such as constructing graphs from triplets, normalizing node degrees, extracting adjacency matrices, and performing various edge and negative sampling techniques.", "business_intent": "To enable developers and researchers to efficiently build and train RGCN models for link prediction on relational data, facilitating experimentation and benchmarking in graph neural network research.", "keywords": ["RGCN", "TensorFlow", "link prediction", "graph neural networks", "data preparation", "negative sampling"], "summary_hash": "7d8d765dc863", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:51:00+00:00"}
