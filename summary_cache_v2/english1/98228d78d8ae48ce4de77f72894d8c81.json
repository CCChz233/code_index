{"summary": "A transpiler pass that refines the qubit layout of a fully transpiled quantum circuit. It removes idle wires, searches the device coupling graph for a subgraph with lower error using the VF2++ subgraph‑isomorphism algorithm, and updates the circuit to use the new qubit mapping, recording the result and stop reason in the property set.", "business_intent": "Automatically improve the execution fidelity of quantum circuits by finding a lower‑error qubit placement after transpilation.", "keywords": ["layout optimization", "post‑layout", "subgraph isomorphism", "VF2++", "error map", "coupling graph", "quantum transpiler", "circuit fidelity", "idle wire removal", "qubit mapping"], "summary_hash": "3a6013227c0a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:49:13+00:00"}
