{"summary": "A configurable variational autoencoder that transforms images into a compact latent representation using KL divergence regularization and reconstructs images from those latents, with support for customizable channel dimensions, block structures, scaling of latent values, and optional high‑precision upcasting for large‑resolution pipelines.", "business_intent": "Serves as the foundational encoder/decoder component in latent diffusion workflows, enabling efficient latent space manipulation for high‑resolution image synthesis and facilitating training and inference of diffusion‑based generative models.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "KL loss", "latent encoding", "image reconstruction", "diffusion models", "attention processing", "gradient checkpointing", "scaling factor", "high‑resolution", "precision upcasting"], "summary_hash": "4ec75615d7c9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:34:50+00:00"}
