{"summary": "Provides a descriptor that supplies a thread‑local dictionary shared among all instances of a class within the same thread, while keeping separate dictionaries for different threads. The descriptor forwards attribute access to an underlying storage dict and requires in‑place modifications to avoid replacing the descriptor itself.", "business_intent": "Facilitate safe, per‑thread shared state for classes used in multithreaded PyTorch/XLA PJRT environments, such as TPU v2/v3 workloads, ensuring each thread sees a consistent dictionary without interfering with other threads.", "keywords": ["descriptor", "thread‑local", "shared dictionary", "per‑thread storage", "PyTorch XLA", "PJRT", "multithreading", "TPU", "in‑place modification"], "summary_hash": "2b04131e3399", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:08:15+00:00"}
