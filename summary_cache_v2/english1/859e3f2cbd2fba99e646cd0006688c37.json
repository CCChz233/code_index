{"summary": "Implements a variational autoencoder with KL‑regularized latent space, configurable for 1‑D, 2‑D, or 3‑D inputs. It builds encoder and decoder stacks with residual blocks, group normalization, optional non‑local and flash attention, and supports memory‑efficient checkpointing and ConvTranspose up‑sampling.", "business_intent": "Serve as a flexible encoder‑decoder component for latent diffusion models, enabling compact latent representations and high‑quality reconstruction in image synthesis and medical imaging generation workflows.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "KL regularization", "latent diffusion", "residual blocks", "attention", "non‑local attention", "flash attention", "checkpointing", "ConvTranspose", "group normalization", "high‑resolution synthesis", "brain imaging"], "summary_hash": "1cb2570b47f0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:41:42+00:00"}
