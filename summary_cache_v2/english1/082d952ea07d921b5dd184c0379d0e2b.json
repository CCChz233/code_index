{"summary": "Provides the core building blocks for latent diffusion based text‑to‑image generation in NeMo, including encoder/decoder autoencoders (standard, KL‑regularized, vector‑quantized, identity) and the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (base diffusion, latent diffusion, and a Megatron‑scaled variant). The module handles latent encoding, conditioned diffusion, loss computation, iterative sampling, optimizer configuration, checkpoint management, logging, and large‑scale model parallelism.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to train, fine‑tune, and deploy stable diffusion models for converting textual prompts into high‑quality images, supporting both standard and large‑scale parallel training scenarios.", "keywords": ["latent diffusion", "autoencoder", "KL regularization", "vector quantization", "denoising diffusion probabilistic model", "text-to-image", "stable diffusion", "checkpointing", "training loop", "inference", "Megatron", "model parallelism", "schedule management", "logging", "image conversion"], "summary_hash": "9457f88aa7e9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:06:06+00:00"}
