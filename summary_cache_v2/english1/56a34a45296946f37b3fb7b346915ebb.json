{"summary": "The module defines a set of utilities for evaluating executable code generated by models, including loading ground‑truth data, matching output patterns, and performing various checking strategies (simple, parallel, REST‑based). Although the functions are currently placeholders, the intended responsibility is to compare model outputs with expected results and report correctness.", "business_intent": "Provide a framework for automatically validating and scoring model‑generated executable programs against predefined ground‑truth answers, supporting different execution modes and integration with external evaluation services.", "keywords": ["evaluation", "executable", "checker", "ground truth", "pattern matching", "REST API", "parallel execution", "caching", "JSON", "requests"], "summary_hash": "f5246f320e55", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:41:05+00:00"}
