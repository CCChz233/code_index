{"summary": "A Keras layer that takes a list of tensors with identical shapes and returns a single tensor containing the element‑wise minimum of the inputs. The output retains the same shape as the inputs and can be used to merge parallel branches in a model.", "business_intent": "Enable neural‑network architectures to combine multiple feature streams by selecting the smallest value at each position, facilitating gating, attention, or other logic that relies on element‑wise comparison across inputs.", "keywords": ["elementwise minimum", "tensor merging", "Keras layer", "neural network", "multi‑input", "shape preservation", "functional API"], "summary_hash": "5e928e3b843a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:04:40+00:00"}
