{"summary": "The module implements a retrieval‑augmented diffusion system that combines image similarity search with Stable Diffusion generation. It provides utilities to extract CLIP embeddings, build and query a FAISS index, and a custom diffusion pipeline that conditions generation on retrieved images using CLIP features, handling preprocessing, model loading, and inference.", "business_intent": "To enhance generative AI capabilities by allowing users to guide image synthesis with relevant retrieved examples, improving relevance and control for applications such as content creation, design assistance, and research on retrieval‑augmented generative models.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "retrieval", "CLIP", "FAISS", "Stable Diffusion", "ONNXRuntime", "image generation", "similarity search", "vector index", "pipeline"], "summary_hash": "bc0f449ea9e8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:38:18+00:00"}
