{"summary": "A suite of unit tests that validate the dataset preparation utilities employed in customizing AI model training. The tests cover conversion of raw records into prompt‑completion pairs, handling of templated prompts, elimination of duplicate or irrelevant fields, generation of deterministic filenames, parsing logic, suggestion of hyperparameters, creation of train/validation splits, and the emission of appropriate warnings and validation errors to guarantee data quality.", "business_intent": "To ensure the reliability and correctness of the data preprocessing pipeline used for tailoring AI models, thereby supporting the delivery of high‑quality, well‑structured training datasets for customized model development.", "keywords": ["dataset preparation", "AI model customization", "prompt-completion conversion", "template handling", "duplicate removal", "filename generation", "parsing validation", "hyperparameter suggestion", "train-validation split", "data quality assurance", "unit testing"], "summary_hash": "dc8d43ea06ed", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:53:01+00:00"}
