{"summary": "The module defines a PyTorch Dataset that reads a tab‑separated file of parallel sentences across multiple languages, computes a shared embedding for the source‑language sentence using a supplied SentenceTransformer encoder, propagates that embedding to each translation, and provides sequence‑like access to each sentence together with its corresponding embedding for downstream multilingual training or evaluation.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient creation and training of multilingual sentence‑embedding models by supplying aligned sentence data with pre‑computed shared embeddings, thereby simplifying cross‑lingual similarity learning, retrieval, and evaluation pipelines.", "keywords": ["parallel sentences", "multilingual dataset", "sentence transformer", "embedding propagation", "tab‑separated file", "PyTorch Dataset", "cross‑lingual training", "InputExample"], "summary_hash": "28ee037f2d15", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:59:15+00:00"}
