{"summary": "This test module validates the health burden calculations of the simulation framework. It defines a simple disease class that can impose disability or death, provides helper utilities, and contains a suite of unit tests that check arithmetic of life years lost, DALY computations, disability aggregation, stacked calculations, cause registration, mapper generation, and the execution of a simulation run with dummy diseases.", "business_intent": "To verify that the health burden components correctly compute disability-adjusted life years, life years lost, and related metrics, and that they integrate properly with the simulation's disease and cause registration mechanisms.", "keywords": ["health burden", "DALY", "life years lost", "disability aggregation", "simulation testing", "dummy disease", "mapper", "cause registration", "unit tests"], "summary_hash": "39a92e0ec289", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:43:33+00:00"}
