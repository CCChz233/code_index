{"summary": "A test suite that verifies Lightning Fabric's training loops produce identical results to native PyTorch for a simple convolutional network, covering both single‑device and distributed (DDP) scenarios. It includes fixtures to reset CuDNN settings, utilities for deterministic execution, CUDA memory handling, and comparison of losses, model states, timing, and resource usage.", "business_intent": "Ensure that Lightning Fabric's implementation is functionally and performance‑equivalent to PyTorch's reference behavior, providing confidence to users that Fabric can be adopted without loss of correctness or efficiency in both single‑GPU and multi‑GPU environments.", "keywords": ["Lightning Fabric", "PyTorch", "parity testing", "DistributedDataParallel", "deterministic training", "CUDA memory", "model state dict", "training loop validation", "reproducibility", "unit tests"], "summary_hash": "9f08afc9a806", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:07:53+00:00"}
