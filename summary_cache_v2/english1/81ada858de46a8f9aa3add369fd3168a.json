{"summary": "The module runs performance benchmarks for the argsort operation on arrays of various data types, comparing a distributed array library against NumPy. It parses command‑line options, generates test data, measures execution time for each implementation, and optionally checks that the results match.", "business_intent": "To assess and compare the speed and correctness of a distributed data‑processing framework's sorting index functionality with a standard in‑memory library, informing decisions on scaling, optimization, and suitability for large‑scale analytics workloads.", "keywords": ["argsort", "benchmark", "performance", "distributed computing", "Arkouda", "NumPy", "sorting", "timing", "correctness verification"], "summary_hash": "fa1f83ffcc65", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:19:19+00:00"}
