{"summary": "The class evaluates the Coulomb collision frequencies for a single test particle interacting with a background plasma species. Given the test and field particle types, relative drift speed, background temperature, number density, and Coulomb logarithm, it computes the fundamental collision coefficients (momentum‑loss, energy‑loss, parallel and transverse diffusion) using the exact analytical formulas derived from the Fokker‑Planck treatment.", "business_intent": "Provide plasma‑physics applications with a ready‑to‑use tool for quantifying how fast a particle loses momentum and energy and diffuses due to binary Coulomb collisions in a specified plasma environment.", "keywords": ["Coulomb collision frequency", "plasma", "test particle", "field particle", "drift velocity", "temperature", "number density", "Coulomb logarithm", "momentum loss", "energy loss", "diffusion", "plasma formulary"], "summary_hash": "ed220f9d02b8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:52:56+00:00"}
