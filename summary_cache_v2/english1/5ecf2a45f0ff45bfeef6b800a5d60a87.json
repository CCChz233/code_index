{"summary": "The module implements a suite of utilities for offline speaker clustering, including an auto‑tuned spectral clustering method that determines the optimal number of speakers and binarization threshold from an affinity matrix, a generic spectral clustering pipeline that creates embeddings and applies k‑means, and a higher‑level speaker clustering class that orchestrates these steps for training and inference. It also provides numerous helper routines for constructing affinity graphs, computing Laplacians, eigen‑decompositions, scaling embeddings, and measuring similarity or distance between speaker representations.", "business_intent": "To enable accurate, fully offline speaker diarization within speech‑processing pipelines by automatically estimating speaker counts and grouping speaker embeddings into distinct clusters, thereby improving downstream transcription and speaker attribution without requiring online resources.", "keywords": ["speaker diarization", "spectral clustering", "auto‑tuned eigengap", "affinity matrix", "Laplacian", "eigen decomposition", "k‑means", "speaker embeddings", "offline processing", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "d0d7e47ffdff", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:12:22+00:00"}
