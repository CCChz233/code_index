{"summary": "The module defines an abstract task runner interface and concrete implementations that control how Prefect tasks are executed. It provides a base class handling task lifecycle and queuing, a sequential runner that processes tasks one after another, and a concurrent runner that offloads synchronous tasks to a thread pool and automatically switches to asynchronous execution when I/O blocking is detected, allowing flows to run tasks in parallel without user‑level concurrency code.", "business_intent": "To give Prefect users a configurable mechanism for managing task execution strategies—such as sequential, parallel, or distributed—so that flows can be run efficiently while abstracting away low‑level concurrency details.", "keywords": ["task execution", "concurrency", "parallelism", "sequential processing", "thread pool", "asynchronous flow", "Prefect", "flow configuration", "execution management", "I/O blocking handling"], "summary_hash": "56404fd40839", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:24:43+00:00"}
