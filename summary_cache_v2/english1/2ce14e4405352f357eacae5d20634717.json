{"summary": "This module implements utilities for constructing numerical sequences and N‑dimensional coordinate grids on GPU arrays. The core component is a grid generator class that returns mesh arrays with options for dense or sparse layouts and correctly handles complex step specifications. Additional placeholder functions for common range creators (uniform, logarithmic, etc.) are present but not actively used.", "business_intent": "Provide high‑performance array creation tools that mirror NumPy's range and meshgrid capabilities, enabling scientific and engineering applications to generate coordinate matrices and sequences directly on the GPU for accelerated computation.", "keywords": ["array creation", "range generation", "coordinate grid", "dense grid", "sparse grid", "GPU acceleration", "CuPy", "mesh generation", "numerical sequences"], "summary_hash": "6c3df597d412", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:18:58+00:00"}
