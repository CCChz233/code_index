{"summary": "The assembler package translates high‑level quantum circuits and pulse schedules into the Qobj job format required by quantum backends, and can also reconstruct the original objects from a Qobj. It manages experiment configuration, calibration data, run settings, and supports optional parallel processing and validation of measurement mappings.", "business_intent": "Enable users to prepare, submit, and retrieve quantum jobs by providing a reliable conversion layer between user‑friendly quantum program representations and the low‑level serialized format understood by quantum hardware and simulators, while handling execution parameters and calibration information.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "pulse schedule", "Qobj", "backend execution", "serialization", "disassembly", "run configuration", "calibration data", "parallel processing", "measurement map validation"], "summary_hash": "e3c901ef9946", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:03:36+00:00"}
