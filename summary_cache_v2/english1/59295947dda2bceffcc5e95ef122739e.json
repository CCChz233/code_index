{"summary": "Provides a gRPC‑based translation service powered by NVIDIA NeMo NMT models, along with command‑line clients for direct text translation and for a combined speech‑to‑text‑to‑translation workflow. The server loads specified models, handles batching and inference, while the clients construct protobuf requests, stream audio to an ASR service, and display translated results.", "business_intent": "Allow enterprises and developers to expose high‑quality neural machine translation capabilities as a network service that can be easily integrated into multilingual applications, including real‑time speech translation pipelines.", "keywords": ["gRPC", "NeMo", "neural machine translation", "translation service", "ASR integration", "speech translation", "command‑line client", "model loading", "batch inference", "protobuf"], "summary_hash": "9a65afb69074", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:52:20+00:00"}
