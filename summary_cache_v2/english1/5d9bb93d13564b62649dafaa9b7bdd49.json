{"summary": "Implements a RMSNorm layer that normalizes inputs using their root‑mean‑square value, with optional bias and addition support. Includes optional Triton‑accelerated kernels for faster computation, though the standalone functions are currently unused placeholders.", "business_intent": "Provide an efficient, stable normalization primitive for transformer architectures to improve model convergence and performance, especially when leveraging GPU‑accelerated kernels.", "keywords": ["RMSNorm", "normalization", "root mean square", "transformer", "PyTorch", "Triton", "GPU acceleration", "layer"], "summary_hash": "a1fc8fd3fd03", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:29:54+00:00"}
