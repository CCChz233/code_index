{"summary": "This module provides a Google Cloud Storage backend for Metaflow. It defines a storage class that implements the standard datastore interface, handling configuration lookup, metadata queries, existence checks, directory listings, and binary read/write operations. It also includes a picklable wrapper around GCS clients that anchors all blob interactions to a configured datastore root, facilitating serialization for parallel execution.", "business_intent": "Allow Metaflow pipelines to persist and retrieve workflow artifacts, logs, and other data in Google Cloud Storage in a reliable, configurable, and parallel‑execution‑friendly manner.", "keywords": ["Google Cloud Storage", "Metaflow", "datastore backend", "artifact storage", "binary I/O", "configuration management", "parallel execution", "picklable client", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "bccbd9062cfa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:12:11+00:00"}
