{"summary": "This module defines automated tests for the Flux diffusion pipeline, including quick unit tests with lightweight dummy components to verify prompt processing, embedding creation, and QKV projection behavior, as well as a comprehensive slow test that runs the full pipeline on a GPU to validate inference results and model integration.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and stability of the Flux pipeline implementation, detect regressions early, and confirm that the model performs as expected in production environments for image generation tasks.", "keywords": ["Flux pipeline", "unit testing", "integration testing", "dummy components", "prompt handling", "embedding generation", "QKV fusion", "inference validation", "GPU requirements", "diffusers", "torch"], "summary_hash": "329c95a3fa73", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:50:19+00:00"}
