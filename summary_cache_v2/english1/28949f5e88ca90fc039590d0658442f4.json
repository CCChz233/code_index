{"summary": "The module implements a fast unit‑test suite for the Kandinsky V2.2 prior embedding‑to‑embedding pipeline. It builds lightweight dummy components and inputs, then verifies key behaviours such as attention slicing, consistency between batch and single inference, and correct transformation of embeddings.", "business_intent": "Provide automated verification to ensure that the Kandinsky prior embedding pipeline functions correctly after code changes, preventing regressions and supporting stable releases for developers and downstream users.", "keywords": ["Kandinsky V2.2", "prior pipeline", "embedding-to-embedding", "unit tests", "fast tests", "attention slicing", "batch inference", "deterministic", "diffusers", "transformers", "CLIP", "torch"], "summary_hash": "8103c2ce3961", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:55:49+00:00"}
