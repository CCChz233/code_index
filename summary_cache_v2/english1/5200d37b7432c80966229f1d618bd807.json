{"summary": "The module implements a metric for measuring the average surface distance between predicted and reference segmentation masks. It supports multi‑class and multi‑label inputs, optional exclusion of background, symmetric or asymmetric calculations, different distance definitions, and configurable reduction of per‑sample results.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable quantitative assessment of segmentation quality in medical imaging workflows, enabling model developers and researchers to evaluate and compare the geometric accuracy of predicted structures against ground truth annotations.", "keywords": ["surface distance", "segmentation evaluation", "average surface distance", "medical imaging", "multi‑class metric", "background exclusion", "symmetric distance", "metric reduction", "MONAI", "model validation"], "summary_hash": "3fc08f47b7b4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:12:32+00:00"}
