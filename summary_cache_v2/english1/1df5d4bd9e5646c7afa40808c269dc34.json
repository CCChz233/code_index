{"summary": "A comprehensive test suite for the IMOD water‑quality (wq) package, containing unit tests for each model component such as advection schemes, basic flow, transport, boundary conditions, discretization, drainage, dispersion, evapotranspiration, layer properties, mass loading, model assembly, output control, package groups, recharge, river, solver, time‑varying concentrations, variable density flow, and wells. The tests verify that each component correctly renders its input data (arrays, scalars, constants) into the expected IMOD file structures, handles stress‑period repetitions, time dimensions, and error conditions.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and robustness of the water‑quality modeling components in the IMOD framework, ensuring they produce properly formatted input files and behave as expected across various configurations, which supports reliable groundwater and water‑quality simulations for engineering and environmental analysis.", "keywords": ["IMOD", "water quality", "unit tests", "model rendering", "discretization", "stress periods", "boundary conditions", "transport", "solver", "hydrogeology", "simulation validation"], "summary_hash": "62677b44023d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:05:32+00:00"}
