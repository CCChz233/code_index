{"summary": "The module defines integration tests for MONAI's spatial transformer functionality. It includes a benchmark model that applies affine spatial transformations within a PyTorch workflow and a test suite that sets up synthetic 2‑D data, runs a training loop on the transformer core, and verifies the results, using deterministic settings for reproducibility.", "business_intent": "Validate and guarantee the correctness and trainability of the spatial transformer component used in medical imaging pipelines, providing a reference benchmark and automated regression testing to ensure reliable deployment in production systems.", "keywords": ["spatial transformer", "STN", "integration test", "PyTorch", "MONAI", "affine transform", "benchmark model", "training validation", "2D image", "deterministic", "unit testing"], "summary_hash": "ce091811fe1c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:48:25+00:00"}
