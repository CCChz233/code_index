{"summary": "The module defines core data structures for constructing and handling finite automata—both nondeterministic (NFA) and deterministic (DFA)—used in lexical analysis. It provides a machine container to manage states, utilities to create and link nodes, and mechanisms to serialize the automaton structure, with support for transition maps, acceptance actions, and priority handling.", "business_intent": "To support the creation and manipulation of state machines that drive token recognition in compilers, interpreters, or any system requiring fast pattern matching through lexical analysis.", "keywords": ["lexical analyzer", "finite automaton", "NFA", "DFA", "state machine", "tokenization", "transition map", "priority handling", "compiler", "parser", "serialization"], "summary_hash": "a95ecc907328", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:28:56+00:00"}
