{"summary": "This module implements the core of Dask's array library, defining a parallel, chunked multi‑dimensional array type that mimics NumPy's API while deferring computation to a task graph. It provides utilities for constructing arrays from various sources, managing chunk metadata, handling broadcasting, concatenation, slicing, and blockwise operations, and includes mechanisms for warning about inefficient chunking.", "business_intent": "To enable scalable, out‑of‑core and distributed array computations for scientific and data‑analytics workloads, allowing users to work with arrays larger than memory using a familiar NumPy‑like interface while leveraging parallel execution across cores or clusters.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "lazy evaluation", "chunked computation", "parallel processing", "distributed computing", "NumPy compatibility", "task graph", "blockwise operations", "broadcasting", "concatenation", "performance warning"], "summary_hash": "1035865a3acd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:18:23+00:00"}
