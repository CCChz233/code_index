{"summary": "Class that models a three‑controlled NOT gate realized with relative‑phase simplifications, following the circuit construction from the referenced research. It provides a gate object that can be added to a quantum circuit through the appropriate circuit method.", "business_intent": "Offer a resource‑efficient version of a triple‑controlled operation for quantum algorithms, allowing reduced gate count and depth when the gate’s phase differences are irrelevant because it will be uncomputed later.", "keywords": ["quantum gate", "three‑controlled NOT", "relative phase", "Toffoli simplification", "Qiskit", "circuit synthesis", "multi‑controlled operation", "RC3X", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "4f3f01b4b7bc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:33:56+00:00"}
