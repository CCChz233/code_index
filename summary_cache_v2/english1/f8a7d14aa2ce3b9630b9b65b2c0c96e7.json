{"summary": "The module provides a suite of alignment utilities that reposition pulse instructions within a schedule. It supports arranging operations at uniform intervals, according to a user-defined time mapping, or by packing them as early as possible, as late as possible, or in a continuous sequential order across multiple channels.", "business_intent": "To give quantum programmers fine‑grained control over the temporal layout of pulse programs, enabling optimized hardware execution, reduced idle time, and consistent timing across experiments.", "keywords": ["pulse", "schedule", "alignment", "timing", "equispaced", "functional", "left‑align", "right‑align", "sequential", "quantum control", "instruction reallocation"], "summary_hash": "6232aaf13c74", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:04:22+00:00"}
