{"summary": "A configuration container that encapsulates all architectural hyperparameters for a ResNet vision model, such as input channels, embedding dimension, stage widths, layer depths, block type, activation function, down‑sampling flags, and selectable output stages. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate a ResNet model with the desired structure.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to conveniently specify and modify the structure of a ResNet model—whether using default ResNet‑50 settings or custom variants—so they can create, fine‑tune, or deploy vision models with precise control over architecture and output features.", "keywords": ["ResNet", "configuration", "model architecture", "hyperparameters", "vision", "pretrained config", "embedding size", "hidden sizes", "depths", "layer type", "activation", "downsampling", "output features", "backbone"], "summary_hash": "6234ea8e24e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:54:02+00:00"}
