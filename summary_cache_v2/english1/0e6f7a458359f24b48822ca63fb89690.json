{"summary": "The module offers three example command‑line scripts for NVIDIA NeMo audio‑to‑audio workflows: one evaluates model outputs against reference audio using quality metrics, another processes input audio through a loaded model (e.g., denoising or enhancement) and saves the results, and the third trains speech‑enhancement models with configurable architectures and training parameters.", "business_intent": "Provide ready‑to‑use reference implementations that help developers quickly assess, apply, and train speech enhancement models, accelerating product development and research in audio processing solutions.", "keywords": ["audio-to-audio", "evaluation", "processing", "speech enhancement", "NeMo", "Hydra", "PyTorch Lightning", "SDR", "ESTOI", "PESQ", "CLI", "GPU", "CPU", "manifest"], "summary_hash": "e5f33fde764b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:55:48+00:00"}
