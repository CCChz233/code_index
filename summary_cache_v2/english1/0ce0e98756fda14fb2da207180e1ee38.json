{"summary": "The module defines a circuit class that builds instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. It creates a quantum circuit with an initial Hadamard layer, a diagonal layer of T‑gate rotations parameterized by an interaction matrix, controlled‑phase gates derived from the matrix’s upper‑triangular entries, and a final Hadamard layer, allowing users to instantiate IQP circuits directly from any square interaction matrix.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use component for constructing IQP circuits within Qiskit, facilitating research, benchmarking, and algorithm development that rely on this class of quantum circuits.", "keywords": ["IQP", "instantaneous quantum polynomial", "quantum circuit", "Hadamard", "T gate", "controlled phase", "interaction matrix", "Qiskit", "circuit construction", "quantum benchmarking"], "summary_hash": "14a5b6c11df0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:08:57+00:00"}
