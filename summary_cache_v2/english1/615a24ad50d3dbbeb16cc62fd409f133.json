{"summary": "Implements a flexible spatial cropping operation that extracts a region of interest from N‑dimensional, channel‑first data. It accepts slice specifications, center‑size pairs, or start‑end coordinates, automatically adjusts when the requested size exceeds the source dimensions, and can operate lazily to defer actual data extraction.", "business_intent": "Enables preprocessing pipelines to isolate sub‑volumes or regions of interest from large volumetric datasets (e.g., medical imaging, 3D scans) for analysis, model training, or inference, while handling out‑of‑bounds requests and supporting efficient lazy execution.", "keywords": ["cropping", "region of interest", "ROI", "sub‑volume", "spatial", "ND data", "channel‑first", "lazy execution", "slice specification", "center size", "start end coordinates", "image preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "fbe70ff58e3a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:02:55+00:00"}
