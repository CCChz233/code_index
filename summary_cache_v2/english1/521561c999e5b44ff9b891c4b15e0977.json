{"summary": "The script merges a delta checkpoint into a base language model, producing a new target model by loading the base model, applying weight differences from the delta files, and saving the combined model. It supports standard and low‑memory modes and handles large files by splitting them when necessary.", "business_intent": "Provide a lightweight tool for updating pretrained models with fine‑tuned delta weights, allowing rapid distribution and deployment of customized LLMs without redistributing the full model.", "keywords": ["delta weights", "model merging", "Hugging Face", "PyTorch", "transformers", "low memory", "file splitting", "model conversion"], "summary_hash": "45e727917038", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:38:18+00:00"}
