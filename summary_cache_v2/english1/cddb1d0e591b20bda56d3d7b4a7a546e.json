{"summary": "The class models a two-qubit controlled square‑root‑X (C√X) gate, where the control qubit determines whether a √X operation is applied to the target qubit. It supplies the unitary matrix, circuit symbol, and integration with Qiskit circuits via the csx instruction.", "business_intent": "To give quantum programmers a ready‑to‑use, standard implementation of the controlled √X operation for building, simulating, and executing quantum algorithms that require this specific entangling gate.", "keywords": ["controlled sqrt X", "quantum gate", "two-qubit gate", "Qiskit", "unitary matrix", "quantum circuit"], "summary_hash": "10cdc8117d36", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:31:22+00:00"}
