{"summary": "The module defines dataset classes that download, preprocess, and construct DGL graphs for standard citation networks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed). It provides node features, label masks for training/validation/testing, and supports optional reverse edges, graph reordering, and user‑defined transforms. Helper utilities handle one‑hot encoding, feature normalization, and mask generation.", "business_intent": "Facilitate research and benchmarking of graph neural network models by offering ready‑to‑use citation graph datasets for node classification tasks.", "keywords": ["citation network", "graph dataset", "DGL", "node classification", "Cora", "Citeseer", "Pubmed", "preprocessing", "feature normalization", "train mask", "validation mask", "test mask", "reverse edges", "graph reordering", "transforms"], "summary_hash": "5c725ede3e7e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:59:14+00:00"}
