{"summary": "The script orchestrates the evaluation of a text classification model using model-parallel (distributed) execution. It loads configuration via Hydra, initializes the NeMo TextClassificationModel, applies a custom NLP distributed strategy, manages experiment logging and checkpoints, and runs the evaluation across multiple GPUs or nodes.", "business_intent": "Enable users to benchmark and validate large-scale text classification models in a distributed environment, simplifying the setup of model-parallel evaluation for research and production deployments.", "keywords": ["text classification", "model parallel", "evaluation", "distributed data parallel", "NeMo", "Hydra", "experiment manager", "logging", "NLP", "PyTorch Lightning"], "summary_hash": "099d58a4829d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:42:49+00:00"}
