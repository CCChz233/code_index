{"summary": "The module provides a comprehensive set of visitor and transformer utilities for walking, modifying, and resolving ambiguities in parse trees generated by the Lark parsing library. It defines base classes and concrete implementations for recursive, non‑recursive, and in‑place traversal, supports user‑defined callbacks, argument‑processing decorators, and transformer pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to efficiently process and transform parse trees—applying custom logic, handling ambiguous structures, and building transformation pipelines—without manual traversal code, thereby simplifying language processing and compiler‑like workflows.", "keywords": ["parse tree", "visitor pattern", "transformer", "in‑place transformation", "non‑recursive", "recursive", "ambiguity resolution", "pipeline", "callback", "Lark", "grammar", "tree manipulation", "decorator"], "summary_hash": "3fad02cc6cab", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:41:28+00:00"}
