{"summary": "A loss module that first applies a binary mask to both predictions and ground‑truth tensors, zeroing out un‑masked areas, and then computes the standard Dice loss on the masked region, ensuring that only the selected region influences the loss value and back‑propagated gradients.", "business_intent": "Enable focused training on specific regions (e.g., organs or lesions) in segmentation models, particularly in medical imaging or any task where loss should be limited to a predefined mask.", "keywords": ["Dice loss", "masking", "binary mask", "segmentation", "region‑specific loss", "gradient restriction", "custom loss function", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "d0c21f98e140", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:26:55+00:00"}
