{"summary": "Implements an image‑to‑image generation pipeline based on Stable Diffusion 3. It orchestrates a conditional transformer, a diffusion scheduler, a variational auto‑encoder, and three frozen text encoders (two CLIP variants and a T5 model) together with their tokenizers to encode prompts, prepare latent representations, apply classifier‑free guidance, and iteratively denoise latents into a final image.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and creators to produce high‑quality, text‑guided image transformations from existing pictures for applications such as artistic rendering, content creation, and visual prototyping.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "img2img", "diffusion pipeline", "transformer denoiser", "scheduler", "variational auto‑encoder", "CLIP encoder", "T5 encoder", "prompt embedding", "classifier‑free guidance", "latent preparation", "timesteps", "joint attention"], "summary_hash": "c0b85f4acfaa", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:17:38+00:00"}
