{"summary": "A comprehensive collection of unit tests that verify the correctness, performance, and constraint handling of quantum circuit synthesis utilities across a range of gate families (Clifford, CNOT, CZ, CX‑CZ, QFT, stabilizer, permutation, Weyl) and synthesis strategies (linear reversible, Gray‑Synth, Patel‑Markov‑Hayes, KMS, local invariants). The tests check functional equivalence, depth and linear‑nearest‑neighbor connectivity, invertibility, and proper handling of edge cases and invalid inputs.", "business_intent": "Provide automated validation to guarantee that the quantum synthesis library produces accurate, hardware‑compatible circuits, thereby supporting reliable development of quantum algorithms and ensuring confidence in the library's synthesis capabilities.", "keywords": ["quantum synthesis", "unit testing", "Clifford decomposition", "CNOT phase synthesis", "CZ synthesis", "linear reversible circuits", "LNN constraints", "stabilizer synthesis", "Quantum Fourier Transform", "permutation synthesis", "Weyl coordinates", "local invariants", "circuit depth", "connectivity"], "summary_hash": "7442046ee299", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:10:57+00:00"}
