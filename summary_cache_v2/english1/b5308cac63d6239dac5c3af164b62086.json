{"summary": "This module contains unit tests for the hybrid RNNT‑CTC speech recognition model using character‑level tokenization. It verifies model construction, training steps, validation, inference, and various decoding strategies (greedy, beam search, sampled joint) while handling optional NumPy/Numba optimizations.", "business_intent": "Validate the reliability and correctness of the hybrid RNNT‑CTC ASR model to ensure accurate speech‑to‑text conversion in production systems that depend on character‑based transcription.", "keywords": ["hybrid RNNT CTC", "speech recognition", "character tokenization", "unit testing", "NeMo", "PyTorch", "decoding strategies", "beam search", "greedy decoding", "numba optimization", "model validation"], "summary_hash": "79a7a732e3e7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:29:30+00:00"}
