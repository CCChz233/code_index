{"summary": "Implements a compact ControlNet (XS) variant that can be attached to UNet models for diffusion‑based image generation. The module supplies adapters for downsampling, mid, and upsampling blocks, cross‑attention layers, utility helpers, and a unified UNetControlNetXSModel that handles configuration, checkpointing, attention processor customization, and optional QKV projection fusion.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with an efficient, easy‑to‑integrate ControlNet solution for Stable Diffusion and SDXL pipelines, enabling controllable conditioning, fine‑tuning, and inference with reduced computational overhead.", "keywords": ["ControlNet XS", "UNet", "diffusion model", "Stable Diffusion", "cross attention", "adapter", "downsampling", "upsampling", "mid block", "model configuration", "gradient checkpointing", "parameter freezing", "QKV fusion", "freeU", "image generation"], "summary_hash": "7f6e5f3ddcf9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:31:09+00:00"}
