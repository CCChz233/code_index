{"summary": "The module implements a collection of pulse instruction classes for Qiskit Pulse, representing concrete hardware actions (play, acquire, delay, frequency shift, phase shift, snapshot) and compile‑time directives (barriers, timing constraints, references). These classes encapsulate duration, channel association, parameter validation, and timing manipulation, enabling the construction and introspection of quantum pulse schedules.", "business_intent": "Provide a comprehensive, object‑oriented API that lets developers build, modify, and compile precise quantum pulse programs, translating high‑level schedule specifications into hardware‑compatible instructions for quantum devices.", "keywords": ["quantum pulse", "instruction", "schedule", "play", "acquire", "delay", "frequency", "phase", "snapshot", "directive", "reference", "Qiskit", "backend", "waveform", "channel", "compiler"], "summary_hash": "86f24283a81f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:05:57+00:00"}
