{"summary": "Provides a TestsetGenerator class that orchestrates the creation of synthetic evaluation datasets for retrieval‑augmented generation pipelines. It combines language model prompting, embedding similarity, optional knowledge‑graph enrichment, and document source handling (e.g., LangChain or LlamaIndex) while applying configurable transforms and tracking generation analytics.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and data scientists to automatically produce realistic test cases for assessing RAG system performance, reducing manual effort in building benchmark datasets.", "keywords": ["synthetic testset", "RAG evaluation", "language model generation", "embedding similarity", "knowledge graph", "document source integration", "LangChain", "LlamaIndex", "analytics tracking", "data transforms"], "summary_hash": "963b7ce869fc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:51:16+00:00"}
