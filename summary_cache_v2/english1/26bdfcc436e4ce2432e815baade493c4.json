It includes utilities for treating TAR archives as virtual file systems, enabling read‑only access to files and directories within a TAR, and a storage adapter that maps archive contents to Zarr-compatible storage, facilitating direct access to Zarr arrays and metadata from archives or filesystem paths. It also offers a helper to extract TAR archives. Additionally, it implements a TensorRTLLM exporter that converts NeMo language‑model checkpoints into TensorRT‑LLM artifacts, builds optimized inference engines, supports prompt‑tuning tables, and enables low‑latency inference, optionally via Triton server.\n\nBusiness intent: Provide efficient model export and deployment pipelines for NeMo language models, allowing users to package model data in TAR archives and serve them with high‑performance TensorRT inference, reducing latency and simplifying integration with serving infrastructures.\n\nKeywords: [\"TAR archive virtual filesystem\", \"Zarr storage adapter\", \"model export\", \"TensorRT-LLM conversion\", \"low-latency inference\", \"prompt tuning\", \"Triton server integration\", \"NeMo language models\"].\n\nMake JSON.\n\nNeed to ensure no markdown.
