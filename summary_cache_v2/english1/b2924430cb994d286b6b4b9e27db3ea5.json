{"summary": "The module supplies core utilities for managing multimodal dialogues and preparing training data for multimodal language models. It includes a conversation handler that aggregates, deduplicates, serializes, and formats text and media exchanges for prompts and UI components, and a dataset toolkit that lazily reads images and videos from archives or directories, preprocesses visual inputs, tokenizes textual prompts, and assembles padded batches for supervised fine‑tuning.", "business_intent": "To streamline the development and fine‑tuning of multimodal AI systems by providing ready‑to‑use conversation handling and data loading pipelines, reducing engineering effort for researchers and product teams building chat‑based or instruction‑following multimodal models.", "keywords": ["multimodal", "conversation management", "dataset loading", "fine‑tuning", "image preprocessing", "video preprocessing", "lazy loading", "prompt construction", "batch collation", "Gradio integration"], "summary_hash": "d9660a246fa2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:04:40+00:00"}
