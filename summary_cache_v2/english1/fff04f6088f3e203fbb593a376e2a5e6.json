{"summary": "This module provides a suite of unit tests that validate the behavior of computational graph nodes within the CGP framework. It checks basic arithmetic operations, parameter handling, and the correct compilation of graphs to different execution backends such as NumPy, SymPy, and PyTorch, as well as proper error handling for malformed node definitions.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and correctness of node operations in the CGP library across multiple computational backends, supporting robust scientific and machine‑learning applications.", "keywords": ["CGP", "computational graph", "node", "unit test", "arithmetic", "parameter", "NumPy", "SymPy", "PyTorch", "backend compilation", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "57a9c9e390d1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:45:42+00:00"}
