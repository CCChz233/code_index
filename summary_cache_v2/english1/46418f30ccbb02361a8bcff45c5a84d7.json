{"summary": "An abstract base class that defines the common structure and behavior for all backend objects supplied by a provider. It encapsulates immutable configuration data, mutable runtime options, and optional dynamic properties such as version or noise characteristics. Subclasses are expected to implement the execution logic and default option handling.", "business_intent": "Provide a uniform interface for providers to expose backends, allowing users to configure, query, and execute quantum experiments while abstracting provider-specific details.", "keywords": ["backend", "abstract", "configuration", "runtime options", "dynamic properties", "provider", "quantum execution", "status", "interface", "immutability"], "summary_hash": "cd5ac8c08846", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:08:40+00:00"}
