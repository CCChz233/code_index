{"summary": "This module implements a flexible registry system for Ethereum ABI encoding and decoding handlers. It defines core classes for managing collections of coders, predicate‑based lookups, equality checks, and copy support, along with utilities for cache clearing and type analysis.", "business_intent": "Enable dynamic registration, retrieval, verification and removal of ABI coders based on type predicates, facilitating accurate encoding/decoding of contract data in Ethereum applications.", "keywords": ["abi", "registry", "encoder", "decoder", "predicate", "mapping", "ethereum", "type handling", "registration", "copyable", "base registry", "equality", "caching"], "summary_hash": "bfff5a019d7a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:43:32+00:00"}
