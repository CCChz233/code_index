{"summary": "Implements a Lightning callback that creates and controls several console progress bars using tqdm for different stages of a model run—sanity check, training, validation, testing, and prediction. The bars are updated in response to trainer events, can be paused/resumed, and are configurable in terms of refresh frequency, line position, and whether they remain after completion. Users can subclass the callback to modify bar appearance or behavior.", "business_intent": "Provide clear, real‑time visual feedback on the progress of deep‑learning training and evaluation loops, improving user monitoring, debugging, and overall experience, while allowing developers to tailor the progress display to their needs.", "keywords": ["tqdm", "progress bar", "training monitoring", "validation tracking", "testing progress", "console output", "Lightning callback", "refresh rate", "customizable", "enable/disable"], "summary_hash": "0982b07b4d8d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:24:17+00:00"}
