{"summary": "The class provides a configurable loss computation based on the Maximum Likelihood principle, primarily implementing Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and allowing extensions to other sequence‑modeling loss types such as ASG, HMM, and RNNT. It prepares and intersects graph representations of target and prediction sequences, calculates scores, and returns the resulting loss value for model training.", "business_intent": "Enable training of sequence‑to‑sequence models—especially speech or language models—by supplying an efficient, extensible loss function that aligns predictions with variable‑length targets using CTC and related criteria.", "keywords": ["Maximum Likelihood", "CTC loss", "Connectionist Temporal Classification", "ASG", "HMM", "RNNT", "sequence alignment", "graph intersection", "score calculation", "configurable loss", "speech recognition", "training objective"], "summary_hash": "4ab85d5e8d89", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:25:19+00:00"}
