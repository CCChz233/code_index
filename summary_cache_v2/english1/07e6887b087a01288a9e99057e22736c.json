{"summary": "A collection of helper functions for processing raw measurement counts in quantum experiments, primarily to support readout error mitigation. The utilities convert counts to probability vectors, handle marginalization and qubit remapping, and provide basic statistical calculations such as expectation values and standard deviations.", "business_intent": "Facilitate accurate analysis of quantum measurement data by providing tools that prepare and transform counts for readout error mitigation, enabling more reliable estimation of quantum observables in quantum computing applications.", "keywords": ["readout mitigation", "measurement counts", "probability vector", "marginalization", "qubit remapping", "expectation value", "standard deviation", "quantum result processing", "utility functions"], "summary_hash": "75f1493b3876", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:01:52+00:00"}
