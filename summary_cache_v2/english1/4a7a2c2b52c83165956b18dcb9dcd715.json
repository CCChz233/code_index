{"summary": "The module offers a collection of utilities for visualizing medical imaging data and model outputs. It includes tools to generate animated GIFs from matplotlib frames, extract and optionally rescale intermediate feature maps via forward hooks, and manage iterative image writing. Helper functions provide label-to-RGB conversion, overlay of segmentation masks on images, and saving of images or feature maps, with optional integration for experiment tracking.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and clinicians to inspect, debug, and present deep learning model results on medical images by producing clear visual representations such as colored segmentations, feature map visualizations, and animated summaries.", "keywords": ["visualization", "medical imaging", "segmentation overlay", "feature map extraction", "animated GIF", "PyTorch hooks", "image saving", "color mapping", "experiment tracking"], "summary_hash": "e19accf15eff", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:29:40+00:00"}
