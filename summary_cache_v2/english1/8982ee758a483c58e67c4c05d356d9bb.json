{"summary": "This module provides CTC decoding functionality for automatic speech recognition models. It defines an abstract decoder interface and concrete implementations that transform CTC log‑probability tensors into readable text hypotheses using greedy or beam‑search methods. The decoders support optional timestamp extraction at character or word level, alignment and confidence preservation, configurable batch dimensions, and rely on a flexible configuration object and tokenizer.", "business_intent": "Convert raw CTC model outputs into accurate, timestamped, and confidence‑annotated transcriptions, facilitating integration of speech recognition capabilities into applications such as transcription services, voice assistants, and other speech‑driven products.", "keywords": ["CTC", "decoding", "beam search", "greedy decoding", "timestamps", "alignment", "confidence scores", "tokenizer", "ASR", "speech recognition", "batch processing"], "summary_hash": "f69757472d2f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:15:47+00:00"}
