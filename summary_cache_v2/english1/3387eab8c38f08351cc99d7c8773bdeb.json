{"summary": "The package supplies a framework for defining and managing Terraform module checks. It introduces an abstract base class that equips checks with utilities for recognizing Git‑based module sources, extracting module configurations, and loading module definitions from Terraform code, while integrating with a module registry. Additionally, it implements a central registry that handles registration, lookup, and metadata storage for all module check entities.", "business_intent": "To provide a reusable, extensible mechanism for automatically validating Terraform modules against security, compliance, and best‑practice rules, enabling consistent enforcement across infrastructure‑as‑code projects.", "keywords": ["Terraform", "module checks", "registry", "IaC validation", "compliance", "security", "abstract base class", "Git source detection", "configuration extraction"], "summary_hash": "74115fb278dc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:19:46+00:00"}
