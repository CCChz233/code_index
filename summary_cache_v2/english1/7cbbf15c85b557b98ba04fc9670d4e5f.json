{"summary": "A configuration container for the SwiftFormer vision transformer model that encapsulates all architectural hyper‑parameters such as input channels, stage depths, embedding dimensions, MLP ratio, down‑sampling flags and sizes, activation type, dropout rates, layer‑scale settings, and batch‑norm epsilon. It inherits from the generic PretrainedConfig, allowing seamless integration with the Transformers library and enabling model instantiation that mirrors the reference swiftformer‑xs architecture when defaults are used.", "business_intent": "Provide developers a simple, reproducible way to define and tweak the SwiftFormer model architecture for computer‑vision tasks, ensuring consistent model creation, easy parameter tuning, and compatibility with the Transformers ecosystem.", "keywords": ["SwiftFormer", "configuration", "model architecture", "vision transformer", "hyperparameters", "embedding dimensions", "downsampling", "activation function", "dropout", "layer scaling", "batch normalization", "PretrainedConfig"], "summary_hash": "3d6bd45454cb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:06:43+00:00"}
