{"summary": "This module defines a Mel class that encapsulates the creation, manipulation, and optional visualization of mel‑spectrogram representations for audio data within a deprecated audio diffusion pipeline. It provides configuration handling, conversion between waveforms and mel spectrograms, normalization utilities, and integrates with the library's scheduling infrastructure.", "business_intent": "Support audio diffusion models by offering a reusable component for mel‑spectrogram processing, enabling developers to prepare audio inputs and interpret model outputs for tasks such as speech synthesis, music generation, and audio enhancement.", "keywords": ["mel spectrogram", "audio diffusion", "waveform conversion", "normalization", "configuration", "scheduler", "numpy", "visualization", "PIL"], "summary_hash": "d736373cf439", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:28:18+00:00"}
