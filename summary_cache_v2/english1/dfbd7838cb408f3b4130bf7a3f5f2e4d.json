{"summary": "The package supplies tools for defining and calibrating simulation scenarios used in maternal and perinatal health analyses. It includes a baseline scenario that assembles health, demographic, and disease modules with logging support, as well as a calibration helper that prepares configuration settings, generates parameter draw sets, and exposes the required disease and health‑system modules for model execution.", "business_intent": "Enable public‑health researchers and analysts to efficiently set up, run, and calibrate maternal‑perinatal outcome models, facilitating reproducible simulations and systematic exploration of health interventions.", "keywords": ["maternal health", "perinatal outcomes", "simulation scenario", "calibration", "parameter draws", "health modules", "disease modules", "model configuration", "logging"], "summary_hash": "989aa7aa96b3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:05:56+00:00"}
