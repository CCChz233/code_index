{"summary": "Implements a multi‑dimensional attention gate used in the decoder of an Attention U‑Net. It receives feature maps and a gating signal, computes attention coefficients via learned convolutions (theta, phi, psi) and a linear transformation (W), optionally subsamples and upsamples, and multiplies the coefficients with the input features to emphasize salient regions before they are merged in the decoder.", "business_intent": "Enhance the precision of image segmentation models—especially in medical imaging—by automatically focusing on the most relevant spatial features, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing computational waste.", "keywords": ["attention gate", "U-Net decoder", "feature weighting", "2D/3D convolution", "medical image segmentation", "gating mechanism", "spatial attention"], "summary_hash": "7c2d83d1d0bb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:27:02+00:00"}
