{"summary": "This module implements utilities for inter‑process communication of PyTorch tensors, especially GPU tensors. It provides a lightweight wrapper around a multiprocessing pipe to send and receive messages, along with helpers to serialize and deserialize CUDA tensors and to exchange memory addresses between processes, as well as an initialization routine for setting up IPC.", "business_intent": "Facilitate efficient sharing of GPU tensor data across multiple processes to support distributed training or parallel inference workloads, minimizing data copying and synchronization overhead.", "keywords": ["inter-process communication", "CUDA tensor sharing", "PyTorch", "multiprocessing pipe", "GPU memory serialization", "distributed training", "parallel computation"], "summary_hash": "9586bd4acb9a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:29:20+00:00"}
