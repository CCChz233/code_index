{"summary": "The module offers utilities for interacting with TAR archives as virtual file systems. It defines a path‑like object that enables read‑only navigation of files and directories inside a TAR file, and a storage adapter that presents archive contents as a mapping compatible with the Zarr library, allowing Zarr arrays and metadata to be accessed directly from TAR or regular filesystem paths. Additionally, it provides a helper to extract a TAR archive to a target location.", "business_intent": "Facilitate efficient loading and handling of archived datasets, especially Zarr‑formatted data, within the NeMo ecosystem without needing to fully extract archives, thereby simplifying data management and improving I/O performance.", "keywords": ["tar archive", "virtual filesystem", "path navigation", "read‑only access", "Zarr integration", "storage mapping", "data extraction", "NeMo", "archive handling"], "summary_hash": "3ebf7e8800f5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:49:44+00:00"}
