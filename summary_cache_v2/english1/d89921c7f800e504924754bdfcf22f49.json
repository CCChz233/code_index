{"summary": "The module supplies tensorized PyTorch layers that enable differentiable hierarchical pooling for graph neural networks. It includes a batched GraphSAGE encoder for node embedding, a soft assignment layer that computes node‑to‑cluster probabilities, and a DiffPool layer that integrates these components while providing auxiliary entropy and link‑prediction losses, all optimized for mini‑batch processing.", "business_intent": "To provide a ready‑to‑use, efficient implementation of hierarchical graph pooling that can be incorporated into PyTorch models for tasks such as molecular property prediction, social network analysis, or any application requiring scalable graph representation learning.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "DiffPool", "Graph Neural Network", "GraphSAGE", "differentiable pooling", "soft assignment", "hierarchical representation", "batched processing", "tensorized layers", "auxiliary loss"], "summary_hash": "470c13c025e7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:57:58+00:00"}
