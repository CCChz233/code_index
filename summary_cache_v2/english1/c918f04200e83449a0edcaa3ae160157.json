{"summary": "The module defines a collection of dataset classes and utilities for text‑to‑speech (TTS) training. It loads audio files, extracts acoustic features such as mel‑spectrograms, pitch, energy, and alignment information, applies tokenization for various TTS architectures, handles speaker metadata, and provides collate functions that pad and batch data. It also includes a length‑aware bucket sampler for distributed training, ensuring each batch contains samples of similar duration.", "business_intent": "To streamline the preparation of large speech corpora for neural TTS model development, enabling efficient data loading, preprocessing, and batching so that researchers and product teams can train high‑quality speech synthesis systems at scale.", "keywords": ["text-to-speech", "dataset", "audio loading", "mel spectrogram", "pitch extraction", "energy features", "tokenization", "speaker identification", "padding", "collate", "bucket sampler", "distributed training", "FastPitch", "Mixer TTS", "self‑supervised learning", "alignment matrix", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "46b0f897eb6c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:55:48+00:00"}
