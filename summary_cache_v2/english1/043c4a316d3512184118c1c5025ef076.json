{"summary": "The module implements a collection of dictionary-based transforms for MRI reconstruction workflows. These transforms operate on data dictionaries to apply equispaced or random k‑space under‑sampling masks, relocate metadata entries, normalize image intensities using a reference image, and spatially crop images to match a reference size, with support for complex‑valued data and configurable key selection.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible, key‑driven preprocessing of MRI reconstruction datasets within the MONAI framework, streamlining tasks such as under‑sampling simulation, metadata management, intensity scaling, and spatial alignment to improve downstream reconstruction model training and evaluation.", "keywords": ["MRI reconstruction", "dictionary transform", "k-space under-sampling", "equispaced mask", "random mask", "intensity normalization", "reference image", "spatial cropping", "metadata handling", "complex data", "MONAI preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "5d1fe2edd051", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:27:36+00:00"}
