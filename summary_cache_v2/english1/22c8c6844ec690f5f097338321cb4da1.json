{"summary": "The class encapsulates a point‑spread‑function (PSF) image built from photon impact coordinates. It loads photon data from simulation files, validates positions, computes centroids, derives PSF metrics and effective collection area (given a scatter area), maintains cumulative and image representations, scans radii for encircled‑energy analysis, and visualises the distribution as a 2‑D histogram.", "business_intent": "Provide telescope designers and astrophysics researchers with a reusable tool to quantify and visualise the imaging performance of optical systems using simulated photon data, facilitating assessment of PSF quality and effective area.", "keywords": ["photon positions", "point spread function", "centroid calculation", "effective area", "encircled energy", "radius scanning", "2D histogram", "telescope simulation", "optical performance analysis", "visualisation"], "summary_hash": "ac043cce86de", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:48:54+00:00"}
