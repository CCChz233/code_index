{"summary": "A test suite that validates the integration of TPU (XLA) support within the Lightning training framework. It defines lightweight model helpers and runs a variety of checks on device selection, data loader handling, precision settings, multi‑device configurations, gradient clipping, gradient norm computation, early stopping, synchronization, debug mode, and proper error handling when TPUs are unavailable or misconfigured.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the Lightning library works correctly on TPU hardware, preventing regressions and ensuring that all TPU‑related features behave as expected across different training scenarios.", "keywords": ["TPU", "XLA", "Lightning", "Trainer", "accelerator", "device selection", "data loader", "16-bit precision", "multi‑device", "gradient clipping", "gradient norm", "early stopping", "synchronization", "debug mode", "misconfiguration", "tests"], "summary_hash": "8fe1017490f4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:40:57+00:00"}
