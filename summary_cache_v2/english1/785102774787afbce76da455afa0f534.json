{"summary": "A comprehensive collection of unit tests for the quantum channel module, validating construction, arithmetic, composition, tensor products, adjoint and conjugate operations, and conversion among all supported channel representations (Chi, Choi, Kraus, PTM, Stinespring, Superoperator). The tests also verify physical properties such as complete positivity and trace preservation, and ensure consistent evolution across representations.", "business_intent": "Ensure the correctness and reliability of quantum channel implementations used in quantum computing simulations, supporting robust development, maintenance, and future extensions of the quantum information library.", "keywords": ["quantum channel", "unit tests", "Qiskit", "Chi matrix", "Choi matrix", "Kraus operators", "Pauli Transfer Matrix", "PTM", "Stinespring dilation", "Superoperator", "CPTP", "complete positivity", "trace preservation", "representation conversion", "composition", "tensor product", "verification"], "summary_hash": "d8c846af58a5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:13:11+00:00"}
