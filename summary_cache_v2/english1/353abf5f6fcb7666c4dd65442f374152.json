{"summary": "A unit‑test suite dedicated to validating the ConvNextV2 model implementation. It checks that the model can be instantiated from its configuration, handles image‑classification inputs, produces correct hidden‑state outputs, supports common model attributes, can be loaded from pretrained weights, and functions correctly during training, including gradient‑checkpointing, while accounting for the fact that ConvNextV2 does not use typical NLP inputs such as input IDs or attention masks.", "business_intent": "Ensure the ConvNextV2 architecture works reliably for image classification scenarios by automatically testing its configuration, forward pass, hidden‑state generation, training dynamics, and pretrained loading, thereby guaranteeing model quality and stability before deployment.", "keywords": ["ConvNextV2", "model testing", "unit tests", "image classification", "configuration validation", "hidden states", "training", "gradient checkpointing", "pretrained model", "inputs_embeds"], "summary_hash": "7c5cbed176f9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:43:38+00:00"}
