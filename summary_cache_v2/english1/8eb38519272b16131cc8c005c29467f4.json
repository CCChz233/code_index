{"summary": "This package implements the Bootstrap Graph Representation Learning (BGRL) framework using DGL and PyTorch. It includes a self‑supervised GNN trainer, model components (GCN, GraphSAGE‑GCN hybrid, predictor, momentum‑updated target encoder), data loaders and augmentation pipelines for standard graph benchmarks, a cosine‑decay scheduler, and utilities for fitting simple linear classifiers on the learned node embeddings to assess downstream performance such as node classification and link prediction.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run reference implementation that enables researchers and engineers to train BGRL‑based graph neural networks on popular datasets, reproduce reported results, and evaluate the quality of the learned representations for downstream tasks.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "self‑supervised learning", "bootstrap graph representation learning", "DGL", "PyTorch", "node classification", "link prediction", "graph augmentation", "momentum encoder", "benchmark datasets"], "summary_hash": "d833d2f47884", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:51:34+00:00"}
