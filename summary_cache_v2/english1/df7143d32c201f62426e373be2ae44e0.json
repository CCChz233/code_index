{"summary": "This module implements a generic metadata container used throughout MONAI to attach arbitrary information to data samples. The central class stores key‑value pairs, handles deep copying, respects immutability constraints, and manages a flag that determines whether transformation operations should be recorded. Helper utilities provide standardized access to this tracking flag.", "business_intent": "Enable consistent handling and propagation of auxiliary information (e.g., image spacing, orientation, preprocessing history) across medical imaging pipelines, facilitating reproducibility and auditability of data transformations.", "keywords": ["metadata", "tracking", "deep copy", "immutability", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "data container", "preprocessing history"], "summary_hash": "b1e65eb939f9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:12:16+00:00"}
