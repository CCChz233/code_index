{"summary": "This module implements a high‑level Python interface to ANSYS MAPDL's Krylov reduced‑order solver. It encapsulates the workflow of generating a Krylov subspace, solving a reduced harmonic problem across a frequency range, and reconstructing the full finite‑element solution, while performing validation, orthogonality checks, and residual error calculations.", "business_intent": "To provide engineers and analysts with a streamlined, efficient way to conduct large‑scale harmonic analyses using Krylov model reduction, thereby decreasing computational cost and time while maintaining solution accuracy within the MAPDL environment.", "keywords": ["Krylov", "reduced-order solver", "MAPDL", "harmonic analysis", "subspace generation", "orthogonality check", "residual calculation", "finite element model", "model reduction", "AnsMath", "AnsVec", "Python API"], "summary_hash": "577c24bba0fc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:58:57+00:00"}
