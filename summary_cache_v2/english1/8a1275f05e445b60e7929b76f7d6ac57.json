{"summary": "A dictionary‑based transform that extracts a configurable number of random sub‑regions from image and label arrays, where each crop is centered on a voxel belonging to a specific class. The selection of crop centers follows user‑defined class ratios (or uniform if omitted) and can be constrained by an optional image intensity mask or pre‑computed class indices. The transform adapts to input size, supports optional handling of smaller dimensions, and can operate lazily.", "business_intent": "Enable class‑balanced patch extraction for training segmentation models, especially in medical imaging, by providing flexible, random, label‑aware cropping that improves data diversity and representation of all classes.", "keywords": ["random cropping", "class‑balanced sampling", "label‑based ROI", "dictionary transform", "spatial size adaptation", "lazy execution", "medical image augmentation", "segmentation preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "7031bdd9f8af", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:05:03+00:00"}
