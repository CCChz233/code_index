{"summary": "The module defines a collection of benchmark helper classes that generate random quantum circuits, configure specific Qiskit transpiler passes, execute them, and record execution times. These utilities enable systematic performance profiling of various optimization passes such as two‑qubit block consolidation, commutative cancellation analysis, multi‑qubit block handling, and basis‑change passes.", "business_intent": "To provide developers and researchers with tools for measuring and comparing the runtime efficiency of quantum circuit compilation passes, supporting optimization of the transpilation workflow and informing improvements to the Qiskit compiler.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "quantum circuit", "transpiler", "benchmark", "performance profiling", "optimization pass", "timing measurement", "2-qubit block", "commutative analysis", "multi-qubit block", "basis transformation"], "summary_hash": "77a518d06c31", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:35:49+00:00"}
