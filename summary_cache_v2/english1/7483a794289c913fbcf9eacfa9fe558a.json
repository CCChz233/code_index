{"summary": "This module defines a diffusion‑based pipeline that converts a single input image into a series of video frames. It leverages a VAE for latent encoding/decoding, a text encoder and tokenizer for prompt conditioning, a UNet combined with a motion adapter for spatio‑temporal denoising, and configurable schedulers to iteratively generate the animation.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use AI tool for creating animated video clips from still images, supporting creative workflows such as content generation, visual storytelling, and rapid prototyping of motion effects.", "keywords": ["diffusion pipeline", "image to video", "animation generation", "VAE latent encoding", "text prompt conditioning", "motion‑aware UNet", "scheduler", "AI content creation", "stable diffusion", "latent interpolation"], "summary_hash": "5425408e1ade", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:02:09+00:00"}
