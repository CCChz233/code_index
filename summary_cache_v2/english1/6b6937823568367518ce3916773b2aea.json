{"summary": "Implements a BERT‑based question answering model within the NeMo framework. The class wraps a pretrained BERT encoder with a token‑classification head, prepares QA datasets, computes span loss, tracks QA metrics, and integrates with PyTorch‑Lightning for training, validation, testing, and inference, returning answer span predictions.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to quickly fine‑tune and deploy a state‑of‑the‑art BERT model for extracting answer spans from passages in question‑answering applications.", "keywords": ["BERT", "question answering", "token classification", "span loss", "NLP", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "pretrained transformer", "model training", "inference", "answer extraction"], "summary_hash": "dd08f620d337", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:36:06+00:00"}
