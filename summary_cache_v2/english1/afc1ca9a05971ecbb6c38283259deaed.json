{"summary": "Defines an abstract base class for logical quantum control channels and a hierarchy of concrete channel types (drive, measurement, acquisition, control, snapshot, memory, register, and classical I/O). Each channel is identified by a type prefix and an index, with built‑in validation, naming, equality, hashing and parameter handling, allowing pulse schedules to refer to virtual hardware lines that backends later map to physical signal paths.", "business_intent": "Provide a hardware‑agnostic interface for constructing and manipulating pulse‑level quantum programs, enabling developers to specify control, readout, and classical data channels uniformly while delegating the translation to physical hardware or simulators to the backend.", "keywords": ["quantum pulse", "channel abstraction", "virtual hardware", "drive channel", "measurement channel", "acquisition channel", "control channel", "snapshot", "memory slot", "register slot", "Qiskit", "quantum control"], "summary_hash": "4651c94f4ba6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:50:43+00:00"}
