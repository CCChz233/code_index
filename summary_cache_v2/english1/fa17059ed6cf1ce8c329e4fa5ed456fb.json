{"summary": "Implements a differentiable JPEG codec that simulates the full encode‑decode pipeline while keeping the operations differentiable, allowing gradients to flow through compression. Supports per‑batch quality factors, optional custom or learnable quantization tables, and works on tensors in the [0,1] range.", "business_intent": "Facilitates research and development of models that need to account for JPEG compression effects, such as compression‑aware training, artifact removal, image restoration, or learning optimal quantization tables within end‑to‑end deep learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["differentiable JPEG", "image compression", "gradient backpropagation", "quantization tables", "learnable parameters", "quality factor", "batch processing", "neural network training", "artifact removal"], "summary_hash": "9ad9d3d8986a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:50:17+00:00"}
