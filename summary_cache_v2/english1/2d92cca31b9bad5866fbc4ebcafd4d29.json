{"summary": "This module isolates the detection and handling of system‑level resources required by CuPy, such as locating the CUDA toolkit, CUB library, nvcc compiler, and CuPy's own installation directories. It offers utilities for logging, configuring library preloading, and managing Windows DLL search paths, all without importing other CuPy components.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable, platform‑agnostic way for CuPy to discover and configure native CUDA dependencies at runtime, enabling proper installation, environment setup, and optional library preloading while keeping the environment logic independent of the rest of the library.", "keywords": ["environment detection", "CUDA toolkit path", "CUB library path", "nvcc location", "library preload configuration", "Windows DLL directory", "logging utilities", "path getters", "runtime configuration"], "summary_hash": "8698fa58285f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:17:59+00:00"}
