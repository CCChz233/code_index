{"summary": "This package supplies a collection of handler classes that abstract interaction with a variety of proprietary large language models. Each handler constructs conversation payloads, merges tool specifications, sends requests through the model's client (often using an OpenAI‑compatible interface), parses the returned function‑call data or abstract syntax trees, and optionally runs generated code, thereby offering a consistent API for the function‑call leaderboard framework.", "business_intent": "To provide a unified integration layer that enables the function‑call leaderboard to benchmark, evaluate, and compare the function‑calling capabilities of multiple proprietary LLM providers.", "keywords": ["proprietary language model", "handler", "function calling", "tool integration", "message history", "prompt construction", "API client", "AST decoding", "code execution", "benchmark", "OpenAI compatible"], "summary_hash": "b855491f7f4f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:47:02+00:00"}
