{"summary": "This module implements a high‑performance Pedersen hash based on Starkware elliptic‑curve parameters. It defines curve constants, pre‑computed points, and low‑level utilities to process field elements and compute the hash efficiently.", "business_intent": "Provide a fast, reliable cryptographic hashing primitive for Starkware‑based protocols and applications, such as zero‑knowledge proof systems and blockchain components, where deterministic elliptic‑curve hashing is required.", "keywords": ["Pedersen hash", "elliptic curve", "Starkware", "cryptography", "fast hash", "field arithmetic", "precomputed points", "zero‑knowledge proofs", "blockchain", "ECDSA utilities"], "summary_hash": "4ce11b89b0a5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:43:02+00:00"}
