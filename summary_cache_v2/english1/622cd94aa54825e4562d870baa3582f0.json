{"summary": "The module implements components for graph representation learning using DGL and PyTorch. It provides a multi‑layer feed‑forward network with skip connections, two graph encoders—one based on GIN convolutions with sum pooling and another using NNConv with GRU updates and Set2Set pooling—and builds the InfoGraph architecture for contrastive and semi‑supervised training, exposing both supervised and unsupervised forward passes.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to train graph neural networks with self‑supervised and semi‑supervised objectives for downstream tasks such as graph classification, regression, or molecular property prediction, leveraging the InfoGraph framework.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "GIN", "NNConv", "InfoGraph", "contrastive learning", "self‑supervised", "semi‑supervised", "PyTorch", "DGL", "graph embedding", "pooling", "Set2Set", "GRU"], "summary_hash": "ae0fb6a922cb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:54:45+00:00"}
