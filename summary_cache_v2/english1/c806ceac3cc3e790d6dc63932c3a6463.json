{"summary": "Provides a BWA‑aln wrapper that maintains a persistent alignment process, streams reads, parses SAM output into structured objects, and offers single‑read and batch alignment capabilities. Builds on this to detect unintended genomic binding sites for primers and primer pairs, applying user‑defined specificity thresholds and reporting detailed mapping results with pass/fail status.", "business_intent": "Help molecular biology and bioinformatics users evaluate primer designs by automatically identifying and scoring potential off‑target binding events, ensuring high specificity in PCR and related assays.", "keywords": ["BWA", "alignment", "SAM parsing", "off‑target detection", "primer specificity", "genomic binding sites", "batch processing", "bioinformatics", "PCR design", "reference genome"], "summary_hash": "3f5ad9ad8653", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:13:06+00:00"}
