{"summary": "Utility module for simulating and augmenting speech data used in automatic speech recognition pipelines. It offers functions for manipulating audio signals (normalization, scaling, adding silence, perturbations), handling background noise, processing alignment information, and managing speaker‑specific sample collections. The DataAnnotator and SpeechSampler classes orchestrate the creation of synthetic utterances and corresponding annotations.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the generation of diverse, realistic training data for ASR models by programmatically augmenting clean speech with noise, silence, and speaker variations, thereby improving model robustness and performance in real‑world conditions.", "keywords": ["audio augmentation", "speech simulation", "ASR data preparation", "speaker sampling", "background noise", "audio normalization", "alignment manipulation", "data annotation", "audio perturbation"], "summary_hash": "280c98f95b1b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:13:05+00:00"}
