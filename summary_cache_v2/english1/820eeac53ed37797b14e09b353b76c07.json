{"summary": "PatchSequential orchestrates image augmentation by dividing each input tensor into a configurable grid of patches, then applying a sequence of augmentation modules either independently per patch or uniformly across all patches. It supports random selection of transformations, batch‑wise consistency, padding options, and reversible operations with parameter tracking.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, fine‑grained augmentation pipeline for computer‑vision models that enhances data diversity through localized transformations while allowing deterministic behavior and inversion of applied augmentations.", "keywords": ["patchwise augmentation", "grid splitting", "image augmentation", "random apply", "same_on_batch", "padding", "invertible transforms", "kornia", "computer vision", "data augmentation", "local transformations"], "summary_hash": "40f264ddc72d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:52:42+00:00"}
