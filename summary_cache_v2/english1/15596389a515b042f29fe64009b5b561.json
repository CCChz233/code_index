{"summary": "This module defines a transformer model class that augments a standard architecture with hook points at every major activation, allowing users to capture, modify, and inspect internal states. It supports loading pretrained weights, configuration‑driven initialization, device placement, tokenization utilities, text generation, and efficient key/value caching for inference.", "business_intent": "Provide a research‑oriented tool for probing, debugging, and experimenting with transformer internals, enabling interpretability studies and fine‑grained manipulation of model activations.", "keywords": ["transformer", "hook points", "activation inspection", "pretrained model loading", "tokenization", "text generation", "key/value caching", "model interpretability", "neural network analysis", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "b4f3dac1cfcb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:20:42+00:00"}
