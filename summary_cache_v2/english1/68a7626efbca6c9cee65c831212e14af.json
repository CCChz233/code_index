{"summary": "Implements a Bahdanau‑style additive attention layer that combines a query with key/value tensors to produce context vectors. It computes non‑linear scores, optionally scales them, applies dropout and various masks (padding, causal), normalizes with softmax, and returns the weighted sum of values together with optional attention scores.", "business_intent": "Enable neural network models, especially sequence‑to‑sequence and transformer architectures, to dynamically focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, improving performance on tasks such as translation, summarization, and speech recognition.", "keywords": ["additive attention", "Bahdanau", "query", "key", "value", "softmax", "scaling", "dropout", "masking", "causal mask", "context vector", "neural network layer"], "summary_hash": "4c7052667a9e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:58:34+00:00"}
