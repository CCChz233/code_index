{"summary": "Defines a 3‑dimensional transformer model that integrates patch embeddings, positional encodings, attention blocks, and adaptive layer normalization to process volumetric data within diffusion pipelines. It supports configurable initialization, optional gradient checkpointing, and produces structured transformer outputs.", "business_intent": "Supply a reusable neural component for generative AI systems that require efficient 3D feature extraction and transformation, facilitating high‑quality image or video synthesis in diffusion‑based models.", "keywords": ["3D transformer", "latent diffusion", "attention block", "gradient checkpointing", "patch embedding", "positional encoding", "AdaLayerNorm", "PyTorch", "model configuration", "inference"], "summary_hash": "eb13bf4ff4a8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:30:09+00:00"}
