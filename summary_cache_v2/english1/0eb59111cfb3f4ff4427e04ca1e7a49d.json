{"summary": "The file defines a collection of Flax modules and utilities for building a variational autoencoder (VAE) tailored for diffusion models. It includes encoder and decoder blocks, attention mechanisms, up/down‑sampling layers, and a diagonal Gaussian distribution class for latent space handling. The main autoencoder class integrates these components to encode images into a latent distribution and decode them back, supporting configurable architecture parameters and JAX‑accelerated training.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑performance, JAX‑based VAE component that can be used in research and production pipelines for latent diffusion, enabling efficient encoding/decoding of images and latent space manipulation.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "VAE", "Flax", "JAX", "diffusion models", "encoder", "decoder", "latent space", "KL divergence", "attention", "up‑sampling", "down‑sampling", "group normalization"], "summary_hash": "871e8f8a950e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:15:25+00:00"}
