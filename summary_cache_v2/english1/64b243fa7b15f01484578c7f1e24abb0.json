{"summary": "This module contains a comprehensive test suite for the synthetic radiography utilities used in charged‑particle plasma diagnostics. It validates that generated radiographs produce correct intensity and optical‑density histograms, that the functions handle invalid inputs with appropriate errors and warnings, and includes auxiliary helpers for setting up particle trackers and example simulations.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the accuracy and robustness of synthetic radiography calculations in plasma diagnostic software, thereby supporting reliable scientific analysis and maintaining high code quality through automated testing.", "keywords": ["synthetic radiography", "proton radiography", "unit testing", "intensity histogram", "optical density", "error handling", "warnings", "plasma diagnostics", "particle tracker", "grid validation"], "summary_hash": "628e740c0a2c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:13:02+00:00"}
