{"summary": "Provides a transpiler pass that scans a circuit for consecutive single‑qubit operations, merges them into an equivalent unitary, and replaces the chain with a single synthesized gate (or removes it if it is effectively the identity). The decision is based on the target basis‑gate set, estimated error, and presence of pulse‑level gates, using an Euler‑angle decomposition routine.", "business_intent": "Reduce circuit depth and error by consolidating single‑qubit gates into optimal representations, thereby enhancing execution fidelity and meeting hardware gate constraints during quantum compilation.", "keywords": ["quantum transpilation", "single-qubit optimization", "Euler decomposition", "gate synthesis", "error mitigation", "basis gate compatibility", "circuit depth reduction"], "summary_hash": "629034887dcb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:25:24+00:00"}
