{"summary": "The module builds a composite finite‑state transducer that tokenizes and classifies electronic‑related expressions (such as emails, URLs, and numbers) within English sentences, handling punctuation, case sensitivity, and both deterministic and nondeterministic transductions, and can export the model as an OpenFst FAR for deployment.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate text normalization of electronic tokens in speech or language applications, improving downstream TTS or NLP performance.", "keywords": ["text normalization", "finite state transducer", "classification", "tokenization", "English", "electronic entities", "OpenFst", "FAR", "deterministic", "nondeterministic", "punctuation", "case sensitivity", "deployment"], "summary_hash": "2709c361befc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:46:10+00:00"}
