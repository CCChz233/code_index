{"summary": "Provides a collection of helper functions for the grapheme‑to‑phoneme (G2P) stage of a text‑to‑speech pipeline, including utilities to extract heteronym span data, translate word identifiers into phoneme sequences, load word‑ID resources, clean punctuation from text, and normalize grapheme case (lower, mixed, upper). These tools facilitate preprocessing and lookup operations required for accurate phoneme generation.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to build more reliable and natural‑sounding TTS systems by supplying essential preprocessing and lookup utilities that handle complex spelling‑to‑sound mappings, heteronym disambiguation, and case‑sensitive text handling.", "keywords": ["grapheme-to-phoneme", "text-to-speech", "utility functions", "heteronym handling", "phoneme mapping", "text preprocessing", "case normalization", "punctuation removal", "word identifier lookup"], "summary_hash": "cf92af4f632e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:01:43+00:00"}
