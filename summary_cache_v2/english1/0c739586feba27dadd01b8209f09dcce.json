{"summary": "Defines a set of abstract base classes and helper utilities for the NeMo text‑to‑speech stack, covering grapheme‑to‑phoneme conversion, spectrogram generation, mel‑to‑linear conversion, and flow‑based vocoding. The module standardizes model discovery, preprocessing, inference, bias correction, denoising, and export mechanisms for end‑to‑end TTS pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to rapidly assemble, customize, and deploy high‑quality TTS solutions by providing a unified, extensible framework for core speech synthesis components within the NVIDIA NeMo ecosystem.", "keywords": ["text-to-speech", "TTS", "grapheme-to-phoneme", "vocoder", "spectrogram", "audio synthesis", "neural network", "model abstraction", "inference", "pretrained models", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "e13b2df1b6d5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:57:06+00:00"}
