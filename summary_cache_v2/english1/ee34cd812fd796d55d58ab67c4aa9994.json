{"summary": "The module defines a set of classes that implement the advection step required by MODFLOW‑6 transport simulations. It offers three numerical weighting schemes—central‑in‑space, first‑order upstream, and implicit second‑order TVD—each encapsulated in its own class, together with utilities for applying spatial masks and visualising the resulting concentration fields.", "business_intent": "Provide flexible, reliable tools for groundwater modelers to compute solute transport with controllable numerical dispersion and stability, allowing them to choose between fast but diffusive methods or more accurate, robust schemes depending on project needs.", "keywords": ["advection", "MODFLOW6", "groundwater transport", "central weighting", "upstream weighting", "TVD", "numerical dispersion", "stability", "concentration interpolation", "visualisation", "spatial mask"], "summary_hash": "c51e55c760c7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:49:58+00:00"}
