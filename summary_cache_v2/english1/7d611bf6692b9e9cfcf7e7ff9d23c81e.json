{"summary": "This module defines a foundational base class that encapsulates the common interface and shared utilities required for guiding text‑to‑image generation within neural radiance field (NeRF) pipelines. It standardizes how guidance information is integrated, allowing specialized subclasses to implement specific guidance strategies while reusing common functionality.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, extensible foundation for building custom text‑to‑image guidance components, enabling faster development of multimodal AI solutions that combine language prompts with image synthesis in NeRF‑based systems.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "guidance", "base class", "interface", "NeRF", "neural radiance fields", "multimodal", "AI generation", "extensible", "modular"], "summary_hash": "6cc07fbecc54", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:01:09+00:00"}
