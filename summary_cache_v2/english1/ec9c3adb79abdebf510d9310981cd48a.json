{"summary": "This module defines the core neural components used in the Stable Audio diffusion pipeline, such as layers that embed scalar conditioning values, generate positional embeddings from continuous time coordinates, and project both text encoder embeddings and numeric conditions into a shared latent space for audio generation, together with a structured output container for the projected representations.", "business_intent": "Supply reusable building blocks that enable audio generation models to be conditioned on numeric parameters and textual prompts, supporting the development and deployment of stable audio synthesis systems.", "keywords": ["stable audio", "audio generation", "conditioning", "positional embedding", "latent projection", "text embedding", "diffusion model", "neural network", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "5e594f76ea12", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:22:08+00:00"}
