{"summary": "Implements the decoder side of a compact BlenderBot model by stacking a configurable number of transformer decoder layers. It receives token IDs, converts them to embeddings, passes them through the stacked layers to produce contextual hidden states ready for language generation.", "business_intent": "Provides the core decoding functionality for a lightweight conversational AI system, enabling the model to generate coherent responses in chat or dialogue applications.", "keywords": ["Transformer decoder", "BlenderBot", "neural language generation", "stacked layers", "token embeddings", "sequence modeling", "chatbot", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "690be7a99794", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:02:02+00:00"}
