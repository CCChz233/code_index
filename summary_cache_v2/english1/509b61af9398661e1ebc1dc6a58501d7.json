{"summary": "The module implements a suite of data processors that ingest raw dialogue resources (CSV, JSON, etc.) from various benchmarks (e.g., Schema‑Guided Dialogue, MS MARCO, Mellon QA, design‑focused corpora) and transform them into a unified collection of structured dialogue examples. Each processor parses domain‑specific metadata, normalizes utterances, tokenizes content, and exposes train, validation, test, and auxiliary splits along with entry indices for downstream NeMo conversational AI models.", "business_intent": "Facilitate rapid development and evaluation of conversational NLP systems by providing ready‑to‑use, consistently formatted dialogue datasets, reducing the engineering effort required to load, preprocess, and split raw conversational data for model training and benchmarking.", "keywords": ["dialogue data processing", "dataset loaders", "training/validation/test splits", "NeMo", "conversational AI", "NLP preprocessing", "Schema‑Guided Dialogue", "MS MARCO", "Mellon QA", "design dialogue", "CSV", "JSON", "structured examples"], "summary_hash": "c0af6f7ae4b0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:10:22+00:00"}
