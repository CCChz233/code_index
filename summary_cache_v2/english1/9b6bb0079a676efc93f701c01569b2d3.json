{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have file tests/test_vis_gradbased.py. It's a test module for gradient-based visualization methods in MONAI (medical imaging). It imports DenseNet, DenseNet121, SEResNet50, and visualization classes: GuidedBackpropGrad, GuidedBackpropSmoothGrad, SmoothGrad, VanillaGrad. Also uses parameterized, torch, unittest. It defines some global model instances: DENSENET2D, DENSENET2DADJOINT, DENSENET3D, SENET2D, SENET3D, TESTS.
