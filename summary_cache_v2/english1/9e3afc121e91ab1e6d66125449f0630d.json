{"summary": "Provides a PyTorch loss module that computes adversarial losses for patch‑based discriminators, automatically selecting and applying the correct activation function and reduction strategy based on the specified criterion (hinge, least‑squares, or binary cross‑entropy).", "business_intent": "Enables developers of medical imaging GANs to easily incorporate configurable adversarial training objectives for patch discriminators, improving flexibility and reducing boilerplate when experimenting with different loss formulations.", "keywords": ["adversarial loss", "patch discriminator", "hinge loss", "least squares loss", "binary cross entropy", "activation function", "loss reduction", "MONAI", "PyTorch", "GAN training", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "31b52ec1836d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:15:33+00:00"}
