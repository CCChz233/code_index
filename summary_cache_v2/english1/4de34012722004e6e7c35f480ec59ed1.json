{"summary": "This module implements a custom Stable Diffusion pipeline that enables repainting or inpainting of images. It prepares masks and masked inputs, runs the diffusion process, and returns edited images, leveraging the Diffusers library and related transformer models.", "business_intent": "Provide an AI-powered image editing solution that allows users to selectively modify or regenerate parts of an image using Stable Diffusion, facilitating creative workflows and content generation.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "image repaint", "inpainting", "mask generation", "diffusion pipeline", "AI image editing", "PyTorch", "transformers", "computer vision", "content creation"], "summary_hash": "b84e3ae852f3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:00:35+00:00"}
