{"summary": "The module defines a set of preprocessing utilities for text‑to‑speech pipelines that transform acoustic feature tensors. It includes generic processing interfaces and concrete implementations for scaling, logarithmic compression, mean‑variance normalization, and speaker‑level normalization, enabling consistent and clean feature representations before model consumption.", "business_intent": "To standardize and enhance audio feature data for TTS models, improving training stability and synthesis quality by applying configurable preprocessing steps such as scaling, compression, and normalization.", "keywords": ["TTS preprocessing", "feature scaling", "log compression", "mean variance normalization", "speaker normalization", "acoustic features", "machine learning", "audio data preparation"], "summary_hash": "11da3ab14648", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:58:08+00:00"}
