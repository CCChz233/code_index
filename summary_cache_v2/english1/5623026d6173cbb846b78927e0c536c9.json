{"summary": "This module implements a differentiable Stein’s Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) based loss for evaluating neural network operators using only pseudo‑ground‑truth data, enabling training in scenarios where true labels are unavailable, such as zero‑filled MRI reconstruction. It also provides supporting utility functions related to complex-valued loss calculations.", "business_intent": "Offer a loss solution that allows developers to train medical imaging reconstruction models without requiring fully sampled reference data, thereby reducing data acquisition costs and accelerating research and deployment of AI‑driven imaging pipelines.", "keywords": ["Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator", "SURE loss", "unsupervised training", "pseudo ground truth", "MRI reconstruction", "zero-filled data", "differentiable loss", "PyTorch", "MONAI", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "e4e7fcabfc4b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:15:29+00:00"}
