{"summary": "The class models a controlled‑RZ (CRZ) quantum gate, a two‑qubit diagonal operation that applies a Z‑axis rotation to the target qubit conditioned on the control qubit being in the |1⟩ state. It supplies the gate’s matrix definition, inversion logic and integration with Qiskit circuits.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable component that lets developers add conditional phase‑shift operations to quantum circuits, supporting algorithm design, simulation and hardware execution within the Qiskit framework.", "keywords": ["controlled‑RZ", "conditional phase rotation", "quantum gate", "Qiskit", "quantum circuit", "matrix representation", "phase shift", "two‑qubit gate"], "summary_hash": "85366ec09ea5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:30:30+00:00"}
