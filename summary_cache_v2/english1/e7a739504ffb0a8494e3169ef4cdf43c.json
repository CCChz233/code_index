{"summary": "This module implements the client‑side execution engine for Prefect, coordinating the lifecycle of flow runs and task runs. It provides entry points for invoking flows and tasks, manages a global event loop, interacts with task runners, handles state transitions, emits events, and supports pausing, resuming, and cancelling runs while communicating with the Prefect orchestration API.", "business_intent": "To give Prefect users a robust, flexible runtime that can execute workflows locally, handle asynchronous and synchronous calls, manage concurrency, and ensure proper state management and integration with the Prefect backend for reliable workflow orchestration.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "workflow orchestration", "flow execution", "task execution", "state management", "asynchronous", "concurrency", "event loop", "task runner", "pause", "resume", "cancellation", "client-side engine"], "summary_hash": "13849f7ef445", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:24:15+00:00"}
