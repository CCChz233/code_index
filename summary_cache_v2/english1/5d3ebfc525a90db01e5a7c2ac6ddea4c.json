{"summary": "The module implements a complete in‑memory mock of the AWS Elastic Load Balancing v2 service for the Moto library. It defines service‑specific exception types, data models for load balancers, listeners, rules, target groups and related entities, utilities for building ARNs, and a set of response handlers that emulate the ELBv2 API operations such as create, describe, modify and delete resources, including support for tagging, certificates and CloudFormation integration.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to write automated tests and simulations of applications that interact with ELBv2 without contacting real AWS endpoints, providing realistic error handling and resource behavior for unit, integration and infrastructure‑as‑code testing.", "keywords": ["ELBv2", "mock", "AWS", "load balancer", "listener", "target group", "API simulation", "testing", "Moto", "exceptions", "ARN utility", "tagging", "CloudFormation"], "summary_hash": "1a39b2bcb4e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:55:48+00:00"}
