{"summary": "Constructs a graph from one or several point sets by turning each point into a node and linking it to its k nearest neighbors (the node itself is included). When multiple sets are given, they are concatenated into a single graph with node IDs offset according to the sizes of preceding sets.", "business_intent": "Offers a preprocessing layer that converts raw point cloud tensors into a DGL graph structure, enabling graph neural networks to perform neighbor‑based message passing on segmented or batched point data.", "keywords": ["k-nearest neighbors", "graph construction", "point cloud", "batched processing", "node ID mapping", "DGL", "PyTorch", "graph neural network preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "71250be68bd9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:51:31+00:00"}
