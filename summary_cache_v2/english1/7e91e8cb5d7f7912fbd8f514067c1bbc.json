{"summary": "The module supplies a collection of Qiskit circuit components that generate quantum states and embed classical data into quantum registers. It includes utilities for amplitude encoding, generic state preparation, and several parameterized feature maps based on Pauli‑Z and higher‑order Pauli expansions, with optional entanglement and repetitions.", "business_intent": "Provide ready‑to‑use building blocks for quantum algorithms that require data loading and state initialization, facilitating quantum machine‑learning, variational, and simulation workflows.", "keywords": ["quantum state preparation", "amplitude encoding", "feature map", "Pauli expansion", "Z-rotation", "entanglement", "parameterized circuit", "Qiskit", "quantum machine learning", "data encoding"], "summary_hash": "de92957fb3bd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:07:34+00:00"}
