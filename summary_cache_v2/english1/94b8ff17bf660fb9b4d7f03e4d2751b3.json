{"summary": "A collection of benchmark suites for Qiskit Pulse that measure the execution time of loading default pulse configurations, constructing echoed cross‑resonance gate circuits with parameterized pulse schedules, and lowering pulse schedules into Qobj representations. The benchmarks include utilities for generating sample quantum circuits and setting up a consistent pulse environment to obtain performance metrics.", "business_intent": "Supply developers and performance engineers with quantitative data on critical Qiskit Pulse operations, enabling identification of bottlenecks and guiding optimization efforts for faster configuration loading, schedule creation, and schedule conversion.", "keywords": ["Qiskit Pulse", "benchmark", "performance measurement", "default configuration loading", "schedule construction", "cross-resonance gate", "parameterized pulse schedules", "schedule lowering", "Qobj", "quantum circuit"], "summary_hash": "7471adb19484", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:10:51+00:00"}
