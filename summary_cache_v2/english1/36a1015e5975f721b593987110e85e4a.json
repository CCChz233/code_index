{"summary": "Provides a Stable Diffusion‑based text‑to‑image generation pipeline that can incorporate T2I‑Adapter modules for extra conditioning. The module defines the main pipeline class handling prompt encoding, latent preparation, guided denoising, VAE decoding, optional safety checking, and returns results via a structured output container. It also includes auxiliary utilities for image preprocessing and timestep handling, though some are currently unused.", "business_intent": "Offer a turnkey solution for developers and creative professionals to generate high‑quality, controllable images from textual descriptions, with optional adapter‑driven style or content guidance and built‑in safety filtering, enabling applications in design, marketing, entertainment, and other content‑creation workflows.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "text-to-image", "T2I‑Adapter", "diffusion pipeline", "image generation", "adapter conditioning", "safety checking", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "CLIP", "output container"], "summary_hash": "48a2751dd5e2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:19:42+00:00"}
