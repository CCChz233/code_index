{"summary": "A toolkit that enables large language models to translate natural language queries into executable API calls across multiple programming languages, supporting single, multiple, and parallel function invocations with relevance detection. It includes helpers for constructing prompts, invoking hosted OpenAI‑compatible endpoints, running models locally with HuggingFace Transformers, and parsing/cleaning generated function call strings.", "business_intent": "Empower developers to build AI‑driven applications that can automatically generate and execute appropriate function calls from user input, offering both cloud‑hosted and on‑premise inference options.", "keywords": ["LLM", "function calling", "API generation", "multiple calls", "parallel calls", "prompt engineering", "hosted inference", "local inference", "HuggingFace", "OpenAI compatible", "Python", "Java", "JavaScript", "REST"], "summary_hash": "f352b2fefcf0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:45:43+00:00"}
