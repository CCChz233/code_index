{"summary": "This module provides a command‑line pipeline that reads local PDF (or other) documents, splits them into semantic chunks, generates instruction‑answer pairs using optional transformer pipelines, and assembles the results into Hugging Face datasets. It includes utilities for argument parsing, checkpoint saving/loading, and progress tracking, enabling fully local dataset creation for fine‑tuning conversational AI models.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to create high‑quality instruction‑following datasets from their own documents without external services, supporting local fine‑tuning and evaluation of language models.", "keywords": ["PDF processing", "text chunking", "instruction generation", "label creation", "Hugging Face dataset", "checkpoint management", "transformers pipeline", "command‑line interface", "local dataset preparation", "model fine‑tuning"], "summary_hash": "319a81e2991a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:45:32+00:00"}
