{"summary": "The module defines utilities to transform a Transformer model into a tensor‑parallel version that can be executed across a device mesh. It configures column‑wise, row‑wise, and sequence parallelism, applies mixed‑precision policies, and integrates Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) sharding and checkpointing to enable efficient distributed training of large models.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, high‑performance training of large transformer models by automatically parallelizing their tensors across multiple GPUs with mixed‑precision and memory‑saving techniques.", "keywords": ["transformer", "tensor parallelism", "distributed training", "FSDP", "mixed precision", "sharding", "device mesh", "checkpointing", "columnwise parallel", "rowwise parallel", "sequence parallel"], "summary_hash": "fd0efe518cd7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:50:37+00:00"}
