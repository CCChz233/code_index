{"summary": "A PyTorch/DGL example that implements the Deep Generative Model of Graphs (DG-MG) from the referenced paper. It provides configuration mirroring the original experiments, utilities for handling cyclic graph datasets, a model definition with graph propagation, node/edge addition actions, and sequential decision making, as well as a command‑line training and evaluation script with checkpointing and optional inference generation. Supporting utilities handle logging, weight initialization, and file naming.", "business_intent": "To enable researchers and developers to reproduce, benchmark, and extend the DG-MG approach for graph generation tasks, such as molecular graph synthesis, by offering a ready‑to‑run training and inference pipeline in PyTorch.", "keywords": ["deep generative models", "graph generation", "PyTorch", "DGL", "DG-MG", "graph neural networks", "molecular graphs", "training pipeline", "evaluation", "configuration"], "summary_hash": "432c41bed536", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:55:29+00:00"}
