{"summary": "The class serves as a unified processor for TVLT models by encapsulating an image preprocessing component and a feature extraction component. It accepts raw image data, applies the required transformations, extracts model‑ready features, and assembles the output in the format expected by the downstream model.", "business_intent": "Provide a single, easy‑to‑use interface that streamlines the data preparation workflow for TVLT applications, reducing the need for separate preprocessing and feature extraction steps and thereby accelerating development and deployment.", "keywords": ["TVLT", "image preprocessing", "feature extraction", "combined processor", "model input preparation", "computer vision pipeline", "transformer"], "summary_hash": "3058dee936a2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:28:17+00:00"}
