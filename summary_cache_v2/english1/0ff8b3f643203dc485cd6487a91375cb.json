{"summary": "This module offers a reference implementation of the DiffPool hierarchical graph neural network using DGL and PyTorch. It includes data‑preprocessing utilities for graph features, adjacency matrices, and one‑hot label conversion, as well as a command‑line training script that loads benchmark graph classification datasets, constructs the DiffPool model, and runs training and evaluation loops.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to easily reproduce and benchmark DiffPool‑based graph classification, providing a baseline implementation for experimentation and further development of hierarchical graph pooling techniques.", "keywords": ["DiffPool", "graph neural network", "hierarchical pooling", "DGL", "PyTorch", "graph classification", "benchmark datasets", "data preprocessing", "one‑hot encoding", "training pipeline"], "summary_hash": "9df5b8ee105d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:53:19+00:00"}
