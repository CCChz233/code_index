{"summary": "Implements a deprecated Stable Diffusion inpainting pipeline that preprocesses an input image and mask, encodes the text prompt, runs latent denoising with a conditional UNet and scheduler, decodes the final latents to an image, optionally applies a safety checker, and supports loading custom LoRA or textual‑inversion weights.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to add AI‑powered, text‑guided image editing where specific regions of a picture can be filled or altered according to a description, while providing safety filtering and extensibility through custom model adapters.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion", "inpainting", "text‑guided image editing", "latent diffusion", "UNet", "CLIP text encoder", "safety checker", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "image preprocessing", "mask handling", "deprecated pipeline"], "summary_hash": "74974a64ac80", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:44:07+00:00"}
