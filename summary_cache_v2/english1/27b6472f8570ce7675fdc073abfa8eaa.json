{"summary": "This module implements a specialized diffusion scheduler that drives the denoising process for latent consistency models. It manages beta schedules, timestep spacing, scaling factors, clipping, and optional dynamic thresholding, and computes boundary‑condition scalings to ensure consistency across diffusion steps. The scheduler retains configuration state, prepares model inputs, and advances the diffusion trajectory during inference.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑performance, configurable scheduler to accelerate and improve the quality of generative AI inference pipelines that rely on latent consistency diffusion models.", "keywords": ["diffusion scheduler", "latent consistency model", "beta schedule", "timestep scaling", "dynamic thresholding", "generative AI", "inference acceleration", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "54bd0c9aaa72", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:13:14+00:00"}
