{"summary": "Provides a transpiler pass that converts all operations in a quantum circuit to a specified target gate set. It determines the source basis, searches the equivalence library with a Dijkstra algorithm to find a minimal sequence of replacement rules, composes those rules, and rewrites the circuit in‑place, while respecting device‑specific constraints such as non‑global gate definitions.", "business_intent": "Ensures that quantum programs can be executed on a given quantum processor by automatically mapping arbitrary gates to the processor’s supported basis, facilitating reliable and efficient compilation across heterogeneous hardware.", "keywords": ["basis translation", "gate decomposition", "equivalence library", "Dijkstra search", "target basis", "non‑global operations", "quantum transpiler", "circuit rewriting", "quantum compilation"], "summary_hash": "613f2c05c5bf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:46:53+00:00"}
