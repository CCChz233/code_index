{"summary": "The Kedro pipeline package implements the core abstractions for building and managing data processing pipelines. It defines a node abstraction that wraps user functions with declared inputs, outputs, tags, and execution behavior. It provides utilities for copying nodes, prefixing and renaming datasets and parameters, and validating required datasets when embedding modular pipelines into a master pipeline. The Pipeline class represents a directed acyclic graph of nodes, offering inspection of inputs/outputs, dependency analysis, uniqueness validation, cycle detection, and set‑like composition operations. Internal transcoding helpers manage encoded pipeline identifiers.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to construct, compose, and validate modular, reusable data pipelines with clear dataset and parameter mapping, ensuring correct data lineage, preventing cycles and duplicate usage, and simplifying integration of sub‑pipelines within Kedro projects.", "keywords": ["pipeline", "node", "directed acyclic graph", "modular pipelines", "dataset mapping", "parameter handling", "validation", "cycle detection", "transcoding", "exception handling", "Kedro"], "summary_hash": "560d48403a43", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:22:32+00:00"}
