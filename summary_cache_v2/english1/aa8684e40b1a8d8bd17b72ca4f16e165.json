{"summary": "The class implements a mask processor that modifies the amplitude of a specified reference channel in an input signal by applying decibel thresholds, ensuring the signal stays within defined minimum and maximum levels.", "business_intent": "Provide a configurable tool for audio or signal processing pipelines to control the dynamic range of a particular channel, useful for tasks such as noise gating, level normalization, or channel-specific attenuation.", "keywords": ["mask processor", "reference channel", "decibel threshold", "signal amplitude", "audio processing", "dynamic range control", "channel masking", "level normalization"], "summary_hash": "74a5ac383c98", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:12:49+00:00"}
