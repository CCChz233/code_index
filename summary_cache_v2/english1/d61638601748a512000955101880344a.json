{"summary": "The module loads pickled model output data, extracts and formats Health System Interaction (HSI) event records, filters them to a target calibration period, and computes counts of appointment types by date. It then generates several Matplotlib figures that visualise the temporal distribution of HSI events, their breakdown by treatment categories, and the usage of different appointment types, applying colour schemes for facilities and treatment identifiers.", "business_intent": "Provide visual diagnostics of HSI event patterns to support model calibration and validation by comparing simulated health‑system activity across time, treatments, and facilities.", "keywords": ["calibration", "HSI events", "time series", "appointment types", "treatment categories", "visualisation", "pandas", "matplotlib", "data filtering", "model output analysis"], "summary_hash": "3d9e74233898", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:57:20+00:00"}
