{"summary": "Implements an ONNX‑based diffusion pipeline that performs image inpainting with Stable Diffusion. It prepares masks and masked images, runs the UNet and decoder models via ONNX Runtime, and orchestrates the denoising schedule to generate edited images that fill the masked regions.", "business_intent": "Provide a fast, platform‑agnostic solution for automated image editing and content creation, allowing developers to integrate high‑quality inpainting capabilities into applications such as photo retouching, design tools, and creative AI services.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "inpainting", "onnx runtime", "image generation", "mask processing", "diffusion scheduler", "latent diffusion", "computer vision", "AI image editing", "cross‑platform inference"], "summary_hash": "cfe821aa43f1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:25:08+00:00"}
