{"summary": "Represents a while-loop operation in a quantum circuit that repeatedly runs a designated subcircuit while a classical condition holds, ensuring the condition bits are part of the subcircuit's registers and offering helpers for block access, conditional execution, parameter handling, and block replacement.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable component for implementing dynamic, condition‑driven iteration in quantum algorithms, supporting use cases such as repeat‑until‑success, adaptive measurements, and other control‑flow patterns that require looping based on classical outcomes.", "keywords": ["while loop", "quantum circuit", "subcircuit", "classical condition", "iterative execution", "control flow", "parameter management", "block replacement", "conditional operation"], "summary_hash": "c957ac987cd5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:28:04+00:00"}
