{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class NllbDistilledIntegrationTest. It's a test class for NLLB (No Language Left Behind) distilled model integration. The methods test various tokenizer behaviors: batch encode plus, decode ignoring language codes, prepare batch, truncation, language codes, legacy behavior, mask token, seq2seq max length, special tokens unaffected by save/load, tokenizer translation. So class responsibility: integration tests for NLLB distilled tokenizer and model, ensuring correct handling of language codes, special tokens, truncation, masking, translation, etc.\n\nBusiness intent: Validate that the NLLB distilled model's tokenizer and translation pipeline work correctly across languages, preserving special tokens and handling edge cases, to ensure reliable deployment in multilingual applications.\n\nKeywords: NLLB, distilled, integration test, tokenizer, language codes, special tokens, truncation, mask token, seq2seq, translation, legacy behavior, batch encoding, save/load.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed to start with {{ and end with }}?
