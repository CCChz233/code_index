{"summary": "Implements the reverse‑direction phase of a template‑matching algorithm used during quantum circuit transpilation. It consumes an initial forward match, qubit mappings, and both the target circuit and a template circuit, then explores candidate alignments, evaluates heuristics, computes matching metrics, and updates index information to produce a list of backward matches. Supporting data structures encapsulate individual matches and the scenarios under which they are evaluated.", "business_intent": "Enable automated identification and replacement of sub‑circuits that fit a predefined template, thereby reducing gate count and depth in quantum programs and improving overall transpilation performance.", "keywords": ["template matching", "backward direction", "quantum circuit optimization", "Qiskit transpiler", "heuristic evaluation", "candidate discovery", "match representation", "qubit configuration", "circuit pattern replacement"], "summary_hash": "edc904f8148b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:30:51+00:00"}
