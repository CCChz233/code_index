{"summary": "The module implements utilities for preparing training and evaluation data for a PinSAGE graph neural network. It provides iterators that generate batches of item-to-item pairs, functions to sample neighboring nodes or subgraph blocks from a graph, and a collator that transforms raw samples into tensors with appropriate node and edge features for PyTorch models.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable and efficient data pipelines for recommendation systems based on PinSAGE by handling graph sampling, feature assignment, and batch collation required for model training and inference.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "PinSAGE", "sampling", "neighbor sampling", "batch preparation", "collation", "PyTorch", "DGL", "recommendation", "subgraph extraction", "feature assignment", "padding"], "summary_hash": "b521c5d6b016", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:17:44+00:00"}
