{"summary": "The class handles the end‑to‑end preparation of the Schema‑Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset. It loads raw JSON schema and dialogue files, parses service definitions, intents, and slot specifications, and iterates through dialogues to extract turn‑level information such as actions, slot values, and state changes. It transforms these structures into training examples, normalizes intent names, computes sub‑word indices for tokenization, and stores the processed examples for each data split, while exposing convenient accessors for examples, labels, and seen services.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use, pre‑processed representation of SGD dialogues for building and evaluating conversational AI models, including intent classification, slot filling, and dialogue state tracking.", "keywords": ["schema‑guided dialogue", "data loading", "example generation", "intent preprocessing", "slot extraction", "state update", "train/dev/test split", "conversational AI", "dialogue state tracking", "JSON parsing"], "summary_hash": "c128ae78064d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:04:20+00:00"}
