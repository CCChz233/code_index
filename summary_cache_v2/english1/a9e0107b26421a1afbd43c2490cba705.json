{"summary": "This module implements a complete example pipeline for training and evaluating a Graph Attention Network (GAT) on the OGBN-Products node classification benchmark using DGL and PyTorch. It includes data loading, preprocessing, neighbor sampling, model construction, custom loss handling with soft/hard label updates, training loops, and performance evaluation with OGB metrics, as well as utilities for reproducibility and parameter counting.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run reference implementation that enables researchers and engineers to benchmark GAT models on a large-scale product graph, demonstrate best practices for graph neural network training, and provide a foundation for further experimentation or integration into production systems.", "keywords": ["Graph Attention Network", "GAT", "OGBN-Products", "node classification", "DGL", "PyTorch", "graph neural network", "neighbor sampling", "custom loss", "soft labels", "label propagation", "benchmarking", "reproducibility"], "summary_hash": "623ed942f985", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:30:00+00:00"}
