{"summary": "AudioClip is an abstract representation of a sound segment that generates audio samples on demand using a user‑provided function. It stores the clip’s length, sample rate and channel count, and supplies utilities for previewing, iterating over sample blocks, measuring peak volume, converting to a NumPy array, and writing the result to an audio file.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to programmatically create, manipulate, preview, and export audio waveforms without dealing with low‑level file handling, supporting both mono and stereo signals for applications such as music synthesis, sound effects, and audio processing pipelines.", "keywords": ["audio", "waveform", "sample generation", "duration", "channels", "numpy", "preview", "export", "volume analysis", "chunk iteration"], "summary_hash": "e13cf9d21627", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:14:52+00:00"}
