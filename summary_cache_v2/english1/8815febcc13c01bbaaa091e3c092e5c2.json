{"summary": "The module implements core utilities for aligning predicted bounding boxes with ground‑truth annotations in object detection tasks. It handles various edge cases such as absent predictions or missing ground‑truth objects, supports batch‑wise operations, and can incorporate optional ignore masks to exclude certain regions from evaluation.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate and robust evaluation of object detection models by providing reliable matching logic required for computing performance metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision.", "keywords": ["object detection", "bounding box matching", "evaluation", "ground truth", "prediction alignment", "batch processing", "ignore mask", "IoU", "metric computation"], "summary_hash": "b5bad803a5bc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:32:24+00:00"}
