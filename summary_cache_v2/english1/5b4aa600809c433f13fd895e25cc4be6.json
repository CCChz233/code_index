{"summary": "This module offers a collection of utility functions that support image registration workflows. It includes helpers for extracting and augmenting region‑of‑interest (ROI) tables with translation data, applying registration transformations to individual ROI entries, and interfacing with chi‑square based shift calculations. Additional functions provide simple checks for dimensionality and manage zero‑translation placeholders, while leveraging common scientific libraries such as NumPy, Dask, Pandas, and AnnData.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream image‑analysis pipelines to compute and apply spatial alignment corrections efficiently, ensuring that ROI metadata is correctly updated with translation vectors and that registration results can be integrated into larger data processing workflows.", "keywords": ["image registration", "ROI table", "translation", "chi2 shift", "alignment", "utility functions", "dataframe manipulation", "dimensionality check", "scientific computing"], "summary_hash": "78cbd264f2e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:57:18+00:00"}
