{"summary": "The module implements an extractive text summarization pipeline that encodes document sentences with SentenceTransformers, builds a cosine‑similarity graph, and applies the LexRank algorithm—using a Markov transition matrix and power‑iteration eigenvector centrality—to rank and select the most representative sentences as a summary.", "business_intent": "Enable automated generation of concise document summaries for applications such as report condensation, content preview, and information retrieval, reducing manual reading effort and improving knowledge extraction.", "keywords": ["extractive summarization", "sentence embeddings", "cosine similarity", "LexRank", "eigenvector centrality", "Markov transition matrix", "power iteration", "similarity graph", "text summarization", "SentenceTransformers"], "summary_hash": "2cd0512fb375", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:59:46+00:00"}
