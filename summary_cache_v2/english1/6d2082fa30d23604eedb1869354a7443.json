{"summary": "Provides a command‑line tool that fine‑tunes a new textual‑inversion token for Stable Diffusion on CPUs, leveraging bfloat16 precision and Intel‑optimized PyTorch. It builds a custom dataset, sets up Accelerate for single‑node or multi‑node distributed execution, runs the diffusion training loop, periodically saves checkpoints, and optionally uploads the resulting embedding to the Hugging Face hub.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and enterprises to quickly create personalized Stable Diffusion models with minimal data and CPU resources, lowering hardware costs and accelerating deployment of customized generative AI solutions.", "keywords": ["textual inversion", "stable diffusion", "bfloat16", "Intel Extension for PyTorch", "distributed training", "Accelerate", "checkpointing", "Hugging Face hub", "CPU optimization", "fine‑tuning"], "summary_hash": "61e6df00ca58", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:39:11+00:00"}
