{"summary": "The class provides a specialized feature extractor for Whisper-style speech models, converting raw audio waveforms into mel‑filter bank representations using a custom short‑time Fourier transform implementation that aligns with PyTorch’s STFT. It handles sampling‑rate configuration, windowing, FFT sizing, chunking of audio, and optional padding, and offers optional zero‑mean unit‑variance normalization of the extracted features.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable and framework‑agnostic preprocessing of audio data for automatic speech recognition pipelines, ensuring consistent feature formats for Whisper or similar models, which improves model performance and simplifies integration in products that process spoken language.", "keywords": ["mel filter bank", "STFT", "audio preprocessing", "speech recognition", "feature extraction", "numpy implementation", "PyTorch compatibility", "Whisper model", "sampling rate", "padding", "normalization", "chunking"], "summary_hash": "babf114a535a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:55:14+00:00"}
