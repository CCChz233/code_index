{"summary": "Provides a utility class that streamlines the preparation and execution of simulation runs that test different health‑system and vertical‑program scale‑up assumptions. It handles loading predefined scenario definitions, sampling model parameters, configuring logging, and assembling the required model modules before launching the full model.", "business_intent": "Supports policy makers and analysts in comparing the impact of strengthening the overall health system versus expanding disease‑specific interventions by running batch simulations under varied assumptions.", "keywords": ["health system strengthening", "vertical program scale‑up", "scenario simulation", "parameter sampling", "model configuration", "comparative analysis", "batch execution", "policy evaluation"], "summary_hash": "0bf77e4c4b77", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:52:22+00:00"}
