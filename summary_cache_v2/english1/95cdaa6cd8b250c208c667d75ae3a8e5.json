{"summary": "The module implements a class that evaluates lesion detection performance on whole‑slide pathology images using Free‑response Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) analysis. It processes probability maps, applies non‑maximum suppression, generates isolated tumor cell and multi‑instance masks, and calculates false‑positive/true‑positive rates, curve data, and an overall FROC score.", "business_intent": "To give researchers and clinicians a ready‑to‑use tool for quantitatively benchmarking and comparing lesion detection algorithms in digital pathology workflows.", "keywords": ["lesion detection", "FROC", "digital pathology", "whole slide imaging", "evaluation metric", "non‑maximum suppression", "isolated tumor cells", "multi‑instance mask"], "summary_hash": "331116720bfd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:31:50+00:00"}
