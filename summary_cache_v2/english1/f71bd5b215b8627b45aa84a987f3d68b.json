{"summary": "The module implements a Dispersion component for groundwater solute transport models. It calculates the impact of dispersion on solute concentrations, either by directly updating concentration fields or by constructing the coefficient matrix required by a linear solver. The implementation accommodates both isotropic and anisotropic dispersion through configurable longitudinal dispersivity, horizontal and vertical transverse ratios, and optional molecular diffusion.", "business_intent": "Enable environmental engineers and water resource analysts to accurately simulate contaminant spread and water‑quality dynamics in groundwater systems by providing robust dispersion modeling capabilities within numerical transport simulations.", "keywords": ["dispersion", "groundwater modeling", "solute transport", "concentration update", "matrix assembly", "isotropic dispersion", "anisotropic dispersion", "longitudinal dispersivity", "transverse dispersivity", "molecular diffusion", "numerical simulation", "water quality"], "summary_hash": "47c0838dae5b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:46:56+00:00"}
