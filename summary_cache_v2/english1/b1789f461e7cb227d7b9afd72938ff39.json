{"summary": "The module implements a collection of modular neural network blocks for 2‑dimensional UNet architectures, including down‑sampling, up‑sampling, residual, and various attention (self‑attention, cross‑attention, K‑attention) components. These blocks can be combined to build encoder‑decoder models for image‑focused generative tasks such as diffusion pipelines.", "business_intent": "Provide reusable, configurable building blocks that simplify the creation of high‑performance UNet‑style models with advanced attention mechanisms, enabling developers to accelerate development of image synthesis, denoising, and other generative AI applications.", "keywords": ["UNet", "downsampling", "upsampling", "attention", "cross‑attention", "residual block", "convolution", "transformer", "diffusion models", "image generation", "encoder‑decoder"], "summary_hash": "19b886154144", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:29:22+00:00"}
