{"summary": "Provides a base test harness that prepares a single distributed data‑parallel (DDP) environment and a shared pool of worker processes, then offers utilities to execute a large number of parameterized metric tests efficiently. Sub‑classes define specific metric test methods that invoke the provided execution helpers.", "business_intent": "Enable rapid, scalable validation of metric implementations across multiple processes without repeatedly initializing DDP, thereby reducing test runtime and resource overhead in large‑scale machine‑learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["distributed testing", "DDP", "parameterized tests", "process pool", "metric validation", "test framework", "setup/teardown", "scalable testing"], "summary_hash": "ef0abe77d937", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:04:29+00:00"}
