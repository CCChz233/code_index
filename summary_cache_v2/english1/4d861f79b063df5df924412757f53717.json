{"summary": "This module implements a Karras‑based variance‑exploding scheduler for diffusion models using the Flax/JAX framework. It provides a lightweight container for step outputs, a scheduler that manages timestep selection, noise addition, state updates, and correction steps, and a state object that holds configuration and runtime information needed during reverse diffusion sampling.", "business_intent": "Enable fast and numerically stable generation of samples from diffusion models in production environments that rely on JAX/Flax, supporting high‑quality image or signal synthesis with efficient stochastic scheduling.", "keywords": ["Flax", "JAX", "Karras", "variance exploding", "diffusion scheduler", "sampling", "denoising", "timestep", "noise injection", "state management"], "summary_hash": "b44f3c6e8fde", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:13:41+00:00"}
