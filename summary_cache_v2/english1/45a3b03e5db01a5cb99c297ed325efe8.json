{"summary": "Implements a GraphSAGE‑based Graph Neural Network that leverages DGL’s graph clustering mini‑batch sampling to efficiently train on large‑scale node property prediction datasets. The script builds the model, loads OGB benchmark data, performs clustered graph sampling, runs training loops, and reports standard evaluation metrics.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run reference implementation for fast, scalable training of deep graph convolutional networks, enabling researchers and engineers to reproduce state‑of‑the‑art performance on massive graphs such as Reddit and PPI and to integrate efficient GNN training into production pipelines.", "keywords": ["Graph Neural Network", "GraphSAGE", "Cluster-GCN", "DGL", "PyTorch", "large‑scale graph training", "node property prediction", "OGB dataset", "mini‑batch clustering", "performance evaluation"], "summary_hash": "1d6065c2e78f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:53:23+00:00"}
