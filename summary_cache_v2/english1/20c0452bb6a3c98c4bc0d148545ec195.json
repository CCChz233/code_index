{"summary": "The utility package bundles a set of helper tools that support the NGCF (Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering) recommendation system. It includes routines for loading and preprocessing graph‑based interaction data, constructing DGL graphs and adjacency matrices, parsing command‑line arguments, managing experiment directories, and providing early‑stopping logic. Additionally, it offers functions for batch evaluation of recommendation models, computing ranking‑based metrics such as precision, recall, NDCG, AUC, and related scores, with optional multiprocessing for faster testing.", "business_intent": "Enable rapid development, training, and evaluation of graph‑based collaborative filtering models by abstracting common data handling, configuration, and metric computation tasks, thereby reducing engineering effort and accelerating experimentation in recommendation platforms.", "keywords": ["NGCF", "graph neural network", "recommendation system", "data loading", "graph preprocessing", "DGL", "PyTorch", "command-line parsing", "early stopping", "evaluation metrics", "precision", "recall", "NDCG", "AUC", "batch testing", "multiprocessing"], "summary_hash": "00077680c264", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:57:19+00:00"}
