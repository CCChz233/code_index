{"summary": "This module defines the generation of preset pass managers for Qiskit's transpiler. It supplies functions that assemble complete StagedPassManager instances for each optimization level (0‑3) and provides helper routines to construct individual stages such as routing, unrolling, control‑flow handling, and scheduling, which are then used by the high‑level `transpile` API.", "business_intent": "To streamline quantum circuit compilation by automatically configuring and providing ready‑to‑use pass manager pipelines tailored to different optimization levels, allowing developers and end‑users to transpile circuits efficiently without manually selecting or ordering individual compiler passes.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "transpiler", "preset pass manager", "optimization level", "StagedPassManager", "circuit compilation", "pass manager generation", "routing", "unrolling", "control flow", "scheduling", "CouplingMap", "PassManagerConfig", "target"], "summary_hash": "a255979a2a21", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:23:31+00:00"}
