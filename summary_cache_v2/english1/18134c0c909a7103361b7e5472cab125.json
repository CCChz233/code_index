{"summary": "This module defines the data models and helper utilities for version‑1 table specifications used in the Fractal analytics platform. It provides Pydantic‑based classes to encapsulate feature‑table and read‑only masking‑ROI table attributes, perform validation, emit warnings for deprecated table types, and manage legacy compatibility. Additional functions support filtering tables by type, safely writing table data to Zarr stores with optional overwrite protection, and retrieving the current list of tables.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable handling, validation, and storage of V1 table metadata within Fractal workflows, ensuring backward compatibility and safe persistence of feature and ROI tables in Zarr datasets.", "keywords": ["table specifications", "metadata validation", "feature table", "masking ROI table", "legacy compatibility", "Zarr storage", "Pydantic models", "overwrite protection", "Fractal analytics"], "summary_hash": "fa007267a46a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:57:28+00:00"}
