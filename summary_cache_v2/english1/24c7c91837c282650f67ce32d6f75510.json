{"summary": "A fast unit‑test suite that validates the core behavior of the Stable Diffusion 2 pipeline using lightweight dummy components and inputs. It checks that the pipeline produces consistent results across different sampling schedulers, supports attention slicing, handles batch‑vs‑single inference equivalence, and correctly processes long prompts.", "business_intent": "Provide rapid verification of the Stable Diffusion 2 pipeline’s correctness and stability, enabling developers to catch regressions early and ensure reliable generation across various sampling strategies before deployment.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "pipeline", "fast unit tests", "dummy components", "attention slicing", "batch inference consistency", "long prompt handling", "sampling schedulers", "ddim", "k‑euler", "k‑euler‑ancestral", "k‑lms", "pndm", "unflawed"], "summary_hash": "30a63d853a3e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:07:58+00:00"}
