{"summary": "The module defines a suite of unit tests for MONAI's video dataset classes, covering camera‑based streams, generic video datasets, and file‑based video datasets. It verifies dataset construction, source handling, transform application, multi‑source aggregation, parallel loading via DataLoader, and proper error handling when optional dependencies such as OpenCV are missing. Additional checks confirm codec support and dataset integrity.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and robustness of video data ingestion components used in medical imaging AI workflows, ensuring they function reliably across different video sources, transformation pipelines, and execution environments.", "keywords": ["unit tests", "video dataset", "camera dataset", "video file dataset", "MONAI", "data loader", "transforms", "OpenCV", "codec verification", "parallel processing", "dataset integrity"], "summary_hash": "909b7806dcc2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:22:08+00:00"}
