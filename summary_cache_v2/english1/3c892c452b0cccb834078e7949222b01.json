{"summary": "The module provides a collection of spatial preprocessing utilities for converting between raster and vector formats, managing cell‑based tables, and performing zonal aggregations. It includes helpers for rasterizing geometries, polygonizing raster data, rounding extents, handling data types, and interpolating values, with optional Dask support for parallel computation.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient preparation and transformation of geospatial datasets for downstream modeling or analysis workflows, such as environmental or hydrological simulations.", "keywords": ["rasterization", "polygonization", "zonal aggregation", "cell table", "spatial preprocessing", "Dask", "GDAL", "NumPy", "interpolation", "geospatial analysis"], "summary_hash": "8f882778543c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:45:50+00:00"}
