{"summary": "The module implements utilities for calculating the graph edit distance between two DGL graphs. It defines data structures for search tree nodes, constructs various cost matrices, and provides algorithms such as A* search and assignment-based matching to evaluate the minimum edit operations required to transform one graph into another.", "business_intent": "Enable quantitative comparison of graph-structured data, supporting tasks like pattern matching, similarity assessment, and anomaly detection in domains such as chemistry, social networks, or computer vision.", "keywords": ["graph edit distance", "graph matching", "A* search", "cost matrix", "linear assignment", "DGL", "Hausdorff", "search tree", "edit operations"], "summary_hash": "e085005eea95", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:21:33+00:00"}
