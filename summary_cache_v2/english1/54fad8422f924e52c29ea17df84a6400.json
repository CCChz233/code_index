{"summary": "Implements a Perceiver encoder that projects arbitrary input sequences into a latent space, initializes learnable latent vectors, and iteratively refines them using cross‑attention from inputs and self‑attention among latents, yielding a compact representation for downstream processing.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, modality‑agnostic encoding component for NeMo NLP models, enabling efficient handling of long or high‑dimensional inputs and supporting downstream tasks such as classification, generation, or multimodal understanding.", "keywords": ["Perceiver", "encoder", "latent representation", "cross-attention", "self-attention", "transformer", "input projection", "neural network", "PyTorch", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "1637c36a8a54", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:22:40+00:00"}
