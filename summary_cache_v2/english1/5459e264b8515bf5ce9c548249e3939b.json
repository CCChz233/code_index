{"summary": "The module defines a utility class that performs one‑to‑one, dimension‑independent conversions of atmospheric variables needed for climate indicator calculations. It manages missing data, validates inputs, and provides a consistent interface for applying unit transformations across datasets.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable and standardized unit conversions within climate data workflows, ensuring that atmospheric indicators are computed on correctly scaled variables and reducing errors caused by inconsistent units or missing values.", "keywords": ["unit conversion", "atmospheric variables", "climate indicators", "dimension‑independent", "missing data handling", "validation", "xclim", "utility class"], "summary_hash": "3045aaf00139", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:33:33+00:00"}
