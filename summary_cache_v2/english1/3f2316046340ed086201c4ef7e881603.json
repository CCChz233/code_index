{"summary": "The module provides a complete PyTorch implementation of Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) for recommendation tasks. It includes a driver that prepares interaction data, configures the model and optimizer, runs training with early stopping, and evaluates recommendation quality, as well as a model definition that builds user and item embeddings through stacked graph convolution layers, computes Bayesian Personalized Ranking loss, and predicts ratings.", "business_intent": "To showcase how to construct, train, and assess a graph‑based collaborative filtering recommender system, enabling researchers and engineers to adopt NGCF for personalized recommendation pipelines.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "NGCF", "graph convolutional network", "collaborative filtering", "recommendation system", "BPR loss", "early stopping", "training loop", "model evaluation", "user-item embeddings"], "summary_hash": "4191d55b7314", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:57:16+00:00"}
