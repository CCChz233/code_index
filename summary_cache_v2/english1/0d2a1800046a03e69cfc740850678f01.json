{"summary": "Defines a parameterized two‑local quantum circuit that conserves the total number of excitations. The circuit alternates single‑qubit Z rotations with two‑qubit XX+YY (or FSIM/iswap) interactions, supporting configurable repetitions, entanglement topology, and an optional global phase, providing a compact excitation‑preserving variational ansatz.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum‑chemistry and many‑body simulations that require particle‑number conservation by supplying a ready‑to‑use, configurable variational circuit for Qiskit‑based algorithms.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "excitation preserving", "variational ansatz", "two‑local", "parameterized", "Z rotation", "XX+YY interaction", "FSIM", "iswap", "entanglement pattern", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "5cbfb37818fb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:11:18+00:00"}
