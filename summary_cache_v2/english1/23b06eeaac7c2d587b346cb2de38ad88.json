{"summary": "The module defines a serializer class that converts unsigned integers (up to 256 bits) to and from the format required by Cairo contracts. It accepts plain integers or dictionary forms, splits values into low/high 128‑bit parts when needed, and integrates with the surrounding serialization context for both encoding and decoding.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate and efficient handling of large unsigned integers in StarkNet/Cairo data exchange, ensuring proper range validation and compatibility with contract interfaces.", "keywords": ["unsigned integer", "uint256", "serializer", "deserializer", "Cairo", "StarkNet", "serialization", "range check", "low/high components", "context"], "summary_hash": "dc7f8ad59421", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:46:29+00:00"}
