{"summary": "The module defines core components for a graph neural network based on the CARE architecture, including a convolutional layer that computes inter‑node distances, selects the top‑p nearest neighbors, and aggregates node features, as well as a lightweight wrapper that integrates these layers into a simple reinforcement‑learning model for forward inference.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to quickly build and experiment with graph‑based reinforcement learning solutions by providing reusable, efficient graph convolution and model integration utilities built on PyTorch and DGL.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "CARE architecture", "convolutional layer", "top‑p neighbor sampling", "distance computation", "node feature aggregation", "reinforcement learning", "PyTorch", "DGL", "lightweight model"], "summary_hash": "a23738714e05", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:12:39+00:00"}
