Provide English.\n\nClass: MultiLabelClassificationReport. Computes TP, FN, FP per class for multi-label dataset. Supports distributed training via all-reduce sum. Integration with PyTorch Lightning: returns TP, FN, FP in validation_step, aggregates at epoch end to compute precision, recall, f1 via get_precision_recall_f1(). Provides compute method returning aggregated metrics and report. Accepts num_classes, optional label mapping, averaging mode, distributed sync options.\n\nWe need summary: brief description of class purpose.\n\nBusiness intent: why used in business context: evaluate multi-label classification models, track performance metrics across distributed training, enable accurate reporting for model validation.\n\nKeywords: multi-label classification, precision, recall, f1, true positive, false negative, false positive, distributed training, PyTorch Lightning, metric aggregation, evaluation, report, all-reduce, validation step.\n\nMake sure not to list method names verbatim (like \"update\")?
