{"summary": "This module implements a quantum multiplication circuit that calculates the product of two quantum registers using a classical multiplication strategy. It builds the operation from a sequence of controlled, shifted additions realized with ripple‑carry adders, and outputs the result into a dedicated register.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use quantum arithmetic component for Qiskit that enables developers to incorporate integer multiplication into larger quantum algorithms, such as modular exponentiation, cryptographic primitives, and other arithmetic‑heavy quantum applications.", "keywords": ["quantum multiplication", "ripple-carry adder", "controlled addition", "quantum circuit", "Qiskit", "arithmetic library", "cumulative multiplier", "ancilla register", "quantum registers"], "summary_hash": "0378c4fdd9fd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:21:42+00:00"}
