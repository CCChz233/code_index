It encodes paper titles and abstracts using the SPECTER model to obtain vector embeddings, then leverages sentence‑transformers utilities to compute similarity scores and retrieve the most semantically related papers from the collection.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers, analysts, and knowledge‑workers to quickly discover related academic works, support literature reviews, and improve information retrieval in scientific domains.", "keywords": ["semantic search", "scientific publications", "SPECTER", "sentence-transformers", "vector embeddings", "similarity search", "title and abstract encoding", "literature retrieval", "research discovery"], "summary_hash": "4f986496d5ea", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:59:41+00:00"}
