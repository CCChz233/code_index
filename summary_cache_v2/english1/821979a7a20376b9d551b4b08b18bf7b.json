{"summary": "The module implements benchmark utilities that measure the time required to load Qiskit Pulse default configurations and to schedule quantum circuits. It defines two benchmark classes—one for timing the construction of PulseDefaults objects and another for timing the circuit scheduling process—along with a helper function to generate a sample quantum circuit.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to assess and optimize the performance of the Qiskit pulse control stack and circuit scheduling components by providing precise timing measurements for loading pulse defaults and scheduling operations.", "keywords": ["benchmark", "performance", "timing", "Qiskit", "PulseDefaults", "circuit scheduling", "quantum circuit", "pulse control", "load defaults", "execution time"], "summary_hash": "5baf510e5b9c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:36:39+00:00"}
