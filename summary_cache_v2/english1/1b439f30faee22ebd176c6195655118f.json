{"summary": "A configuration container that holds all hyper‑parameters defining the architecture and training behavior of a SEW‑D speech model, including transformer dimensions, convolutional feature extractor settings, attention mechanisms, dropout rates, data augmentation, and loss options. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration to enable easy model instantiation and serialization.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to specify, share, and reproduce the exact setup of a SEW‑D speech recognition model for training, fine‑tuning, or inference, thereby simplifying model deployment and experimentation.", "keywords": ["configuration", "speech model", "SEW-D", "transformer", "convolutional feature extractor", "relative position encoding", "SpecAugment", "dropout", "hyperparameters", "pretrained"], "summary_hash": "1731f5db93a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:15:13+00:00"}
