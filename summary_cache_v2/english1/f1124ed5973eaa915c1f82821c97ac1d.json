It provides a straightforward, inspectable mapping for shift/reduce decisions during syntax analysis, trading performance for clarity.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to debug and understand parser behavior by offering a transparent, easily examined parse table structure, useful during parser development and troubleshooting.", "keywords": ["parse table", "parser state", "rule pointer", "debugging", "syntax analysis", "compiler", "grammar", "lookup", "shift/reduce"], "summary_hash": "e6a35609a996", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:14:19+00:00"}
