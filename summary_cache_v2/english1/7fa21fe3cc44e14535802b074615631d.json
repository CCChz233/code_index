{"summary": "The module supplies utilities for converting between map or geographic coordinates in a given coordinate reference system and raster pixel locations. It defines a generic transformer interface, a no‑op implementation for cases where no conversion is needed, and a rasterio‑based implementation that leverages a dataset’s affine matrix and CRS to perform forward and inverse transformations, including reprojection when required.", "business_intent": "Facilitate accurate spatial alignment of raster imagery within geospatial workflows, allowing downstream analysis, visualization, and machine‑learning models to reference pixel data using real‑world coordinates and to handle datasets with differing CRS seamlessly.", "keywords": ["CRS", "coordinate transformation", "raster", "affine", "pixel index", "reprojection", "rasterio", "map coordinates", "geographic coordinates", "identity transformer"], "summary_hash": "b8fdbb28a439", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:04:59+00:00"}
