{"summary": "A small module defining helper functions to check whether an array is complex, real, or Fortran‑contiguous. All functions are currently unused and not covered by tests, effectively making the code dead or placeholder.", "business_intent": "Originally intended to provide simple type‑checking utilities for CuPy/NumPy arrays (complex vs real, Fortran order) to be used elsewhere in the library, but they are not integrated into the codebase.", "keywords": ["type checking", "complex", "real", "Fortran order", "utility functions", "dead code", "placeholder"], "summary_hash": "0e9568cf14d4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:21:47+00:00"}
