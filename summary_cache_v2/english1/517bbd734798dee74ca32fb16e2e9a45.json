{"summary": "The module defines a model class that orchestrates the fine‑tuning of a T5 sequence‑to‑sequence language model using the Megatron framework. It builds and loads datasets, configures distributed data loaders, runs training, validation, testing, and inference steps, and computes relevant NLP metrics, all within the NeMo ecosystem.", "business_intent": "Enable enterprises and researchers to efficiently adapt large T5 models for custom NLP tasks such as translation, summarization, or text generation on multi‑GPU or multi‑node clusters, reducing development time and resource consumption.", "keywords": ["T5", "Megatron", "fine-tuning", "language model", "sequence-to-sequence", "distributed training", "NeMo", "NLP", "metrics", "inference", "data loading"], "summary_hash": "5b9157305621", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:35:55+00:00"}
