{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests that validate the behavior of various analysis helper functions used in the health system simulation framework. The tests cover log file parsing and merging, color mapping for causes of death and appointment types, retrieval of parameter sets for different scenarios, handling of file paths, and utilities for flattening and unflattening multi‑index data structures. By exercising these utilities with simulated runs and synthetic data, the test suite ensures that the analysis layer correctly processes simulation outputs and supports downstream reporting and visualization.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of the analysis toolkit that processes simulation logs, generates visualizations, and configures scenario parameters, thereby enabling reliable health system modeling and decision‑support reporting.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "analysis utilities", "log parsing", "log merging", "color mapping", "scenario configuration", "health system simulation", "data flattening", "pandas", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "d15689b17bc2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:42:46+00:00"}
