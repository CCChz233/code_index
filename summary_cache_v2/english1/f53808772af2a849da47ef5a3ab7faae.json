{"summary": "The module demonstrates a best‑practice pipeline for large‑scale semantic search that quantizes sentence embeddings, builds a binary index for rapid candidate retrieval, and then rescues the top results with int8‑quantized embeddings using FAISS or USearch, delivering major memory and latency reductions while preserving retrieval quality.", "business_intent": "Provide a cost‑effective, high‑throughput solution for organizations to perform semantic search over massive text corpora by exploiting embedding quantization techniques to lower storage, memory, and compute requirements.", "keywords": ["embedding quantization", "binary quantization", "int8 scalar quantization", "semantic search", "FAISS", "USearch", "retrieval", "rescoring", "memory reduction", "speedup", "large‑scale retrieval"], "summary_hash": "76dcda29c60d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:59:52+00:00"}
