{"summary": "Provides the main transpile function that compiles and optimizes quantum circuits for a given backend. It validates inputs, converts circuits to DAG form, selects and runs a preset pass manager based on the target device, and applies configuration options such as coupling maps, initial layouts, instruction durations, and timing constraints, returning hardware‑compatible circuits with associated metadata.", "business_intent": "Automate the conversion of high‑level quantum algorithms into efficient, hardware‑ready circuits, minimizing manual compilation effort and ensuring correct execution on quantum processors.", "keywords": ["transpile", "quantum circuit", "compilation", "optimization", "backend", "coupling map", "layout", "instruction durations", "timing constraints", "pass manager", "target"], "summary_hash": "77a74b110130", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:51:18+00:00"}
