{"summary": "Test suite for the automatic speech recognition (ASR) confidence evaluation package, covering end‑to‑end benchmarking, metric calculations, and primitive utilities. The tests verify compatibility with legacy configurations, execution on CTC and RNNT conformer models, correctness of confidence scores under various prediction scenarios, and generation of visual calibration artifacts.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that ASR confidence tools produce accurate, calibrated scores across model types and configurations, supporting reliable downstream decision‑making and maintaining backward compatibility for existing deployments.", "keywords": ["ASR", "confidence", "benchmarking", "metrics", "calibration", "CTC", "RNNT", "conformer", "unit testing", "visualization", "aggregation", "compatibility"], "summary_hash": "fb90da25b253", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:55:01+00:00"}
