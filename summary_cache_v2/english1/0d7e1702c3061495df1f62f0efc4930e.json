{"summary": "This module defines a Triton GPU kernel that applies rotary positional embeddings to padded tensors, intended for use in transformer operations. The kernel function is currently not referenced elsewhere in the codebase and lacks test coverage.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑performance GPU implementation of rotary positional embedding handling for padded sequences to accelerate transformer models.", "keywords": ["Triton", "GPU kernel", "rotary positional embedding", "padding", "transformer", "xformers", "performance"], "summary_hash": "bfe0da0c46a5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:32:36+00:00"}
