{"summary": "The module defines engine classes that coordinate the evaluation phase of deep learning models in MONAI. It handles data loading, batch preparation, model inference (including ensemble inference across multiple networks), optional post‑processing, metric aggregation, mixed‑precision support, event triggering, and checkpointing, ultimately returning predictions and evaluation statistics for analysis.", "business_intent": "To give medical imaging researchers and developers a reusable, configurable component for validating and testing models—both single and ensemble—so they can reliably assess performance, track metrics, and integrate evaluation seamlessly into training pipelines.", "keywords": ["evaluation", "validation", "inference", "ensemble", "metrics", "PyTorch", "MONAI", "data loader", "post‑processing", "mixed precision", "checkpointing", "event handling"], "summary_hash": "a845cbb16af3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:28:59+00:00"}
