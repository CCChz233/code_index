{"summary": "The module processes CORSIKA IACT simulation files to produce a comprehensive set of 1‑D and 2‑D histograms describing Cherenkov photon distributions (position, direction, wavelength, time, altitude, etc.) and optional event‑header parameters. It allows selection of specific telescopes, individual or combined histograms, configurable binning, and can export results as PDF visualisations and/or HDF5 datasets.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers to analyse and visualise atmospheric Cherenkov telescope simulation outputs by automatically generating and storing detailed photon distribution histograms, facilitating scientific studies of detector performance and astrophysical observations.", "keywords": ["CORSIKA", "IACT", "Cherenkov photons", "histograms", "PDF", "HDF5", "simulation analysis", "telescope selection", "data visualization", "event header"], "summary_hash": "6c8497fa3dbd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:51:10+00:00"}
