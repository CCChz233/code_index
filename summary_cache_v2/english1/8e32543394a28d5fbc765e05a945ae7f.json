{"summary": "This module implements the core infrastructure for constructing and analysing a control‑flow graph within the Cython compiler. It defines data structures for basic blocks, assignments, loops, exception handling, name references and type information, provides visitors to collect assignments from the AST, performs data‑flow analysis (reaching definitions, variable liveness, etc.), manages the current flow state, aggregates diagnostic messages, and includes utilities to render the graph via Graphviz.", "business_intent": "To give the Cython compiler a precise model of program execution paths so it can generate correct C code, perform type inference, detect unreachable or erroneous code, and enable optimisation and debugging support.", "keywords": ["control flow graph", "basic block", "data flow analysis", "assignment tracking", "loop description", "exception handling", "name reference", "type inference", "compiler diagnostics", "graphviz visualization", "Cython compilation"], "summary_hash": "f61e3d63b124", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:27:57+00:00"}
