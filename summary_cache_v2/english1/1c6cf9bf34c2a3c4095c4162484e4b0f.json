{"summary": "Implements a multi‑scale PatchGAN discriminator that evaluates images at several spatial resolutions. It builds a stack of convolutional sub‑discriminators, each deeper than the previous, progressively halving the spatial size, and aggregates their outputs to provide a comprehensive adversarial loss for high‑resolution image synthesis.", "business_intent": "Provides a robust adversarial component for training conditional GANs that generate or manipulate high‑resolution images, enabling applications such as photo‑realistic synthesis, style transfer, and semantic image editing.", "keywords": ["multi‑scale", "PatchGAN", "discriminator", "convolutional neural network", "GAN", "high‑resolution image synthesis", "conditional GAN", "Pix2PixHD", "deep learning", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "207a918d12ed", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:39:37+00:00"}
