{"summary": "The module implements a utility that manages all aspects of checkpoint handling for Lightning training runs. It discovers existing checkpoints, supports versioned files and HPC resume paths, and coordinates the loading and saving of model, optimizer, scheduler, callbacks, data module, loop, and precision plugin states across local and remote filesystems.", "business_intent": "Enable robust, fault‑tolerant training workflows by providing seamless checkpoint creation, version control, and restoration capabilities, allowing users to resume experiments, recover from failures, and maintain reproducibility in large‑scale deep learning projects.", "keywords": ["checkpoint", "serialization", "deserialization", "versioning", "resume", "HPC", "model state", "optimizer state", "scheduler state", "callbacks", "data module", "training loops", "precision plugin", "Lightning", "PyTorch", "filesystem", "cloud storage"], "summary_hash": "368d5d0be4c9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:00:37+00:00"}
