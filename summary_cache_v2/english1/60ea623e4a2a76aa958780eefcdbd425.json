{"summary": "The module implements a collection of image blur augmentation operations, each generating and applying different types of blur kernels or pixel shuffling to simulate realistic visual degradations. It also defines validation schemas to ensure augmentation parameters are within acceptable ranges.", "business_intent": "To enrich training datasets for computer vision models by programmatically introducing diverse blur effects, thereby enhancing model robustness to out‑of‑distribution visual noise and improving generalization.", "keywords": ["blur augmentation", "image processing", "convolution kernel", "Gaussian blur", "defocus blur", "motion blur", "median filter", "glass blur", "zoom blur", "parameter validation", "data augmentation", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "5f98f769c141", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:28:14+00:00"}
