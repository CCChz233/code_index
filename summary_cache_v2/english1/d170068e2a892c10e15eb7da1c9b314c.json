{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests that validate the integration of Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) within the Lightning framework. It defines lightweight test models and exercises various aspects of the FSDP strategy, including model wrapping, optimizer configuration, checkpoint saving and loading, mixed‑precision handling, sharding configurations, and error conditions.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that the FSDP strategy works correctly for large‑scale distributed training, ensuring reliable checkpointing, precision management, and resource handling, thereby supporting robust production‑grade machine learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["Fully Sharded Data Parallel", "Lightning", "distributed training", "checkpointing", "auto wrapping", "mixed precision", "sharding strategy", "CPU offload", "optimizer", "unit testing", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "4987b6b5cea3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:33:25+00:00"}
