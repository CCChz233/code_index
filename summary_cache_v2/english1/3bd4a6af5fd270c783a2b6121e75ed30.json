{"summary": "The module defines a core Inferer abstraction and a collection of concrete inferer implementations that manage model execution for medical imaging tasks. It handles input preprocessing, device placement, batch handling, and result aggregation, offering strategies such as whole‑image, sliding‑window, patch‑wise, slice‑wise, diffusion‑based, latent diffusion, control‑net conditioning, and saliency map generation.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, memory‑efficient inference framework for MONAI users to deploy deep learning models on large 3D medical images, support advanced generative diffusion pipelines, and enable visual explanation of model predictions.", "keywords": ["inference", "sliding window", "patch-based", "slice-wise", "diffusion model", "latent diffusion", "control net", "saliency map", "medical imaging", "MONAI", "model execution", "batch processing", "device placement", "result merging", "likelihood estimation", "sample generation"], "summary_hash": "2bdd90f3802b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:07:07+00:00"}
