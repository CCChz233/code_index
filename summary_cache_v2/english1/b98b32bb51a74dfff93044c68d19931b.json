{"summary": "This module contains a suite of tests and helper utilities that validate the behavior of DGL's distributed data loaders under multiprocessing. It exercises neighbor sampling, node/edge/negative sampling, and multiple concurrent loaders on partitioned graphs, ensuring correct data partitioning, sampling logic, and inter-process coordination.", "business_intent": "Verify that distributed graph data loading mechanisms function reliably for large‑scale graph neural network training, enabling scalable, parallel processing of graph data across multiple machines or GPUs.", "keywords": ["distributed", "data loader", "multiprocessing", "graph neural network", "neighbor sampling", "negative sampling", "partitioned graph", "DGL", "scalability", "testing"], "summary_hash": "3fbeba798318", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:06:48+00:00"}
