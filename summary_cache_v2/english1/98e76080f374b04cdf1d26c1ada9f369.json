{"summary": "The module contains automated unit tests that exercise the H.264 video codec integration, including parsing of RTP payload descriptors, handling of fragmented and aggregated NAL units, and end-to-end encoding/decoding pipelines. It provides test contexts for fragmented data, validates descriptor edge cases, and checks bitrate, frame ordering, and bitstream splitting across various resolutions.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the H.264 codec implementation complies with RTP standards and works reliably in real-time communication scenarios, preventing regressions and guaranteeing correct video packetization, transmission, and reconstruction.", "keywords": ["H264", "RTP", "payload descriptor", "unit testing", "encoding", "decoding", "fragmentation", "aggregation", "bitrate", "video codec", "aiortc", "jitter buffer", "packetization"], "summary_hash": "613143746734", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:43:08+00:00"}
