{"summary": "DistCall is a decorator class that transforms a unittest test method into a distributed test, launching multiple processes (and optionally multiple nodes) that run under torch.distributed. It handles process spawning, master address configuration, and rank assignment so that the test logic can branch based on the current distributed rank.", "business_intent": "Provide a simple way to execute unit tests in a distributed PyTorch environment, enabling developers to validate code that relies on torch.distributed across several processes or machines without manual setup.", "keywords": ["distributed testing", "torch.distributed", "unittest decorator", "multi‑process", "multi‑node", "rank handling", "master address", "process spawning"], "summary_hash": "b164d791dda7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:39:32+00:00"}
