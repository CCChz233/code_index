{"summary": "SegResNetDS is a 3‑D convolutional neural network designed for brain tumor segmentation in MRI volumes. It builds on a residual encoder‑decoder architecture, adds deep‑supervision outputs at multiple scales, and can optionally preprocess inputs with anisotropic kernels to normalize voxel spacing before isotropic processing.", "business_intent": "Enable automated, high‑accuracy tumor delineation to support radiology workflows, clinical decision‑making, and research studies that require fast, reproducible segmentation of brain MRI scans.", "keywords": ["brain tumor segmentation", "3D MRI", "deep supervision", "anisotropic kernels", "autoencoder regularization", "residual encoder-decoder", "medical imaging AI", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "11be4fa2de2d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:43:19+00:00"}
