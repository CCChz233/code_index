{"summary": "Command‑line utility that calibrates CTA telescope optical models by fitting mirror‑alignment parameters to a measured cumulative PSF curve. It loads telescope specifications, reads PSF data, generates random combinations of reflection and alignment jitter parameters, runs ray‑tracing simulations, evaluates the root‑mean‑square deviation between simulated and observed PSF, and reports the parameter set with the lowest deviation, optionally producing diagnostic plots.", "business_intent": "Enable precise optical performance tuning and maintenance of Cherenkov telescopes by automating the derivation of mirror alignment settings from empirical PSF measurements.", "keywords": ["point spread function", "mirror alignment", "random parameter search", "RMSD optimization", "ray tracing", "telescope calibration", "CTA", "simulation fitting", "command line tool", "visualization"], "summary_hash": "c60d3a0f3450", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:50:57+00:00"}
