{"summary": "PositionalSharding encapsulates the metadata describing how an array is partitioned across multiple devices using positional indices. It offers utilities to query device assignments, replication status, shape and dimensionality, memory characteristics, and to transform the sharding layout (e.g., reshape, transpose) or convert it to other sharding representations used by different back‑ends.", "business_intent": "Provide a unified abstraction for managing data distribution in large‑scale, high‑performance machine learning workloads, enabling efficient device utilization, interoperability with various execution engines, and streamlined optimization of distributed tensor operations.", "keywords": ["sharding", "device placement", "tensor distribution", "replication", "reshape", "transpose", "memory kind", "compatibility", "XLA", "SDY", "distributed computing"], "summary_hash": "87edeb02e3a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:26:32+00:00"}
