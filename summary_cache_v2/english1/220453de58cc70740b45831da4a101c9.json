{"summary": "Encapsulates the complete state of a single DGL server responsible for a graph partition, including the sub‑graph structure, node and edge feature tensors, partition metadata, and a reference to the key‑value store. It can be configured to store only data or only structure and is designed for serialization and shared‑memory access between a master server and its backup/client processes.", "business_intent": "Provides a centralized, shared‑memory compatible container that enables efficient distributed graph computation by allowing multiple processes to access and update partition‑specific data and topology, supporting heterogeneous server roles and scalable training/inference on large graphs.", "keywords": ["distributed graph processing", "graph partition", "shared memory", "node features", "edge features", "KV store", "master-backup", "heterogeneous server roles", "serialization", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "24cc5db2ef75", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:43:39+00:00"}
