{"summary": "The module defines an example Stable Diffusion XL based pipeline that generates high‑resolution images from text prompts and optional source images. It manages latent encoding, differential denoising, and decoding while exposing parameters such as guidance scale, timesteps, and adapter configurations. Helper utilities for noise scaling are also included.", "business_intent": "Offer developers a reference implementation for building or extending advanced image‑to‑image generation workflows with Stable Diffusion XL, demonstrating how to combine textual prompts, source images, and adapter mechanisms for customized diffusion outputs.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion xl", "image-to-image generation", "differential diffusion", "pipeline example", "latent encoding", "denoising", "guidance scale", "adapters", "LoRA integration", "text-to-image"], "summary_hash": "b5a4fa65208e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:03:06+00:00"}
