{"summary": "Implements a NeMo ASR model that ensembles several speech‑recognition models and computes confidence scores for the transcriptions. It provides a specification class to translate confidence‑related settings into a configuration object and integrates with NeMo’s confidence utilities to aggregate logits, apply confidence methods, and output both the decoded text and associated confidence measures.", "business_intent": "Enable applications to achieve more accurate and reliable speech‑to‑text results by leveraging model ensembles and confidence estimation, allowing downstream systems to make informed decisions based on the certainty of transcriptions.", "keywords": ["ASR", "ensemble", "confidence estimation", "speech recognition", "NeMo", "model aggregation", "hybrid RNNT-CTC", "PyTorch Lightning", "audio processing", "inference"], "summary_hash": "50f8df2a1cc9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:11:13+00:00"}
