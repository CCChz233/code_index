{"summary": "Provides a foundational interface for calculating performance metrics on a per‑iteration (mini‑batch) basis. It accepts model predictions and optional targets supplied as tensors or as collections of tensors, normalizes the input, and delegates the actual numeric computation to subclass‑implemented logic. Helper utilities streamline processing of list‑based inputs and tensor‑based inputs.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to plug in custom evaluation metrics that operate on each training step, facilitating real‑time monitoring and analysis of model behavior during batch processing.", "keywords": ["iteration metric", "mini‑batch", "tensor computation", "model evaluation", "PyTorch", "extensible base class", "batch‑level metric", "custom metric"], "summary_hash": "95239119247b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:24:13+00:00"}
