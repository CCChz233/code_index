{"summary": "Provides a transpiler pass that rewrites a quantum circuit so that every parameterized operation is expressed in a user‑specified basis. The pass recursively expands unsupported parameterized gates—including those inside nested sub‑circuits—using internal utilities that convert instructions to DAG form and test for parameterization or basis support, until only allowed parameterized gates remain or no further decomposition is possible.", "business_intent": "Allows quantum programs containing arbitrary parameterized gates to be run on back‑ends with a limited native gate set by automatically translating unsupported parameterized operations into equivalent sequences of supported ones, preserving circuit semantics and parameter values.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "parameterized gate translation", "basis decomposition", "transpiler pass", "recursive expansion", "gate synthesis", "Qiskit", "hardware compatibility", "DAG conversion", "gate support detection"], "summary_hash": "802352c53c65", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:27:23+00:00"}
