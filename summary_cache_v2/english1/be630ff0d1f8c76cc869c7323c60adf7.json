{"summary": "A configurable 2‑D UNet implemented in Flax that takes a noisy image tensor, a conditioning representation, and a diffusion timestep, processes them through stacked down‑sampling, cross‑attention, and up‑sampling blocks, and outputs a denoised image tensor of the same spatial shape.", "business_intent": "Serves as the core denoising network for conditional diffusion pipelines (e.g., Stable Diffusion), enabling generation of images or other data conditioned on text or auxiliary signals.", "keywords": ["UNet", "conditional diffusion", "Flax", "JAX", "cross‑attention", "time embedding", "image generation", "latent diffusion", "stable diffusion", "neural network", "downsampling", "upsampling", "memory efficient attention"], "summary_hash": "5a93470aba16", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:30:37+00:00"}
