{"summary": "Defines an abstract base class that encapsulates the behavior of a hardware accelerator within Lightning Fabric. It provides a unified API for discovering devices, counting them, verifying availability, registering the accelerator type, and managing its lifecycle during parallel execution.", "business_intent": "Enable framework users to write device‑agnostic training code by offering a consistent interface for different accelerators (CPU, GPU, TPU, etc.), thereby simplifying hardware selection, scaling, and integration with Lightning's parallel execution engine.", "keywords": ["accelerator", "hardware abstraction", "device discovery", "device count", "availability verification", "registration", "lifecycle management", "parallel execution", "Lightning Fabric", "abstract base class", "torch"], "summary_hash": "3348785c7f19", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:04:51+00:00"}
