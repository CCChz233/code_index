{"summary": "The module establishes a unified interface for converting text into dense vector embeddings and implements adapters for several popular embedding providers (Hugging Face models, LangChain embeddings, LlamaIndex embeddings). It defines an abstract base class that manages configuration, retry logic, and asynchronous execution, and supplies a factory routine that selects and creates the appropriate concrete implementation based on user settings.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, plug‑in architecture that lets the Ragas evaluation framework obtain high‑quality text embeddings from different AI models without changing downstream code, thereby supporting scalable similarity and relevance assessments.", "keywords": ["embeddings", "vector representation", "text encoding", "Hugging Face", "LangChain", "LlamaIndex", "asynchronous", "factory pattern", "configuration", "retry", "OpenAI", "sentence transformer", "cross encoder"], "summary_hash": "52911d570b61", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:49:25+00:00"}
