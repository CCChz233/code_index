{"summary": "This module implements Dask-compatible rolling window operations for DataFrames and Series. It provides classes that mirror pandas' Rolling and RollingGroupby interfaces, handling partition alignment, overlap management, and lazy graph construction so that statistical calculations over moving windows can be executed in parallel across a Dask cluster.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient, scalable computation of window-based metrics (e.g., moving averages, sums, min/max) on large distributed datasets, extending pandas-like rolling functionality to Dask's parallel, out-of-core environment and supporting grouped rolling analyses.", "keywords": ["dask", "dataframe", "rolling window", "moving statistics", "parallel computation", "partition overlap", "groupby", "lazy evaluation", "pandas compatibility", "distributed processing"], "summary_hash": "c584fa6b5099", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:20:29+00:00"}
