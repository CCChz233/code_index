{"summary": "This module provides a suite of unit tests that validate various similarity and distance calculations on vector embeddings, including cosine, dot product, Euclidean, and Manhattan metrics, as well as functions for normalizing embeddings, computing pairwise similarities, paraphrase mining, and semantic search. The tests ensure that the underlying utility functions behave correctly across different libraries such as NumPy, PyTorch, and Sentence‑Transformers.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the accuracy and reliability of embedding similarity operations that power NLP features like semantic search, paraphrase detection, and recommendation systems, thereby supporting robust downstream applications.", "keywords": ["similarity", "cosine similarity", "dot product", "euclidean distance", "manhattan distance", "embedding normalization", "pairwise similarity", "paraphrase mining", "semantic search", "unit tests", "numpy", "torch", "sentence-transformers"], "summary_hash": "86cff98cd8ab", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:49:42+00:00"}
