It loads ignore patterns from configuration files, normalizes and matches paths, and provides callable objects and filters to decide whether a given file or directory should be excluded from DVC tracking. It also offers utilities for listing and walking repository contents while respecting those ignore rules.", "business_intent": "Enable DVC to respect user-defined ignore rules (e.g., .dvcignore) so that unwanted files are omitted from data versioning operations, improving repository cleanliness and performance.", "keywords": ["DVC", "ignore", "patterns", ".dvcignore", "file filtering", "path matching", "repository traversal", "exclusion", "version control", "filesystem"], "summary_hash": "16a0a351e1c3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:09:32+00:00"}
