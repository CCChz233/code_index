{"summary": "The module implements a flexible pipeline for converting raw datasets into various model‑specific fine‑tuning schemas and persisting them in common storage formats. It defines abstract interfaces for formatting data (e.g., aligning columns, renaming fields) and for exporting datasets (e.g., writing JSONL or Parquet files). Concrete implementations handle Hugging Face datasets, OpenAI chat and completion formats, and provide utilities for evaluation‑oriented transformations.", "business_intent": "To streamline the preparation of training and evaluation data for different AI model providers by automating schema adaptation and file export, reducing manual preprocessing effort and ensuring compatibility with fine‑tuning APIs.", "keywords": ["dataset conversion", "data formatter", "exporter", "JSONL", "Parquet", "OpenAI chat", "OpenAI completion", "Hugging Face", "fine‑tuning", "schema mapping", "evaluation dataset"], "summary_hash": "201177d53ca5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:38:01+00:00"}
