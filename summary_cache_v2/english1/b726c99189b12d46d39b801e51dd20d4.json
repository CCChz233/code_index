{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests that verify the correct behavior of padding mechanisms during data collation in MONAI. It defines a mock dataset, a simple collate helper, and multiple test cases that exercise PadListDataCollate with various transforms, data loaders, and deterministic settings to ensure that variable‑size inputs are properly padded and that inverse transforms restore original data.", "business_intent": "Validate and guarantee reliable preprocessing of medical imaging data by ensuring that batch collation with padding works correctly, which is essential for downstream training and inference pipelines that depend on consistent tensor shapes.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "padding", "collation", "MONAI", "data loader", "transforms", "batch processing", "medical imaging", "determinism", "random augmentation"], "summary_hash": "a7fc9e6c4e6b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:02:36+00:00"}
