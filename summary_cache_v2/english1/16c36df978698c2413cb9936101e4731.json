{"summary": "Encapsulates the QM9 molecular dataset as a collection of DGL graphs where nodes represent atoms and edges represent chemical bonds. Each graph includes 3D atom coordinates, atom feature vectors, and bond feature vectors, and is associated with up to 19 quantum‑chemical regression targets. The class handles downloading, caching, preprocessing, and loading of the data, supports optional selection of target properties, and allows user‑defined graph transformations.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use, feature‑rich molecular graph dataset for training and evaluating graph neural network models on quantum chemistry property prediction tasks.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "molecular dataset", "QM9", "edge features", "bond representation", "regression targets", "quantum chemistry", "DGL", "data preprocessing", "property prediction"], "summary_hash": "5533c5b4e616", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:43:50+00:00"}
