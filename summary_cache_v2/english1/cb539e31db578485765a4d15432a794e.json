{"summary": "Implements a recursive‑descent parser for High Level Shader Language (HLSL) source. It consumes token streams from the accompanying lexer, recognizes language constructs (functions, statements, expressions, structs, declarations) and assembles them into an abstract syntax tree for further analysis or code generation.", "business_intent": "Facilitates automated processing and conversion of DirectX HLSL shaders, supporting tools that need to analyze, transform, or translate shader code to other graphics APIs.", "keywords": ["HLSL", "parser", "recursive descent", "lexer", "abstract syntax tree", "shader", "DirectX", "code translation", "shader analysis"], "summary_hash": "b8bc8a3976ed", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:39:24+00:00"}
