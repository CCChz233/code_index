{"summary": "The module provides a framework for converting continuous diffusion noise levels (sigmas) into discrete bins. It defines an abstract discretization interface and concrete implementations for the EDM and legacy DDPM schemes, handling sigma schedule creation, configuration, and read‑only access. Additionally, it includes a utility to produce approximately equally spaced diffusion steps.", "business_intent": "Enable stable diffusion models to map continuous noise schedules to discrete timesteps, facilitating efficient sampling and training across different diffusion algorithms.", "keywords": ["discretization", "diffusion models", "sigma schedule", "EDM", "DDPM", "stable diffusion", "noise levels", "step generation", "torch", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "fb5dee871261", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:02:52+00:00"}
