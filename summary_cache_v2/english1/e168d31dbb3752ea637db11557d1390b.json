{"summary": "Implements a high‑performance transition map used by the Plex lexer, storing state sets as dictionaries keyed by input symbols (character ranges, epsilon, line‑boundary markers) and mapping them to collections of automaton states. Includes a small utility for formatting state sets.", "business_intent": "Provide a fast, memory‑efficient data structure for lexical analyzer generators to resolve state transitions during tokenization.", "keywords": ["transition map", "state set", "lexer", "automaton", "character range", "epsilon transition", "line start", "line end", "file end", "Cython", "performance"], "summary_hash": "7a92056ae757", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:28:53+00:00"}
