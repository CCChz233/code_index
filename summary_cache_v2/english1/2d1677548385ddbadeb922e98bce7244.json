{"summary": "The module defines adapter‑enhanced wrappers for core TTS components such as alignment encoders, transformer encoders/decoders, and temporal predictors. These wrappers manage the integration, configuration, activation, and availability of lightweight adapter layers, enabling parameter‑efficient modifications while preserving the original model architecture.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient fine‑tuning and domain adaptation of text‑to‑speech models by providing a plug‑in mechanism for adapter modules that can be added, configured, and toggled without altering the base network.", "keywords": ["adapter", "text-to-speech", "alignment encoder", "transformer encoder", "transformer decoder", "temporal predictor", "fine-tuning", "domain adaptation", "parameter-efficient training", "model extension"], "summary_hash": "77f4f4cb1c7e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:54:16+00:00"}
