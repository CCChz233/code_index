{"summary": "Implements a configurable encoder‑decoder network based on the UNet architecture enhanced with residual blocks. The model constructs a series of down‑sampling stages that reduce spatial resolution via strided convolutions, captures intermediate feature maps for skip connections, and mirrors them with up‑sampling stages using transposed convolutions. Residual units automatically align channel dimensions using a convolutional shortcut or identity mapping. Users can customize spatial dimensionality, channel counts, stride patterns, kernel sizes, number of residual units, activation functions, normalization layers, dropout rates, bias usage, and layer ordering, making the network adaptable to various input sizes and tasks.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible deep‑learning backbone for segmentation and other pixel‑wise prediction tasks, particularly in medical imaging, where multi‑scale feature extraction and efficient training are essential.", "keywords": ["UNet", "residual blocks", "encoder‑decoder", "skip connections", "down‑sampling", "up‑sampling", "convolution", "transpose convolution", "configurable architecture", "medical imaging", "segmentation", "PyTorch", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "1a4837ec0d95", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:19:18+00:00"}
