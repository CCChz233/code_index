{"summary": "The module provides a reference implementation of graph neural network models for digit classification on the MNIST dataset. It constructs grid‑graph representations of images, defines two GNN architectures (one using Chebyshev polynomial convolutions and another using a lightweight MoNet layer), and includes the full data loading, training, and evaluation pipeline using PyTorch and DGL.", "business_intent": "Showcase how to apply geometric deep learning techniques to standard image data, offering developers a ready‑to‑run example for building and benchmarking graph‑based classifiers with DGL and PyTorch.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "DGL", "graph neural network", "Chebyshev convolution", "MoNet", "MNIST", "image classification", "geometric deep learning", "grid graph", "training script"], "summary_hash": "11aecf20f2a4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:27:43+00:00"}
