{"summary": "The module implements a command‑line tool for evaluating lesion segmentation models. It loads predictions, applies size‑based filtering to remove small connected components, computes performance metrics (including custom AUC), and can generate ROC plots. It also provides functions to run inference on a dataset and to orchestrate an experiment workflow, handling configuration, post‑processing, and result reporting.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and clinicians to assess and improve automated lesion detection pipelines by filtering out spurious detections, measuring accuracy, and visualising ROC curves, thereby supporting model validation and selection in medical imaging applications.", "keywords": ["lesion segmentation", "filtering", "connected components", "size threshold", "ROC", "AUC", "metrics", "inference", "experiment", "post‑processing", "neuroimaging"], "summary_hash": "8d37b72b09dd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:30:09+00:00"}
