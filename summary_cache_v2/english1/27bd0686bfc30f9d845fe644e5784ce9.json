{"summary": "This module implements a diffusion scheduler based on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). It defines the configuration, beta schedule computation, timestep handling, and the step logic that updates noisy samples toward the original data distribution. It also provides utilities for beta generation and signal-to-noise ratio rescaling, and a lightweight output container for scheduler steps.", "business_intent": "To supply a reliable, configurable scheduler component for generative AI pipelines that use diffusion processes, enabling efficient and high‑quality image synthesis and related tasks in production environments.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "DDPM", "scheduler", "beta schedule", "timestep", "noise prediction", "generative AI", "image synthesis", "PyTorch", "Karras diffusion"], "summary_hash": "b1f125fad945", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:13:51+00:00"}
