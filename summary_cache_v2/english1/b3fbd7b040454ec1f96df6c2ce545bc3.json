{"summary": "A foundational class that encapsulates generic execution‑control operations such as running, stepping, continuing, breakpoint management and output filtering, while delegating language‑specific details to a LanguageInfo implementation. It stores the command name and offers helper methods used by concrete language‑specific subclasses.", "business_intent": "Supply a reusable base for building language‑specific execution control commands in debugging or code‑execution tools, ensuring consistent handling of run/continue, step, breakpoint installation/removal, and output processing across different programming languages.", "keywords": ["execution control", "debugger", "breakpoint management", "step execution", "run command", "continue command", "output filtering", "LanguageInfo interface", "base class", "command abstraction"], "summary_hash": "935550ea12bb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:40:41+00:00"}
