{"summary": "This module defines automated tests for the ShapE image‑to‑image generation pipeline. It includes a fast test suite that uses lightweight dummy models to quickly verify core functionalities such as inference precision, batch processing, prompt‑to‑image count, model serialization, and CPU offloading. An integration test suite runs the full pipeline with real pretrained components to validate end‑to‑end behavior on GPU hardware.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness, performance, and robustness of the ShapE image‑to‑image generation service, enabling reliable deployment of AI‑driven 3D shape creation from visual inputs.", "keywords": ["ShapE", "image-to-image", "pipeline testing", "unit tests", "integration tests", "diffusers", "PyTorch", "model serialization", "CPU offload", "batch inference", "dummy components"], "summary_hash": "d000d6dd7c6a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:49:50+00:00"}
