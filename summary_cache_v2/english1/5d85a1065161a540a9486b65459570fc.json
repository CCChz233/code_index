{"summary": "The script configures and runs a long‑duration, large‑scale population health simulation that activates every disease module and full health‑system interaction (HSI) components. It sets up the scenario, draws calibration parameters, configures logging, and launches the model either via a batch system or locally, producing outputs for demographic, disease burden, and health‑service usage analyses.", "business_intent": "To provide a comprehensive calibration tool that generates extensive simulation data for validating and tuning the health model's demographic trends, disease impacts, and health‑system utilization, supporting evidence‑based policy and planning decisions.", "keywords": ["population health simulation", "model calibration", "long‑run scenario", "disease modules", "health system interactions", "batch execution", "demographic patterns", "disease burden", "health service utilization", "scenario testing"], "summary_hash": "f610ffce8049", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:57:42+00:00"}
