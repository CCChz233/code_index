{"summary": "The module implements a dedicated logger process that continuously receives various telemetry packets (e.g., IMU, servo, apogee prediction, context) via a multiprocessing queue, buffers them, and writes the data to a CSV file in real time using a configurable buffer size to avoid blocking the main control loop.", "business_intent": "To provide a reliable, low‑latency mechanism for persisting flight‑critical telemetry data for post‑flight analysis, debugging, and performance evaluation without interfering with the real‑time operation of the air‑brake control system.", "keywords": ["telemetry", "CSV logging", "real-time", "multiprocessing", "buffered I/O", "flight data", "air‑brake", "IMU", "data packets", "process isolation"], "summary_hash": "cdfcc7e20372", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:28:03+00:00"}
