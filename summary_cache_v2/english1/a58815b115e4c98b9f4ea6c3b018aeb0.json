{"summary": "This module implements a comprehensive simulation of the labour and delivery continuum, covering the onset of labour, intrapartum complications, delivery (both facility and home), immediate postpartum outcomes, and the first two days after birth. It defines events for managing skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric interventions, postnatal checks, inpatient care, and mortality assessments, while also providing analysis tools to adjust coverage and quality parameters for policy scenario testing.", "business_intent": "To enable researchers and policymakers to evaluate the impact of health system interventions on maternal and newborn outcomes by modeling the full spectrum of labour-related events, complications, and postnatal care within a population health simulation.", "keywords": ["labour simulation", "delivery outcomes", "obstetric complications", "maternal mortality", "stillbirth", "postnatal care", "skilled birth attendance", "emergency obstetric care", "health policy analysis", "event-driven modeling"], "summary_hash": "edb0382b679e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:49:46+00:00"}
