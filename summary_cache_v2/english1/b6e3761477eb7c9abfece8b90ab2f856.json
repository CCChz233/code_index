{"summary": "This test suite validates the fake quantum backend implementations provided by the provider package. It checks that version‑2 simulated devices include appropriate noise models, correctly parse keyword arguments, expose the expected operation names, handle coupling maps, report default instruction durations and basis‑gate sets, and behave correctly when circuits are transpiled and executed.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the simulated quantum hardware used for development and testing accurately reflects the characteristics of real devices, enabling reliable algorithm validation and performance benchmarking.", "keywords": ["unit tests", "fake quantum backend", "noise model", "generic backend v2", "coupling map", "instruction durations", "basis gates", "transpilation", "circuit execution", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "e642a5cefd75", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:13:43+00:00"}
