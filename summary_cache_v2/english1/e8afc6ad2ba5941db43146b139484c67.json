{"summary": "A Flax Linen module that implements the decoder part of a variational auto‑encoder. It constructs a stack of up‑sampling blocks with configurable channel sizes, residual layers, group normalization and activation, optionally doubling the final channel dimension, and processes latent tensors into high‑dimensional outputs such as images.", "business_intent": "Enable generative modeling by reconstructing data from latent vectors within JAX/Flax pipelines, providing a reusable, JIT‑compatible decoder component for VAE architectures.", "keywords": ["VAE", "decoder", "Flax", "JAX", "upsampling", "residual block", "group normalization", "activation", "latent reconstruction", "generative model"], "summary_hash": "b8e16bd87b98", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:02:50+00:00"}
