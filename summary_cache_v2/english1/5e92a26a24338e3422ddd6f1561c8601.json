{"summary": "The script orchestrates the end‑to‑end fine‑tuning of a Flux diffusion model using DreamBooth with Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and optional 4‑bit quantization. It prepares a custom image dataset, applies necessary preprocessing, configures distributed training via Accelerate, loads and adapts the model, runs the training loop with scheduler and loss handling, and finally saves the adapted weights and a model card to a Hugging Face repository.", "business_intent": "Enable rapid, resource‑efficient personalization of large diffusion models for commercial image generation services, allowing companies to create custom visual styles or subjects with minimal compute and storage overhead.", "keywords": ["DreamBooth", "LoRA", "Flux", "quantization", "diffusion model", "fine‑tuning", "accelerate", "distributed training", "image dataset", "model card", "Hugging Face", "checkpoint", "low‑rank adaptation"], "summary_hash": "f13de3149916", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:06:14+00:00"}
