{"summary": "Implements a pipeline that reconstructs audio representations for a TTS dataset by reusing the internal components of a spectrogram generator, defaulting to a FastPitch model with learned alignment. It provides utilities for processing data in individual or multiple batches and is designed to be subclassed for alternative configurations.", "business_intent": "Enables fast generation of ground‑truth‑based spectrograms for evaluation, data augmentation, and debugging of speech synthesis systems, reducing the effort required to rebuild audio from existing dataset features.", "keywords": ["TTS", "spectrogram generation", "FastPitch", "learned alignment", "batch processing", "data augmentation", "audio reconstruction"], "summary_hash": "1d563a1a9736", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:50:18+00:00"}
