{"summary": "A collection of unit tests that verify the functionality of the TensorBoard logger within Lightning Fabric. The tests cover automatic and manual versioning, environment variable and home directory expansion in log paths, logger finalization, graph logging (including warning handling), logging of hyperparameters, metrics, and sub‑directory handling, as well as behavior when no logger name is provided and when log directories involve symlinks.", "business_intent": "To ensure that the TensorBoard logging integration works correctly and robustly for machine‑learning experiments, guaranteeing proper version management, path resolution, and accurate recording of model graphs, hyperparameters, and metrics.", "keywords": ["TensorBoard", "logger", "Lightning Fabric", "versioning", "environment variables", "path expansion", "graph logging", "hyperparameters", "metrics", "symlink", "unit tests", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "6e1df65cc7d4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:46:46+00:00"}
