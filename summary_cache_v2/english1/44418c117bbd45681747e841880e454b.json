{"summary": "The module implements a comprehensive framework for applying Megatron‑LM style model parallelism to PyTorch models within NeMo Lightning. It supplies utilities for caching iterators, managing user callbacks, aggregating masked token losses, and handling precision conversion. The central wrapper orchestrates tensor, pipeline, virtual pipeline, expert, and sequence parallelism, coordinates data and forward steps, performs loss reduction across distributed processes, and supports micro‑batch inference and sharded state handling.", "business_intent": "To provide developers with an out‑of‑the‑box solution for scaling large transformer models across multiple devices, enabling efficient distributed training and inference while abstracting the complexities of parallelism, loss aggregation, and precision management.", "keywords": ["distributed training", "model parallelism", "Megatron-LM", "tensor parallelism", "pipeline parallelism", "loss reduction", "callbacks", "precision plugin", "caching iterator", "micro‑batch inference", "NeMo", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "6b7f37d97941", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:00:15+00:00"}
