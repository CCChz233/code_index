{"summary": "The module supplies TensorFlow Keras layers and helper utilities for constructing graph neural network models in DGL. It includes global pooling layers that condense node embeddings into fixed‑size graph representations using various aggregation strategies, a heterogeneous graph convolution layer that processes each relation type separately and merges results, and lightweight backend utilities.", "business_intent": "To simplify the development and training of graph neural networks on the TensorFlow platform by providing ready‑to‑use pooling and convolution components that handle both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph structures.", "keywords": ["TensorFlow", "Keras", "graph neural networks", "global pooling", "heterogeneous graph convolution", "aggregation", "DGL", "neural network layers", "utilities"], "summary_hash": "a18363a6a3bd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:59:55+00:00"}
