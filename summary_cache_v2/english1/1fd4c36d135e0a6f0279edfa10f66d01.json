{"summary": "The module implements a framework for reading and writing array-like data structures in various file formats (CSV, NumPy binary, Parquet). It provides format‑specific parsers that convert between on‑disk representations and in‑memory structures such as NumPy arrays, pandas DataFrames, or Arrow tables, and a central registry that discovers and selects the appropriate parser at runtime for distributed partitioning tasks.", "business_intent": "To facilitate seamless data exchange and storage format interoperability within distributed partitioning pipelines, allowing large datasets to be efficiently serialized, deserialized, and memory‑mapped across different storage backends.", "keywords": ["array parsing", "CSV", "NumPy", "Parquet", "PyArrow", "pandas", "serialization", "deserialization", "registry", "distributed partitioning", "data format conversion"], "summary_hash": "c9e66003759f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:47:44+00:00"}
