{"summary": "The module defines custom neural‑network activation layers, including a smooth periodic activation and a smooth non‑linear activation equivalent to SiLU, along with a utility to apply the periodic activation. These components are built on PyTorch and intended for use in speech‑recognition models.", "business_intent": "Provide advanced activation functions that improve model expressiveness and performance in automatic speech recognition pipelines.", "keywords": ["activation function", "neural network", "periodic activation", "smooth non‑linearity", "PyTorch", "speech recognition", "ASR", "custom layer"], "summary_hash": "bf8a7e58491d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:12:35+00:00"}
