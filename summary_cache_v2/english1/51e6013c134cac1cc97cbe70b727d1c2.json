{"summary": "The qiskit.pulse.transforms package supplies a collection of utilities for modifying and standardizing quantum pulse schedules. It includes tools for aligning instructions across channels, converting schedules to backend‑specific representations, canonicalizing schedules by inlining sub‑routines, adding missing operations, flattening structures, compressing pulses, and removing redundancies, as well as translating schedules into directed acyclic graph (DAG) forms for analysis and optimization.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and quantum hardware providers to prepare, optimize, and translate pulse‑level programs into forms that are efficient, hardware‑compatible, and easier to analyze, thereby improving the reliability and performance of quantum experiments.", "keywords": ["quantum pulse", "schedule transformation", "alignment", "canonicalization", "DAG conversion", "backend Qobj", "optimization", "hardware compatibility", "instruction scheduling"], "summary_hash": "b26d5842fe38", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:05:52+00:00"}
