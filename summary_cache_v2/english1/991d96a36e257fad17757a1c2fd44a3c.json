{"summary": "A command‑line script that orchestrates the fine‑tuning of the Stable Diffusion InstructPix2Pix model with LoRA adapters. It parses configuration options, loads and preprocesses image‑instruction datasets, sets up the diffusion pipeline, runs a distributed training loop using Accelerate, logs progress (optionally to Weights & Biases), saves checkpoints, and pushes the resulting model to the Hugging Face Hub.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use tool for developers and researchers to customize the InstructPix2Pix image‑editing diffusion model on proprietary data, enabling tailored image‑to‑image generation capabilities for commercial products or research projects.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "instructpix2pix", "lora", "fine-tuning", "diffusion model", "image-to-image editing", "accelerate", "huggingface", "dataset preprocessing", "wandb", "model checkpoint", "model hub"], "summary_hash": "e2a7debe1b9d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:06:00+00:00"}
