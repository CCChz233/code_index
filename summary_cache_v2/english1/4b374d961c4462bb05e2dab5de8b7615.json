{"summary": "A unit‑test suite that validates the Timesformer video transformer model. It checks the model’s configuration, forward pass, hidden‑state and attention outputs, video‑classification behavior, and loading from pretrained weights, while adapting the generic tests to Timesformer’s specific input format (no token IDs, embeddings, attention mask or sequence length).", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the Timesformer implementation works correctly for video classification pipelines, enabling reliable integration, maintenance, and deployment of the model in production systems.", "keywords": ["Timesformer", "unit test", "video classification", "model verification", "hidden states", "attention outputs", "pretrained model", "configuration", "testing", "transformer"], "summary_hash": "81aedc6746ef", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:45:35+00:00"}
