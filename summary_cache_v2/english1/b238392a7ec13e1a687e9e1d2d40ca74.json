{"summary": "The script demonstrates how to accelerate and shrink a SentenceTransformer model through knowledge distillation. It trains a lightweight student model to mimic the embeddings of a high‑performing teacher model using a large, diverse corpus (SNLI, Multi‑NLI, Wikipedia). Two student initialization strategies are showcased: training a compact transformer from scratch or pruning the teacher to retain only a subset of its layers. The workflow includes dataset loading, sentence preprocessing, embedding generation, loss definition, training orchestration, and similarity evaluation, ultimately yielding a model that retains most of the teacher's accuracy while offering significant speed gains.", "business_intent": "Provide a practical example for developers and data scientists to create fast, resource‑efficient sentence embedding models suitable for real‑time semantic search, recommendation, or NLP services where low latency and reduced computational cost are critical.", "keywords": ["knowledge distillation", "sentence embeddings", "model compression", "teacher‑student training", "layer pruning", "TinyBERT", "semantic similarity", "performance‑speed trade‑off", "dataset preparation", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "663bf0b85bc0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:58:13+00:00"}
