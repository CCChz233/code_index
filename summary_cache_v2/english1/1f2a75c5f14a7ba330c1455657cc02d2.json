{"summary": "The module creates visual analyses that compare simulated demographic outcomes—such as births, total population, and mortality—to observed data, using results from predefined long‑run simulation scenarios. It extracts relevant metrics, computes annual averages, and produces plots including population pyramids to assess model fidelity.", "business_intent": "To validate and calibrate the demographic components of a health simulation model, ensuring that its predictions of population dynamics align with real‑world statistics for reliable policy and planning insights.", "keywords": ["demographic calibration", "births", "population size", "mortality", "population pyramid", "simulation scenario", "data comparison", "visualization", "model validation", "health modeling"], "summary_hash": "f2f24164e397", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:57:32+00:00"}
