{"summary": "This module serves as a tutorial example that demonstrates how to work with NumPy arrays and Cython type inference. It defines a global data type, provides a small utility for clipping array values, and includes a sample computation routine that showcases inferred types, though the routine is not referenced elsewhere in the project.", "business_intent": "To educate developers on integrating NumPy with Cython, illustrating type declarations and basic array manipulations for performance‑oriented numerical code.", "keywords": ["NumPy", "Cython", "type inference", "array operations", "clipping", "tutorial example", "numerical computing"], "summary_hash": "be9d035f8fd8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:17:14+00:00"}
