{"summary": "The script orchestrates the end‑to‑end workflow for training and evaluating a subgraph‑based link prediction model on Open Graph Benchmark datasets using DGL and PyTorch. It defines a dataset wrapper that loads, caches, and preprocesses the OGB‑L graph collection, sets up data loading, constructs the NGNN‑SEAL model, runs the training loop, and computes standard link prediction metrics such as hits@K, mean reciprocal rank and ROC‑AUC.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run reference implementation that enables researchers and engineers to benchmark SEAL‑style graph neural network models for link prediction tasks on OGB datasets, facilitating reproducible experiments and performance comparison.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "DGL", "OGB", "link prediction", "SEAL", "NGNN", "graph neural network", "dataset preprocessing", "evaluation metrics", "training loop"], "summary_hash": "b81db98a6a37", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:28:42+00:00"}
