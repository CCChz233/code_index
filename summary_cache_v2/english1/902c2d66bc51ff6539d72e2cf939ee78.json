{"summary": "This module implements a quantum gate class that models the unitary time evolution generated by a Hermitian Hamiltonian. It validates the Hamiltonian, supports a parameterized evolution time, can produce the corresponding unitary matrix, and provides decomposition into native basis gates for small systems or direct simulation for larger registers, integrating seamlessly with Qiskit circuits.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to embed physically motivated Hamiltonian dynamics into quantum algorithms, simplifying the creation, simulation, and compilation of such operations within the Qiskit framework for quantum computing applications.", "keywords": ["Hamiltonian", "quantum gate", "unitary evolution", "time evolution", "Hermitian", "parameterized gate", "Qiskit", "circuit decomposition", "quantum simulation", "physics-inspired algorithms"], "summary_hash": "31ef2292aefe", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:09:17+00:00"}
