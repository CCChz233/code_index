{"summary": "Implements a PyTorch Lightning strategy that orchestrates training on XLA devices (TPUs). It handles process launching, device placement, inter‑process synchronization, data‑parallel (DDP) setup, precision configuration, data loading, and checkpoint I/O, integrating with the Lightning ecosystem.", "business_intent": "Enable users to train deep learning models efficiently on TPU clusters without dealing with low‑level XLA details, thereby accelerating development and scaling of AI workloads.", "keywords": ["XLA", "TPU", "PyTorch Lightning", "strategy", "multi‑process launch", "device allocation", "synchronization", "data parallel", "DDP", "precision handling", "checkpointing", "environment", "plugins"], "summary_hash": "ace33a401af6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:52:38+00:00"}
