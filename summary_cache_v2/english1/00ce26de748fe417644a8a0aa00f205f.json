{"summary": "This module implements a collection of utility functions that convert quantum channel objects between the various standard representations (Chi matrix, Choi matrix, Kraus operators, superoperator, PTM, Stinespring dilation, and operator form). It also provides low‑level helpers for tensor reshaping, reshuffling, bipartite tensor construction, and dimension validation required for these transformations.", "business_intent": "Facilitate seamless interoperability of quantum channel data within Qiskit by allowing developers and researchers to switch between different mathematical descriptions of quantum noise and processes, supporting analysis, simulation, and algorithm development.", "keywords": ["quantum channel", "representation conversion", "Chi matrix", "Choi matrix", "Kraus operators", "superoperator", "process tensor matrix", "PTM", "Stinespring dilation", "operator form", "reshuffle", "tensor manipulation", "validation", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "e1c6408bf89b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:07:36+00:00"}
