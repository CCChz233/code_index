{"summary": "This module supplies utilities for constructing k2 finite‑state automaton topologies used in automatic speech recognition. It offers functions to generate various graph structures (compact, default, minimal, shared‑blank) and a builder that creates RNNT emission adapters by inserting zero‑weight epsilon arcs and rerouting the blank token, facilitating composition with supervision FSAs.", "business_intent": "Provide ready‑made graph topologies and emission adapters to streamline the development, training, and inference of ASR models that rely on k2‑based finite‑state representations, improving efficiency and correctness of model supervision.", "keywords": ["k2", "finite-state automaton", "topology", "ASR", "RNNT", "CTC", "emission adapter", "epsilon arcs", "blank token", "graph construction", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "af7cd1edd35b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:13:20+00:00"}
