{"summary": "A collection of Cython example modules demonstrating how to define and employ fused types for writing generic, high‑performance functions that operate on multiple data types such as characters, floating‑point numbers, pointers, and numeric scalars. The examples cover value manipulation, conditional GIL release, array indexing, pointer usage, and runtime type validation.", "business_intent": "Educate developers on using Cython fused types to create flexible, type‑agnostic code that retains C‑level speed, thereby improving productivity and performance in scientific and systems programming.", "keywords": ["Cython", "fused types", "generic programming", "type specialization", "performance", "pointer handling", "array indexing", "GIL management", "runtime type checking", "numeric types", "character data"], "summary_hash": "53c1bd439ae2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:31:18+00:00"}
