{"summary": "The module provides a swap‑strategy abstraction that builds and manages sequences of parallel SWAP layers. It updates the device coupling map, tracks the induced qubit permutations, and supplies methods to construct, apply, and evaluate these layers, supporting the routing of commuting two‑qubit gates during quantum circuit transpilation.", "business_intent": "Enable more efficient quantum circuit compilation by optimizing the placement of commuting two‑qubit operations on hardware, thereby reducing circuit depth and error accumulation during the transpilation process.", "keywords": ["swap strategy", "parallel SWAP layers", "coupling map", "qubit permutation", "routing", "commuting two-qubit gates", "transpiler", "quantum compilation", "circuit optimization", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "2d6c3b619ee7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:31:10+00:00"}
