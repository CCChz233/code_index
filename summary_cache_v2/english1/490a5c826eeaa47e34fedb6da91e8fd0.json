{"summary": "This module implements the core mocking infrastructure for AWS services used by Moto. It defines a base mock class and two concrete modes—proxy and server—that intercept boto3 client and resource creation, supply simulated service implementations, manage configuration such as region and account ID, and enable response overriding and request stubbing.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to test code that depends on AWS services locally and in CI without making real network calls, reducing cost, improving test speed, and providing deterministic behavior.", "keywords": ["mock", "AWS", "boto3", "testing", "proxy mode", "server mode", "patching", "client", "resource", "region", "account", "stubber", "responses", "configuration"], "summary_hash": "2dead315b5fb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:55:50+00:00"}
