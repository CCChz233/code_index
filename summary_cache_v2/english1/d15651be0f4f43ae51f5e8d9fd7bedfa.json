{"summary": "Defines a parameterized quantum circuit that encodes classical data into quantum states using a second‑order Pauli‑Z (ZZ) expansion. The circuit is built as a subclass of a generic Pauli‑based feature map and provides the necessary gates for data‑driven quantum algorithms.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum machine‑learning workflows by supplying a ready‑to‑use data‑encoding circuit that can be plugged into kernel methods, variational classifiers, or other algorithms requiring a feature map.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "feature map", "Pauli-Z", "ZZ interaction", "data encoding", "quantum machine learning", "Qiskit", "parameterized circuit", "second-order expansion"], "summary_hash": "4b5d61f52814", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:16:06+00:00"}
