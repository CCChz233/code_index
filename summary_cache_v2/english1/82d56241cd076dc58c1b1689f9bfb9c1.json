{"summary": "A test suite that verifies the functionality and performance of the Stable Diffusion XL image‑to‑image pipeline when using only the refiner component. It employs dummy components and inputs to run fast unit tests covering attention slicing, component integrity, inference consistency, model saving/loading, various conditioning cases (negative prompts, prompt embeddings), and offloading behavior.", "business_intent": "Provide automated regression testing to ensure the refiner‑only image‑to‑image pipeline operates correctly across different configurations, enabling reliable integration into products and accelerating development cycles.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "image-to-image", "refiner", "pipeline", "unit testing", "dummy components", "attention slicing", "inference consistency", "negative prompts", "prompt embeddings", "offloading", "serialization"], "summary_hash": "63cc14140e3d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:14:02+00:00"}
