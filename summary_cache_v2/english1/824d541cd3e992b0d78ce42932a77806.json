{"summary": "The module defines a builder class that constructs configuration objects for encoder‑decoder CTC speech‑recognition models (QuartzNet) with fluent methods to set hyperparameters such as normalization, dropout, label set, repeat factor, sample rate, and separable convolutions. It also supplies convenience helpers that return ready‑made configurations for common QuartzNet/Jasper architectures.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to quickly assemble and customize QuartzNet ASR model configurations within the NVIDIA NeMo framework, streamlining experimentation, scaling, and deployment of speech‑recognition solutions.", "keywords": ["QuartzNet", "ASR", "configuration builder", "CTC model", "speech recognition", "NeMo", "hyperparameter tuning", "encoder‑decoder", "preset model variants", "audio preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "a19ecaf1de12", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:18:42+00:00"}
