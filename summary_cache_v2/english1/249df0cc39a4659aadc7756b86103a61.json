{"summary": "This module implements a training pipeline for Graph Attention Networks (GAT) using the DGL library with MXNet backend. It loads citation graph datasets, constructs a GAT model with multi‑head attention, applies sparse matrix‑vector multiplication optimizations, and runs a training loop with evaluation and early‑stopping support.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example for developers and researchers to benchmark and study GAT models on standard citation networks, illustrating efficient MXNet‑based training and evaluation within DGL.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "graph attention network", "DGL", "MXNet", "citation dataset", "training loop", "evaluation", "early stopping", "SPMV optimization", "multi‑head batching"], "summary_hash": "470a1e81ce54", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:09:32+00:00"}
