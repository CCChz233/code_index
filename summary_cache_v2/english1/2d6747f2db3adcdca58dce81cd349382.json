{"summary": "Applies elastic deformation to images, masks, bounding boxes, and keypoints for data augmentation. Generates random displacement fields, smooths them with a Gaussian filter, and warps all targets consistently using configurable scaling, smoothing, and interpolation parameters. Handles out‑of‑bounds objects by discarding them.", "business_intent": "Improve the robustness and generalization of deep learning models for segmentation, detection, and keypoint tasks by augmenting training data with realistic elastic distortions.", "keywords": ["elastic deformation", "data augmentation", "image segmentation", "object detection", "keypoint augmentation", "displacement fields", "Gaussian smoothing", "consistent transformation", "mask interpolation", "bounding box handling"], "summary_hash": "885d98d601b7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:25:15+00:00"}
