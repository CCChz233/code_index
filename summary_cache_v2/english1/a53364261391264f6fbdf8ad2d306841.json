{"summary": "The module defines a collection of lightweight, plotter‑agnostic drawing objects (rectangular boxes, lines, text labels, and multi‑bit gate links) that encapsulate geometric coordinates, visual styling, and a unique data key. These objects serve as the basic visual primitives for the timeline canvas, allowing the canvas to manage visibility and incremental updates efficiently while keeping the visualization logic independent of any specific graphics backend.", "business_intent": "Enable modular, testable, and backend‑independent rendering of scheduled quantum circuit timelines in Qiskit, supporting efficient updates and easy integration with multiple plotters such as matplotlib.", "keywords": ["drawing objects", "timeline visualization", "quantum circuit", "plotter agnostic", "box geometry", "line geometry", "text annotation", "gate link", "data key", "canvas management", "unit testing", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "0af389f4cacf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:03:08+00:00"}
