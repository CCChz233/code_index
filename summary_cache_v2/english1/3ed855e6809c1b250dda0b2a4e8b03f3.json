{"summary": "The module implements a thin wrapper around the AI21 language model service, translating OpenAI‑style request formats into AI21 API calls for chat completions, standard completions, and embeddings. It defines configuration structures, custom error handling, and utility functions that allow developers to interact with AI21 models using a familiar OpenAI‑compatible interface.", "business_intent": "Provide a seamless, OpenAI‑compatible integration layer for AI21 models so that applications can leverage AI21's generation and embedding capabilities without dealing with low‑level API specifics, thereby accelerating development and expanding model options.", "keywords": ["AI21", "language model", "chat completions", "text completions", "embeddings", "OpenAI compatibility", "API integration", "configuration", "error handling", "LLM"], "summary_hash": "72327afce07e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:07:59+00:00"}
