{"summary": "The module implements a linear multistep scheduler tailored for discrete diffusion models. It creates beta schedules, converts them to sigma representations, manages timesteps, scales inputs, and performs LMS-based state updates to generate samples during the diffusion sampling process.", "business_intent": "Provide a robust and efficient scheduling component that drives the sampling loop of diffusion-based generative models, enabling faster and higher-quality image generation by accurately predicting denoised samples across timesteps.", "keywords": ["diffusion models", "scheduler", "linear multistep", "LMS", "beta schedule", "sigma conversion", "timestep management", "sampling", "denoising", "PyTorch", "Karras diffusion"], "summary_hash": "9d92e07cc144", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:13:55+00:00"}
