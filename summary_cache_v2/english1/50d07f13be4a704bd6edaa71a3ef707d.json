{"summary": "The module implements a collection of neural embedding layers and utilities that transform timesteps, spatial/temporal patches, text, image features, and other conditioning signals into dense vector representations. It includes positional encodings (sinusoidal, rotary, Fourier), patch embedding for 2‑D and 3‑D data, attention‑based pooling, and combined embeddings that fuse multiple modalities for diffusion‑based generative models.", "business_intent": "Provide reusable, model‑agnostic embedding components that enable diffusion and transformer architectures to incorporate rich conditioning information (time, position, visual patches, textual prompts, style cues, etc.), thereby facilitating the development and deployment of advanced generative AI pipelines.", "keywords": ["embedding", "positional encoding", "timestep", "patch embedding", "attention pooling", "rotary", "Fourier features", "diffusion model", "transformer", "conditioning", "image", "text", "video", "IP‑Adapter"], "summary_hash": "36dd9943a375", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:15:30+00:00"}
