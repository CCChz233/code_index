{"summary": "The process package implements a flexible data‑processing framework for IAB job records. It provides a core abstract pipeline that validates incoming intent data, extracts personally identifiable information, hashes it for privacy, and supplies the results to downstream formatters. Building on this foundation, specialized processors either enrich intent records by repeatedly fetching and validating leads until quota targets are met, handling over‑fetching and hit‑rate considerations, or execute a simple linear pipeline without quota management. The overall design enables configurable validation, privacy‑preserving hashing, and lead generation for advertising workflows.", "business_intent": "To convert raw advertising intent data into compliant, anonymized leads that can be delivered to marketing partners, ensuring data quality, privacy, and fulfillment of lead quotas.", "keywords": ["data processing pipeline", "validation", "PII extraction", "MD5 hashing", "lead enrichment", "over‑fetching", "hit‑rate handling", "quota management", "IAB job", "intent events", "privacy compliance"], "summary_hash": "2ae400003d7e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:50:53+00:00"}
