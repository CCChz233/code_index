{"summary": "A collection of pytest test cases and helper functions that exercise the custom assertion utilities in the simulation testing toolkit. The tests cover validation of file types (JSON/YAML), mock simulation file creation, checks on shower counts and energy ranges, and verification of sim_telarray output handling, primarily serving as unit tests for these assertion helpers.", "business_intent": "Provide automated verification that the assertion helpers used in simulation workflows correctly enforce file format expectations, data constraints, and output integrity, thereby supporting reliable scientific data processing.", "keywords": ["unit tests", "pytest", "assertion utilities", "mock files", "JSON", "YAML", "sim_telarray", "shower count", "energy range", "file type validation"], "summary_hash": "0fe9f1dcebcc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:54:25+00:00"}
