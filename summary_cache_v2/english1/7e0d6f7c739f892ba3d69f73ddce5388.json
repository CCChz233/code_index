{"summary": "The module implements a distributed sparse embedding layer that stores node or edge embeddings across multiple machines. It leverages DGL’s distributed tensor infrastructure to provide sparse, mini‑batch‑driven forward passes and integrates with DGL’s distributed optimizers for efficient parameter updates.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable training of graph neural networks on massive graphs by offering a memory‑efficient, distributed embedding solution that reduces communication overhead and supports high‑throughput mini‑batch training.", "keywords": ["distributed", "sparse embedding", "graph neural network", "mini-batch", "optimizer", "partitioned", "DGL", "PyTorch", "large-scale", "node embeddings", "edge embeddings"], "summary_hash": "a512dee80098", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:46:51+00:00"}
