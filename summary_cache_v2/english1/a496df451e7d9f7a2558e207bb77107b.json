{"summary": "The module implements a set of client classes that interact with external retrieval services based on Faiss and a combined retrieval backend. It defines an abstract interface for adding documents, resetting the index, performing K‑nearest‑neighbor queries, updating weight parameters, and persisting the index state, and provides concrete implementations for static Faiss, dynamic Faiss, and a combo service used in Megatron‑based NLP pipelines.", "business_intent": "To provide scalable and updatable vector similarity search capabilities for retrieval‑augmented language models, enabling fast nearest‑neighbor lookup, index management, and weight tuning during training or inference.", "keywords": ["retrieval", "Faiss", "KNN", "vector embeddings", "index management", "dynamic update", "combo service", "NLP", "Megatron", "similarity search", "client API"], "summary_hash": "cd4016b391f6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:26:15+00:00"}
