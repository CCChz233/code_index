{"summary": "A preprocessing layer that linearly rescales input tensors by multiplying with a configurable factor and adding an offset, thereby mapping values from their original range (e.g., 0‑255) to a target range such as 0‑1 or -1‑1. It handles integer and floating‑point inputs, outputs floating‑point tensors, and operates transparently during both training and inference, including within tf.data pipelines.", "business_intent": "Provide a simple, reusable component for normalizing input data—especially images—so that models receive consistently scaled values, eliminating the need for external preprocessing code and ensuring identical transformations across training and deployment.", "keywords": ["preprocessing", "rescaling", "normalization", "scale", "offset", "image data", "TensorFlow layer", "data pipeline", "dtype conversion", "range transformation"], "summary_hash": "e428a7df19cf", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:06:03+00:00"}
