{"summary": "The class encapsulates the definition and construction of a ROMS model domain, handling the creation of the horizontal layout, land‑sea mask, bathymetric field, and vertical stretching system based on user‑specified dimensions, location, rotation and topography source. It validates inputs, supports visualisation, and provides persistence to files or YAML configurations, while allowing later updates to bathymetry or vertical parameters.", "business_intent": "Enable scientists and engineers to quickly generate, inspect, modify, and export complete ROMS grid specifications for ocean simulations, reducing manual preprocessing effort and ensuring consistent, reproducible domain setups.", "keywords": ["ROMS", "grid generation", "ocean modeling", "horizontal grid", "mask creation", "bathymetry", "vertical coordinate", "topography source", "plotting", "saving", "YAML", "domain size validation", "grid rotation"], "summary_hash": "f03e21e62532", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:14:11+00:00"}
