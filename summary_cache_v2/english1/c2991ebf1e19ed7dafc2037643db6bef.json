{"summary": "Defines an abstract handler that encapsulates the core workflow for processing Terraform foreach (and count) constructs during graph construction. It renders variable expressions, creates duplicated resource blocks for each iteration, updates their attributes, and integrates the resulting sub‑graph into the overall Terraform dependency graph.", "business_intent": "Allow the static analysis engine to expand foreach loops into individual resource representations so that security, compliance, and dependency checks can be performed on each concrete instance generated by Terraform code.", "keywords": ["Terraform", "foreach", "count", "graph building", "resource expansion", "variable rendering", "dependency graph", "static analysis", "Checkov", "block duplication", "attribute update"], "summary_hash": "e8bc64829b25", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:46:48+00:00"}
