{"summary": "The module implements a benchmark for solving a hexagonal puzzle (level 36) by modeling the game board as a collection of hex cells, tracking explored positions, and providing utilities to read level data, generate moves, and advance the solution state. It includes abstractions for filesystem directories, positional coordinates, and generic nodes, and contains helper routines to drive the solving process and measure execution time.", "business_intent": "To assess and compare the performance of puzzle‑solving algorithms (especially Cython‑accelerated code) on a standardized hex‑grid challenge, serving as a reference workload for optimization and benchmarking purposes.", "keywords": ["benchmark", "hexagonal grid", "puzzle solver", "search algorithm", "state tracking", "move generation", "performance measurement", "Cython", "level file parsing", "algorithmic optimization"], "summary_hash": "9ad4bcf0ce82", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:20:28+00:00"}
