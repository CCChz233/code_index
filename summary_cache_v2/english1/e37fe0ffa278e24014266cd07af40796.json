{"summary": "Provides a complete training pipeline that fine‑tunes the UNet component of a Stable Diffusion text‑to‑image model on TPU hardware using PyTorch/XLA. The code handles dataset loading and caption tokenization, builds the VAE, UNet, tokenizer and scheduler, configures an AdamW optimizer with mixed‑precision bf16, and runs a distributed training loop with GSPMD sharding and checkpoint/model‑card management.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to efficiently adapt Stable Diffusion models to custom image‑caption datasets at scale on TPUs, reducing training time and cost while delivering ready‑to‑use fine‑tuned models for downstream image generation tasks.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion", "text-to-image", "diffusion model", "fine-tuning", "TPU", "PyTorch XLA", "distributed training", "GSPMD", "data parallel", "UNet", "VAE", "tokenizer", "scheduler", "AdamW", "mixed precision", "bf16", "checkpointing", "model card"], "summary_hash": "1f0133a243f1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:38:27+00:00"}
