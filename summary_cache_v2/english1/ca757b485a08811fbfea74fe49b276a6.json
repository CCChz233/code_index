{"summary": "The module offers a suite of utilities for analyzing and synthesizing two‑qubit quantum gates. It can compute local invariants to test equivalence under single‑qubit operations, transform gates into Weyl chamber coordinates via the magic basis, and apply KAK‑based algorithms to decompose any two‑qubit unitary into a minimal sequence of entangling gates (e.g., CX) surrounded by single‑qubit rotations, with support for exact, approximate, and specialized decompositions.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient quantum circuit compilation by providing robust methods to characterize, compare, and decompose two‑qubit operations into hardware‑friendly gate sets, facilitating optimized quantum algorithm implementation.", "keywords": ["two-qubit", "unitary decomposition", "local invariants", "KAK algorithm", "entangling gates", "CX", "Weyl chamber", "magic basis", "circuit synthesis", "quantum compilation"], "summary_hash": "5ea3bfd3f342", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:04:26+00:00"}
