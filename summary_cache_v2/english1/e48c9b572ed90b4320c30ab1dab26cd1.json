{"summary": "The caching package implements a flexible, multi‑backend caching system for language model API requests. It defines a generic cache interface and concrete implementations for in‑memory, disk, Redis, S3, and vector‑store (Qdrant) backends, including semantic caches that store embeddings. A high‑level handler orchestrates cache selection, key generation, and response assembly, supporting synchronous, asynchronous, and batch operations while handling expiration, eviction, and logging.", "business_intent": "Accelerate LLM service responses, lower API usage costs, and improve reliability by reusing prior results through a configurable, high‑performance caching layer that can operate locally or across distributed stores.", "keywords": ["caching", "LLM", "language model", "in‑memory", "disk", "Redis", "S3", "Qdrant", "semantic cache", "asynchronous", "batch processing", "cache key generation", "expiration", "eviction"], "summary_hash": "bcb48f0e7ea6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:05:27+00:00"}
