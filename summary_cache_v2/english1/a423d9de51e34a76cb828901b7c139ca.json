{"summary": "Provides a Pyodide‑specific implementation of the Flet client connection, establishing and maintaining a two‑way channel between the Python code executing in the browser (via Pyodide) and the JavaScript front‑end. It receives messages from JavaScript, decodes protocol commands, dispatches them to the Flet core, and sends encoded responses or actions back to the web client, handling connection lifecycle and asynchronous processing.", "business_intent": "Allow Flet applications to run entirely in the browser by bridging Python logic with the JavaScript UI layer, enabling developers to write UI code in Python that communicates with the web client through a standardized protocol.", "keywords": ["pyodide", "flet", "connection", "javascript", "async", "protocol", "message handling", "web client", "bi-directional communication", "page commands"], "summary_hash": "8e97f33c3edf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:58:56+00:00"}
