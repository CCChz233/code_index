{"summary": "The module provides utilities for analyzing and restructuring directed acyclic graphs that represent quantum circuits. It offers mechanisms to partition a circuit DAG into maximal blocks that meet configurable criteria, to further divide those blocks into independent sub‑blocks based on qubit usage, and to merge consecutive blocks back together. The implementations support both standard circuit DAGs and dependency‑aware DAGs, employing greedy heuristics and union‑find data structures for efficient processing.", "business_intent": "Facilitate circuit optimization and transformation workflows by enabling fine‑grained block-level manipulation of quantum circuit DAGs, improving compilation speed, resource scheduling, and the ability to apply localized optimizations or error‑mitigation techniques.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "DAG", "block partitioning", "block merging", "block splitting", "dependency analysis", "greedy algorithm", "union‑find", "circuit optimization", "graph restructuring"], "summary_hash": "40d5bf2b52e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:51:54+00:00"}
