Avoid using method names like \"pull\" \"push\"? The instruction says \"Do NOT list method names verbatim.\" So we cannot include method names exactly as they appear. So we must avoid words like \"push\", \"pull\", \"register_pull_handler\". But we can describe functionality without using exact method names. Use synonyms: \"send data\", \"retrieve data\", \"register callbacks\". Avoid \"push\" and \"pull\". Use \"transfer\", \"fetch\". Avoid \"register_pull_handler\". Use \"set up pull handler\". But \"pull\" is a method name; we should avoid using the word \"pull\" as a method name. However the word \"pull\" may appear in description but not as method name? The instruction says \"Do NOT list method names verbatim.\" So we can still use the word \"pull\" in description if not referencing method name? Safer to avoid. Use \"retrieve\" instead of \"pull\". Use \"send\" instead of \"push\". Use \"set up handlers\". Use \"union\" maybe avoid. Use \"combine\". Use \"barrier\" maybe okay as concept but also method name. Might be okay but to be safe we can describe as \"synchronization barrier\". That's okay.\n\nLet's craft summary: \"KVClient acts as the client side of", "business_intent": "We need to produce JSON with keys: summary, business_intent, keywords (list).
