{"summary": "A list‑like container that stores Particle and CustomParticle objects, automatically converting inputs to the appropriate particle type and exposing their physical attributes (mass, charge, symbols, etc.) as unit‑aware arrays. It supports standard list operations, arithmetic combination of particles, and calculation of nuclear reaction energy between collections.", "business_intent": "Enable users to manage groups of particles efficiently, retrieve collective properties for analysis, and perform common plasma‑physics calculations such as averaging and reaction‑energy evaluation without handling individual particle instances.", "keywords": ["particle collection", "list container", "mass", "charge", "symbol", "unit-aware", "average", "nuclear reaction energy", "plasmapy", "custom particle", "vectorized properties"], "summary_hash": "596f0b992fda", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:48:42+00:00"}
