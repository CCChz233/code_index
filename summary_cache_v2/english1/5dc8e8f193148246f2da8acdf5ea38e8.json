{"summary": "The module supplies utilities for animation diffusion pipelines, introducing a mixin that adds FreeNoise support and controls for its activation, block‑wise application, and split‑inference handling of attention, motion, ResNet and sampler stages, as well as a wrapper that splits large tensors into chunks, processes each chunk through a sub‑module, and recombines the results to reduce memory consumption during inference.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with a flexible, memory‑efficient way to incorporate the FreeNoise technique into animated diffusion workflows, improving generation quality and scalability while allowing optional activation and efficient resource usage.", "keywords": ["FreeNoise", "animation diffusion", "pipeline mixin", "split inference", "memory efficient", "tensor chunking", "attention", "motion", "ResNet", "sampler", "prompt encoding", "latent preparation", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "0366609aafec", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:11:52+00:00"}
