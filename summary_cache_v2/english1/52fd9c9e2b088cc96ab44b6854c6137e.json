{"summary": "Implements a Home Assistant switch platform that drives 433 MHz RF devices through a Raspberry Pi GPIO pin. It validates configuration parameters such as on/off codes, protocol, pulse length and repetitions, and defines a switch entity that transmits the appropriate RF signal to toggle the external device while exposing its state to Home Assistant.", "business_intent": "Allow Home Assistant users to control RF‑based appliances (e.g., sockets, lights) using a Raspberry Pi as a low‑cost transmitter, integrating these devices into home automation workflows.", "keywords": ["Home Assistant", "switch platform", "Raspberry Pi", "GPIO", "433 MHz", "RF transmission", "rpi‑rf", "on/off codes", "protocol", "pulse length", "signal repetitions", "home automation"], "summary_hash": "38ffc3769db9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:39:07+00:00"}
