{"summary": "The module implements a diffusion‑based control policy for robotic manipulation. It defines a policy that samples position trajectories for a robot arm using a 1‑D UNet diffusion model, conditioned on encoded visual and state observations of the robot and target block. Supporting encoder and projection components transform raw observation vectors into latent representations used by the diffusion process.", "business_intent": "Offer a reference implementation for researchers and developers to apply diffusion models to reinforcement‑learning tasks, enabling generation of feasible robot motion plans for tasks such as block placement and orientation alignment, thereby accelerating development of advanced robot control solutions.", "keywords": ["diffusion policy", "robot arm", "trajectory generation", "observation encoding", "conditional diffusion", "reinforcement learning", "UNet1D", "DDPMScheduler", "motion planning", "block manipulation"], "summary_hash": "c2a12f74ce23", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:58:00+00:00"}
