{"summary": "This module serves as a template example for training a TAGCN graph neural network on citation network datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) using the MXNet backend with DGL. It imports the necessary libraries and defines a simple evaluation helper, but the main execution routine is currently a placeholder without actual training logic.", "business_intent": "Offer developers a starter script that demonstrates how to set up data loading, model instantiation, and evaluation scaffolding for TAGCN models in MXNet, facilitating rapid prototyping and learning for graph‑based machine learning projects.", "keywords": ["MXNet", "DGL", "TAGCN", "graph neural network", "citation dataset", "example script", "training template", "evaluation helper", "placeholder code"], "summary_hash": "8d12b7eed387", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:09:23+00:00"}
