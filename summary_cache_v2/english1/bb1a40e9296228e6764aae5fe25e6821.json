{"summary": "The module contains pytest fixtures, mock utilities, and test cases that validate the software composition analysis (SCA) scanning workflow for container images. It simulates Bridgecrew platform interactions, provides synthetic scan data, and checks that the scanner correctly processes results, respects licensing and enforcement policies, handles cached or error responses, and produces accurate output reports in multiple formats (console, CSV, CycloneDX, JUnit XML, SARIF) for both Docker and Kubernetes scenarios.", "business_intent": "Guarantee reliable and policy‑compliant SCA scanning of container images by automatically testing the scanner’s core logic, result handling, and report generation, thereby supporting secure software supply chain practices.", "keywords": ["SCA", "container image", "security scanning", "pytest", "fixtures", "mocks", "report generation", "CSV", "CycloneDX", "JUnit XML", "SARIF", "licensing policies", "enforcement rules", "Docker", "Kubernetes", "test runner"], "summary_hash": "c9c4b7817363", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:22:37+00:00"}
