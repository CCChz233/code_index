{"summary": "The Encoder module implements the encoding pathway of a variational autoencoder. It receives multi‑channel input, passes it through a configurable stack of down‑sampling blocks whose output channel sizes, depth per block, normalization groups, and activation function can be customized. An optional setting expands the final block’s channel dimension to emit separate mean and log‑variance tensors for the latent distribution, effectively mapping the input to a compact latent representation.", "business_intent": "Provide a versatile, plug‑and‑play component that reduces high‑dimensional data (such as images) into a low‑dimensional latent space, enabling variational inference and downstream generative decoding in AI models.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "encoder", "down‑sampling blocks", "latent representation", "configurable architecture", "normalization groups", "activation function", "double latent dimension", "feature extraction", "neural network layer"], "summary_hash": "c5c44868d3c8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:35:27+00:00"}
