{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class TFLongformerForMaskedLM. It's a TensorFlow implementation of Longformer model for masked language modeling. The methods: __init__, build, call, get_lm_head, get_prefix_bias_name. So class responsibility: define a Longformer model for masked language modeling, handling building layers, forward pass, providing access to language modeling head and prefix bias name. Business intent: enable masked language modeling tasks such as text completion, token prediction, pretraining, fine-tuning for NLP applications.
