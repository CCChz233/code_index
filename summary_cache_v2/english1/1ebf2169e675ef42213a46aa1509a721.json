{"summary": "The module defines a Python wrapper class that interfaces with the MODFLOW 6 dynamic library (libMF6.dll) via the XMI API. It enables runtime access to internal model arrays—such as constant‑head boundaries and flow terms—allowing users to query and modify these data while a simulation is executing. The wrapper also provides configurable options for printing or saving boundary and flow information and can be attached to both flow and transport simulations.", "business_intent": "To facilitate real‑time interaction with MODFLOW 6 groundwater models, supporting dynamic data extraction, monitoring, and modification during simulations for advanced analysis, model coupling, and decision‑making workflows.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW 6", "DLL", "XMI API", "Python wrapper", "runtime model access", "boundary conditions", "flow rates", "simulation monitoring", "data extraction", "model modification", "groundwater modeling", "flow simulation", "transport simulation"], "summary_hash": "07d70abaea38", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:50:17+00:00"}
