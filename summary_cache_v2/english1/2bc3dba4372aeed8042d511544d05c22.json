{"summary": "The module implements a SegArray class that represents ragged or segmented arrays in the Arkouda framework. It provides methods for creation, indexing, concatenation, aggregation, and other array-like operations while handling the underlying segment offsets and values as distributed pdarrays. Helper utilities support aggregation functions, range generation, and documentation updates.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient manipulation and analysis of variable‑length sub‑arrays in a distributed computing environment, allowing users to perform high‑level analytics on ragged data structures within Arkouda.", "keywords": ["segmented array", "ragged array", "Arkoud a", "distributed computing", "pdarray", "groupby", "aggregation", "indexing", "concatenation", "cumulative sum", "data loading"], "summary_hash": "0c4e3e67bb90", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:23:35+00:00"}
