{"summary": "The module implements Lightning's core optimizer handling. It defines a wrapper that intercepts optimizer operations to correctly manage backward passes, automatic mixed‑precision scaling, gradient accumulation, and accelerator‑specific requirements, while delegating other attributes to the underlying optimizer. It also provides a lightweight mock optimizer for cases where no real optimizer is configured and includes internal utilities for configuring, validating, and managing learning‑rate schedulers.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless integration of user‑defined optimizers into the Lightning training workflow, handling complexities such as mixed‑precision, gradient accumulation, distributed execution, and providing safe defaults when an optimizer is absent.", "keywords": ["optimizer", "wrapper", "gradient accumulation", "automatic mixed precision", "accelerator compatibility", "mock optimizer", "learning rate scheduler", "validation", "training loop", "PyTorch Lightning"], "summary_hash": "34327b6f3cec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:13:50+00:00"}
