{"summary": "This module implements the role management subsystem for distributed DGL clients. It defines serializable request and response messages for registering a client’s role and for querying the role layout of all processes. Global variables track the current role, rank information, and trainer counts, while helper functions expose these values to other components.", "business_intent": "Facilitate coordinated distributed graph learning by allowing each process to declare itself as a sampler or trainer and to discover the roles and ranks of its peers, ensuring correct orchestration of training and sampling tasks.", "keywords": ["distributed", "role management", "client", "trainer", "sampler", "RPC", "serialization", "global rank", "rank", "registration", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "be3e11a253cf", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:38:21+00:00"}
