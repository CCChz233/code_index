{"summary": "Transforms a generic DGL dataset into a standardized node‑prediction dataset by keeping only the first graph, attaching node labels and train/validation/test masks as node attributes, and exposing class count and index tensors. Supports heterogeneous graphs via a target node type and automatically creates and caches split masks according to a user‑specified ratio, re‑processing when the ratio changes.", "business_intent": "Enable fast and consistent preparation of graph data for semi‑supervised transductive node classification models, reducing preprocessing effort and ensuring reproducible train/validation/test splits.", "keywords": ["dataset conversion", "node prediction", "semi-supervised learning", "transductive", "train/validation/test split", "mask caching", "heterogeneous graphs", "DGL", "graph neural networks"], "summary_hash": "d2841e623506", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:46:43+00:00"}
