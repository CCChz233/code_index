{"summary": "Implements a Graph Convolutional Network layer based on the GCNII formulation, which combines normalized adjacency smoothing with a residual connection to the original node features and an adaptive identity‑mapping term. The layer supports optional feature projection, bias, activation, and configurable handling of zero‑in‑degree nodes.", "business_intent": "Enable deep graph neural network models that remain stable and expressive by preserving initial node information and gradually reducing the influence of the weight matrix, facilitating accurate node representation learning in applications such as recommendation, molecular analysis, and social network inference.", "keywords": ["graph convolution", "GCNII", "residual connection", "identity mapping", "deep GNN", "adaptive decay", "initial feature residual", "DGL", "message passing", "zero in-degree handling"], "summary_hash": "c0dcba02f614", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:54:39+00:00"}
