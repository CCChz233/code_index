{"summary": "Implements a diffusion scheduler that applies strategic stochastic sampling based on trajectory consistency distillation, extending multistep consistency sampling to allow flexible, unrestricted traversal of diffusion trajectories. Manages configuration of timesteps, beta schedules, scaling, clipping, and prediction types, and provides the core logic for stepping through the diffusion process, adding noise, and handling model input scaling.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑quality, efficient generation of images or videos in generative AI pipelines by offering an advanced scheduler that improves sample fidelity and flexibility during inference of diffusion models.", "keywords": ["diffusion scheduler", "trajectory consistency distillation", "stochastic sampling", "beta schedule", "timestep scaling", "noise prediction", "dynamic thresholding", "generative AI", "model inference", "consistency model"], "summary_hash": "bdad7cf262f4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:55:58+00:00"}
