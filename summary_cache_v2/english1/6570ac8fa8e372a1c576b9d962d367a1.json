{"summary": "A transformer‑based duplex tagging system that learns to assign normalization tags to tokens for both text‑to‑spoken (TN) and spoken‑to‑text (ITN) conversions. It handles data preparation, model forward passes, inference, post‑processing of tag predictions, and integrates with training, validation, and testing workflows.", "business_intent": "Enable automated, high‑accuracy text normalization and inverse text normalization in speech‑related applications such as voice assistants, transcription services, and speech synthesis pipelines.", "keywords": ["transformer", "duplex tagger", "text normalization", "inverse text normalization", "tag prediction", "model inference", "training pipeline", "validation", "testing", "data loading", "post‑processing", "speech processing"], "summary_hash": "0a3a97b290db", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:05:52+00:00"}
