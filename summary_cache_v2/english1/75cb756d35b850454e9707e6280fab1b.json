{"summary": "This package implements a BLIP‑Diffusion pipeline that combines a BLIP‑2 multimodal encoder (vision and text embeddings, Q‑Former, optional CLIP‑based contextual encoder) with a diffusion model (UNet, VAE, scheduler) to generate images from textual prompts and visual concepts. It includes utilities for preprocessing images, defining the neural components, and orchestrating tokenization, embedding extraction, latent diffusion, and final image decoding.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to perform zero‑shot, subject‑driven text‑to‑image generation without model fine‑tuning, facilitating rapid creation of customized visuals for applications such as content creation, advertising, and prototyping.", "keywords": ["BLIP", "diffusion", "text-to-image", "multimodal", "vision-language", "Q-Former", "image preprocessing", "CLIP", "UNet", "VAE", "zero-shot", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "164a37c7a0b1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:40:28+00:00"}
