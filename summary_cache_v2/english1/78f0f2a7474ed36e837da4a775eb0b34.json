{"summary": "The module provides a complete training pipeline for consistency distillation of Stable Diffusion XL models using LoRA adapters. It loads a dataset, prepares the SDXL UNet and VAE, integrates LoRA, configures diffusion schedulers (including DDIM and LCM), and runs a distributed training loop with Accelerate, handling optimization, learning‑rate scheduling, checkpointing, and optional validation/logging.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to efficiently fine‑tune large diffusion models with parameter‑efficient LoRA and consistency distillation, improving generation speed and quality while leveraging scalable training infrastructure.", "keywords": ["diffusion models", "Stable Diffusion XL", "consistency distillation", "LoRA", "parameter-efficient fine-tuning", "accelerate", "distributed training", "DDIM", "LCM scheduler", "dataset preprocessing", "model checkpointing", "HuggingFace"], "summary_hash": "e0a244da3bbc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:59:04+00:00"}
