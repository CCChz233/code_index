{"summary": "The module defines a generic benchmarking base class and a collection of specialized subclasses that load various diffusion pipelines (e.g., ControlNet, Stable Diffusion XL, IP‑Adapter, LoRA, Turbo) and run inference tasks such as text‑to‑image, image‑to‑image, and inpainting. Each class measures execution time, gathers performance and quality metrics, and writes results to CSV files, providing a unified framework for evaluating model speed and output quality.", "business_intent": "Offer developers and researchers a ready‑to‑use, extensible suite for systematically measuring and comparing the inference performance of diffusion‑based image generation models, enabling data‑driven optimization and reporting.", "keywords": ["benchmarking", "diffusion models", "inference performance", "latency", "image generation", "text-to-image", "image-to-image", "inpainting", "ControlNet", "adapters", "LoRA", "Turbo", "performance metrics", "CSV reporting"], "summary_hash": "2ece987e07f7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:41:49+00:00"}
