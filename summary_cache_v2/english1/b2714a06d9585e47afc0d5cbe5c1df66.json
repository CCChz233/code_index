{"summary": "A differentiable neural‑network layer that performs joint bilateral filtering on tensors of up to three spatial dimensions, using a separate guidance image to guide edge‑aware smoothing. The spatial and intensity (color) kernel widths are learnable parameters, allowing the filter to adapt during training.", "business_intent": "Enable end‑to‑end training of edge‑preserving smoothing operations within deep learning pipelines, particularly for medical imaging tasks such as low‑dose CT reconstruction, to improve prediction stability and image quality.", "keywords": ["trainable joint bilateral filter", "edge‑preserving smoothing", "guidance image", "learnable spatial sigma", "learnable color sigma", "differentiable filtering", "medical imaging", "low-dose CT", "deep learning layer", "torch"], "summary_hash": "7ff1bc7d3c84", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:29:24+00:00"}
