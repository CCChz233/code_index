{"summary": "Implements a lightweight wrapper around Metaflow's Deployer that enables deployment of a flow defined in the active Jupyter notebook cell. It constructs an Argo workflow object, initiates the run, optionally streams stdout/stderr, and manages environment, profile, and working‑directory settings. Includes a dedicated exception for initialization failures.", "business_intent": "Allow data scientists to deploy notebook‑based Metaflow flows directly to Argo without leaving the interactive environment, streamlining the transition from experimentation to production.", "keywords": ["Metaflow", "Deployer", "Jupyter notebook", "NBDeployer", "Argo workflow", "deployment", "streaming output", "environment configuration", "profile management", "working directory", "initialization error"], "summary_hash": "d7f657dc5346", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:04:59+00:00"}
