{"summary": "Represents a quantum circuit as an ordered collection of quantum and classical registers together with a sequence of quantum operations, measurements, and control‑flow constructs. It manages circuit metadata, global phase, parameters, and variable scopes, and provides utilities for adding gates, composing sub‑circuits, and querying circuit properties.", "business_intent": "Enable users to program, analyze, and transform quantum algorithms in a high‑level, hardware‑agnostic form that can be compiled, simulated, or executed on quantum processors.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "quantum registers", "gate operations", "measurement", "parameter handling", "variable scope", "circuit composition", "metadata", "quantum computing", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "7cbf79ca1901", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:05:24+00:00"}
