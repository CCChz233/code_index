{"summary": "The module implements the logic for translating GIS representations of horizontal flow barriers into the input format required by the MODFLOW‑6 HFB package. It defines base and specialized classes that validate barrier data, compute resistance, multiplier, or hydraulic characteristic values, handle layer assignment, perform spatial operations such as clipping, snapping to the model grid, and overlap calculations, and finally produce the dataset consumed by the MODFLOW‑6 adapter.", "business_intent": "Provide groundwater modelers with a robust, automated workflow to incorporate horizontal flow barriers—derived from spatial data—into MODFLOW‑6 simulations, ensuring correct parameter calculation and seamless integration with the model’s grid and package structure.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW-6", "horizontal flow barrier", "groundwater modeling", "GIS", "GeoDataFrame", "resistance", "multiplier", "hydraulic characteristic", "spatial processing", "grid snapping", "data validation", "package generation"], "summary_hash": "eb2b5d5b836f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:47:57+00:00"}
