{"summary": "A unit‑test module that validates the VideoProcessor's handling of synthetic video data across multiple formats (NumPy arrays, PIL images, and PyTorch tensors). It provides helper utilities to generate dummy video samples and to convert processed outputs back to NumPy for assertion checks.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the video processing component works reliably with diverse input types, supporting downstream AI applications such as video generation, editing, or analysis that depend on consistent data handling.", "keywords": ["video processing", "unit testing", "synthetic data", "NumPy", "PIL", "PyTorch", "multi‑dimensional arrays", "diffusers", "parameterized tests", "data conversion"], "summary_hash": "cd450be7ecc7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:45:04+00:00"}
