{"summary": "The module provides a collection of unit‑test utilities and test cases that exercise DGL's integration with PyTorch streams. It includes helpers for timing operations, performing tensor computations and copies, and several tests that check basic stream functionality, stream graph recording (both positive and negative scenarios), ndarray handling, and setting/getting the active CUDA stream.", "business_intent": "Validate that DGL correctly interacts with PyTorch's CUDA streams, ensuring that stream‑related APIs (recording, graph construction, ndarray conversion, and stream management) behave as expected and meet performance expectations.", "keywords": ["DGL", "PyTorch", "CUDA stream", "unit test", "performance measurement", "graph recording", "ndarray", "backend integration", "GPU"], "summary_hash": "7a0782f2b9bd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:07:44+00:00"}
