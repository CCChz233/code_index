{"summary": "The module contains a test suite that exercises the box transformation utilities of the MONAI detection framework. It checks that operations such as converting masks to boxes, affine coordinate mapping, clipping, mode conversion, flipping, cropping, rotating, and zooming produce expected shapes and values for both 2‑D and 3‑D inputs, including masked variants.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability of detection box preprocessing steps in medical imaging pipelines by automatically validating their mathematical correctness across different dimensionalities.", "keywords": ["unit test", "box transformation", "MONAI", "detection", "2D", "3D", "mask conversion", "affine coordinates", "cropping", "flipping", "rotation", "zoom", "validation"], "summary_hash": "351a9ab8567d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:01:02+00:00"}
