{"summary": "The module provides a suite of lightweight dataclass containers that encapsulate hyper‑parameter settings for a wide range of learning‑rate and training schedulers (e.g., cosine annealing, cyclic, exponential, polynomial, warmup, step, ReduceLROnPlateau, etc.). It also includes helper utilities to obtain and register scheduler configurations, allowing these parameter objects to be used independently of the full NeMo Config system.", "business_intent": "To simplify and standardize the definition of scheduler hyper‑parameters for NeMo model training, offering type‑safe, reusable configuration objects that can be easily integrated into training pipelines and configuration workflows.", "keywords": ["scheduler", "learning rate", "hyperparameters", "cosine annealing", "cyclic LR", "exponential LR", "polynomial decay", "warmup", "hold", "step LR", "ReduceLROnPlateau", "dataclass", "NeMo", "configuration"], "summary_hash": "50710d7c0e00", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:40:49+00:00"}
