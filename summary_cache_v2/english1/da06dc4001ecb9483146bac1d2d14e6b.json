{"summary": "Implements a Dask layer that reduces a collection of DataFrame partitions by applying a user‑provided concatenation function followed by a node‑wise processing function in a hierarchical tree structure. It builds the reduction task graph, supports optional finalization on the last node, configurable fan‑in (split_every) and output splitting (split_out), and includes utilities for graph culling and key handling.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, parallel reduction of large DataFrames by aggregating partition data through a configurable tree reduction, improving performance and memory usage for operations such as aggregations, summaries, or custom reductions.", "keywords": ["dataframe", "reduction", "tree", "partition", "concat", "node", "finalize", "split_every", "split_out", "dask", "task graph", "culling", "parallel", "aggregation"], "summary_hash": "ef91891d5a38", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:09:53+00:00"}
