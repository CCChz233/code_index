{"summary": "This module implements a reusable mixin that equips Lightning classes with comprehensive hyperparameter management, automatically capturing initialization arguments, storing them, exposing them as dictionaries, and supporting persistence. It also includes a lightweight context manager for temporarily overriding hyperparameters within a scoped block.", "business_intent": "Provide developers building Lightning models with a streamlined way to handle, serialize, and restore model hyperparameters, improving reproducibility, configurability, and integration with Lightning's training infrastructure.", "keywords": ["hyperparameters", "mixin", "PyTorch Lightning", "configuration management", "serialization", "context manager", "attribute dictionary", "model initialization", "parameter persistence", "training reproducibility"], "summary_hash": "0397b1d3f6d6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:01:42+00:00"}
