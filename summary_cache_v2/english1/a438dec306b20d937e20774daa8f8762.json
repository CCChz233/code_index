{"summary": "This module implements the Hydrawise cloud integration for Home Assistant. It defines a generic entity class for Hydrawise devices, a hub model representing the controller, configuration validation, constants, and the logic for registering entities, handling periodic updates, and dispatching state changes. The integration exposes sensors, binary sensors, and switches that reflect irrigation status and allow control of watering schedules via the Hydrawise API.", "business_intent": "Allow Home Assistant users to monitor and control Hydrawise irrigation systems through a cloud‑based interface, providing automated scheduling, real‑time status reporting, and remote operation of watering zones.", "keywords": ["hydrawise", "home assistant", "irrigation", "cloud integration", "sensor", "switch", "binary sensor", "entity", "hub", "API", "watering schedule", "automation"], "summary_hash": "1a4eef2cc28a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:45:56+00:00"}
