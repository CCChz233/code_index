{"summary": "The file provides a suite of unit tests for Qiskit's BackendSampler primitive, exercising sampling operations, job lifecycle handling, callback integration, backend conversion, and constraints such as maximum circuits per job. It includes a dummy analysis pass that triggers a user callback and a mock V2 backend that enforces circuit limits to verify sampler behavior under restricted conditions.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correctness and robustness of the BackendSampler primitive across diverse backends and usage scenarios, ensuring reliable quantum circuit sampling and proper job management in production Qiskit deployments.", "keywords": ["BackendSampler", "Qiskit", "unit testing", "quantum circuit sampling", "backend compatibility", "job status", "callback pass", "fake backend", "circuit limit", "transpiler", "primitive validation"], "summary_hash": "35450522cd10", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:44:34+00:00"}
