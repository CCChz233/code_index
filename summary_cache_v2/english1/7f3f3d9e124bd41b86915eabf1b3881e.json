{"summary": "A command‑line utility that evaluates CTC‑based speech segmentation results. It loads audio segment metadata, computes alignment metrics such as edit distance‑based error rates, aggregates these statistics, applies user‑defined quality filters, and writes the filtered metrics to JSON files, optionally using parallel processing for speed.", "business_intent": "Provide automated quality assessment and pruning of speech segmentation outputs to improve downstream ASR training and analysis pipelines.", "keywords": ["CTC segmentation", "speech recognition", "error metrics", "edit distance", "filtering", "audio processing", "parallel execution", "JSON reporting"], "summary_hash": "5a2ac9e6e641", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:24:33+00:00"}
