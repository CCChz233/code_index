{"summary": "The module implements a hierarchical attention network for heterogeneous graph data using PyTorch and DGL. It provides a semantic attention component to weight feature representations, a graph neural network layer that aggregates node features across multiple meta‑path derived homogeneous graphs with multi‑head attention and dropout, and a top‑level model that stacks these layers to generate node embeddings for downstream tasks.", "business_intent": "Enable representation learning on heterogeneous graphs for applications such as recommendation, social network analysis, and knowledge‑graph mining, facilitating tasks like node classification and link prediction.", "keywords": ["hierarchical attention", "heterogeneous graph", "meta‑path", "graph neural network", "multi‑head attention", "semantic attention", "PyTorch", "DGL", "node embedding", "representation learning"], "summary_hash": "64740ac6f99a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:13:45+00:00"}
