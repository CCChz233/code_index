{"summary": "The AHNet class defines a deep neural network architecture for medical image segmentation, supporting both 2D and 3D inputs. It builds a series of residual blocks, optionally incorporates a pyramid pooling module, and uses configurable upsampling methods (transpose convolution, bilinear, trilinear, or nearest neighbor) to reconstruct the output resolution. The network also includes functionality to initialize its weights from a pretrained ResNet50 model and enforces input size constraints for compatibility.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, high‑performance segmentation model for medical imaging applications, allowing researchers and clinicians to leverage a robust architecture with optional pretrained weights and customizable upsampling strategies for accurate and efficient analysis of volumetric data.", "keywords": ["AHNet", "medical image segmentation", "2D/3D support", "residual blocks", "pyramid pooling", "upsampling methods", "transpose convolution", "bilinear interpolation", "trilinear interpolation", "nearest neighbor", "pretrained ResNet50", "input size constraints"], "summary_hash": "44b549d299de", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:19:39+00:00"}
