{"summary": "Defines a parameterized circuit template that realizes a CNOT (CX) gate using an RZX interaction flanked by single‑qubit Y‑ and X‑rotations (RY and RX). The template can be invoked by the Qiskit transpiler to replace CX with a native‑gate‑friendly decomposition.", "business_intent": "Enable hardware‑aware compilation by expressing CX in terms of the native RZX gate, thereby improving execution efficiency and fidelity on quantum processors that support RZX as a primitive two‑qubit operation.", "keywords": ["RZX", "CNOT", "CX", "quantum circuit template", "Qiskit", "gate decomposition", "parameterized circuit", "RX", "RY", "transpiler optimization", "hardware‑native gate"], "summary_hash": "a3a5563d46c5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:20:54+00:00"}
