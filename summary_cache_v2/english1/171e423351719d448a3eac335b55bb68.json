{"summary": "The module defines a command‑line driven workflow for fine‑tuning a sequence‑classification model to predict reward scores. It includes argument handling for hardware configuration, a data collator that pads reward samples, a custom trainer that computes reward‑specific loss, and a callback that evaluates the model after the first training step. Supporting utilities compute evaluation metrics and (unused) preprocessing logic.", "business_intent": "To enable the training of a reward model that can assign scores to model outputs, facilitating reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for improving language model behavior.", "keywords": ["reward modeling", "sequence classification", "LoRA", "PEFT", "Hugging Face Transformers", "accelerate", "custom trainer", "evaluation callback"], "summary_hash": "ee45c1685752", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:03:41+00:00"}
