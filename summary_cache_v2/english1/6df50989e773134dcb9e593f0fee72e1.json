{"summary": "A dictionary‑based transform that randomly zooms selected image (and related) tensors according to a configurable probability and zoom range. It supports per‑axis zoom factors, various interpolation and padding modes, optional size preservation, dtype handling, and can operate lazily to defer actual resampling until needed.", "business_intent": "Enhance training data variability for deep learning models, particularly in medical imaging pipelines, by applying stochastic zoom augmentations while maintaining alignment with associated metadata and optimizing performance through lazy execution.", "keywords": ["random zoom", "data augmentation", "lazy resampling", "interpolation", "padding", "multi-key transform", "probability", "medical imaging", "MONAI", "dictionary-based transform"], "summary_hash": "a6f762144e4a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:09:25+00:00"}
