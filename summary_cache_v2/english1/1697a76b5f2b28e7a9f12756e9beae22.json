{"summary": "The module defines a Flax implementation of the Pseudo Numerical Diffusion Model (PNDM) scheduler, which is used for controlling the diffusion process in generative models. It provides functionality to compute timesteps, add noise, and step through the diffusion process using the PNDM algorithm. The scheduler supports various configurations such as prediction type, beta schedule, and variance type, and includes methods for initializing and updating the scheduler state.", "business_intent": "The purpose of this module is to provide a Flax implementation of the PNDM scheduler for diffusion models, which can be used in various applications such as image generation, text-to-image generation, and other generative tasks.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "PNDM", "Flax", "JAX", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "44cd5633943f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:14:40+00:00"}
