{"summary": "The module supplies a reusable test mixin that rigorously checks a user‑provided implementation of Dask's `get` function against a variety of simple, nested, list‑based, and high‑level task graphs, handling edge cases such as missing keys and recursion limits. It also includes a collection of lightweight helper utilities used within the test suite.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that custom graph‑execution functions behave consistently with Dask's expectations, facilitating reliable extensions and custom scheduling strategies while providing supporting test helpers.", "keywords": ["Dask", "testing", "graph traversal", "get function validation", "task graph", "mixins", "utility helpers", "high‑level graph", "software reliability"], "summary_hash": "24c3841aa7a4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:16:24+00:00"}
