{"summary": "The module supplies Dask‑array utilities for Fast Fourier Transform operations, including functions that compute output chunk layouts, wrap FFT calls, and generate frequency‑bin arrays or perform FFT‑related shifts. Most helpers are simple wrappers around NumPy functionality, adapted to Dask’s chunked, parallel array model, with several placeholder functions awaiting future use.", "business_intent": "Enable large‑scale, distributed FFT‑related calculations within the Dask ecosystem by providing chunk‑aware helpers for frequency generation, array shifting, and FFT wrappers, thereby supporting scientific and engineering workloads that require parallel processing of massive datasets.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "fft", "frequency bins", "chunking", "distributed computing", "numpy", "fftshift", "ifftshift", "rfftfreq"], "summary_hash": "bcba8f9e5512", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:17:56+00:00"}
