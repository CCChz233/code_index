{"summary": "The FDA class implements a Fourier‑domain style‑transfer augmentation that aligns the low‑frequency spectrum of a source image with that of one or more reference target images. By swapping low‑frequency components in the Fourier transform, it creates a version of the source image that visually resembles the target domain while preserving semantic content, enabling unsupervised domain adaptation for tasks such as semantic segmentation.", "business_intent": "To close the distribution gap between training and deployment image domains without additional model training, thereby improving model generalisation and performance on target data that differs in style, lighting, or synthetic‑real characteristics.", "keywords": ["Fourier transform", "domain adaptation", "style transfer", "low‑frequency swapping", "unsupervised", "image augmentation", "semantic segmentation", "beta limit", "reference images", "frequency domain"], "summary_hash": "defc20a5dfda", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:23:53+00:00"}
