{"summary": "The module implements a comprehensive suite of geometric augmentation transforms that modify images while synchronously updating associated annotations such as masks, bounding boxes, and keypoints. It includes flips, rotations, scaling, padding, perspective warps, elastic and grid‑based distortions, thin‑plate spline warps, dihedral symmetries, and optical distortions, all configurable with probabilities, interpolation options, and border handling.", "business_intent": "Offer flexible, probabilistic geometric augmentations to enrich training datasets for computer‑vision models, improving their robustness to variations in viewpoint, scale, distortion, and image layout.", "keywords": ["affine", "elastic deformation", "grid distortion", "perspective warp", "piecewise affine", "thin plate spline", "horizontal flip", "vertical flip", "transpose", "pad", "pad if needed", "random grid shuffle", "shift scale rotate", "optical distortion", "dihedral symmetry", "geometric augmentation", "image augmentation", "mask augmentation", "bounding box transformation", "keypoint transformation", "computer vision", "data augmentation"], "summary_hash": "3caf9a13be41", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:30:22+00:00"}
