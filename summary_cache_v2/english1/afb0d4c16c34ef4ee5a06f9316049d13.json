{"summary": "The module defines a River class that encapsulates the MODFLOW‑6 river boundary package. It stores and validates river stage, hydraulic conductance, bottom elevation, and optional solute concentration arrays, and handles package options such as printing, budgeting, and repeat‑stress specifications. The class integrates with discretization, allocation, conductance distribution, and regridding utilities to prepare river boundary data for groundwater simulations.", "business_intent": "Enable modelers to efficiently create, configure, and apply river boundary conditions within MODFLOW‑6 simulations, ensuring data consistency, proper spatial allocation, and compatibility with model regridding and budgeting workflows.", "keywords": ["river boundary", "MODFLOW-6", "groundwater modeling", "stage array", "hydraulic conductance", "bottom elevation", "solute concentration", "budget printing", "repeat stress", "data validation", "spatial allocation", "conductance distribution", "regridding", "discretization", "drainage", "simulation preparation"], "summary_hash": "e2805afa12bf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:48:20+00:00"}
