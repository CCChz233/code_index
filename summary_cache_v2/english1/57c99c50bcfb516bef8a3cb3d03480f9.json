{"summary": "This module implements foundational utilities for handling Dask task graphs, including mechanisms to retrieve values, analyze dependencies, verify task structures, perform topological ordering, and manage literal values without copying. It also provides helpers for hashing, key validation, and graph traversal.", "business_intent": "Enable Dask's parallel execution engine to efficiently schedule and execute computations by offering low‑level graph manipulation and analysis tools that resolve task dependencies, ensure correct ordering, and handle immutable literals safely.", "keywords": ["dask", "task graph", "dependency analysis", "topological sort", "graph utilities", "literal wrapper", "hashability", "key validation", "parallel computation"], "summary_hash": "b7087d4917b6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:16:54+00:00"}
