{"summary": "The module implements lazy‑evaluation utilities that verify the availability of optional Python packages or external command‑line tools only when they are actually needed. It supplies wrapper objects that defer import or subprocess checks until a boolean test or explicit request, and raises consistent errors or warnings if the required optional dependency is absent.", "business_intent": "Enable the library to support optional features without hard dependencies, improving robustness and user experience by preventing import failures and allowing conditional activation of functionality based on the presence of external libraries or tools.", "keywords": ["lazy loading", "optional dependency", "import check", "subprocess verification", "runtime dependency detection", "missing library handling", "conditional feature enablement", "dependency manager"], "summary_hash": "999233d68359", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:49:39+00:00"}
