{"summary": "The module offers a simple PyTorch Dataset implementation that encapsulates a list of sentence InputExample objects, exposing indexing and length operations for integration with data loaders. It is deprecated in favor of using the raw list directly.", "business_intent": "Maintain backward compatibility for training and evaluation pipelines that rely on a Dataset wrapper for sentence examples, while guiding developers toward a more streamlined approach of passing the example list without an extra wrapper.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "Dataset", "sentence transformer", "InputExample", "deprecation", "data loading", "wrapper", "list of sentences"], "summary_hash": "d28a2dd7f146", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:52:05+00:00"}
