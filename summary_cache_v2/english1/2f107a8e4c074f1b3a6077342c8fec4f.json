{"summary": "A test suite that rigorously checks CuPy's polynomial capabilities—including creation, arithmetic, exponentiation, fitting, evaluation, root finding, and error handling across different data types and dimensions—and validates CuPy's low‑level strided utilities for creating array views and rolling windows by comparing their behavior with NumPy equivalents.", "business_intent": "Ensure functional parity and reliability of CuPy's polynomial and strided‑trick modules with NumPy, providing regression protection and confidence that these features work correctly for diverse inputs and use cases.", "keywords": ["CuPy", "polynomial", "strided tricks", "rolling window", "unit tests", "NumPy compatibility", "array views", "multi-dimensional", "fitting", "evaluation", "root finding", "error handling", "regression testing"], "summary_hash": "616b3036e47a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:35:41+00:00"}
