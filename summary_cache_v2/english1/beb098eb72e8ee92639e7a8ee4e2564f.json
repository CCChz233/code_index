{"summary": "The module provides unit tests that verify the behavior of a best‑of‑N sampling utility for causal language models, checking that it correctly handles different input formats, sample sizes, and candidate counts, and that it selects the highest‑scoring outputs. It also includes a small helper to map query strings to mock scores.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and robustness of the best‑of‑N sampling component used in language model generation pipelines, ensuring reliable selection of top candidates for downstream applications such as content creation, recommendation, or model evaluation.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "best-of-n sampling", "language model generation", "transformers", "torch", "candidate selection", "score evaluation", "software quality assurance"], "summary_hash": "5f4b8a837993", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:58:39+00:00"}
