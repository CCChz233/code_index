{"summary": "This module implements the core driver for Cython’s compilation workflow. It defines data structures that capture the outcome of compiling a single source file or a set of files, encapsulates the compilation environment (options, search paths, language settings, and error handling), and provides functions that parse command‑line arguments, locate modules, invoke the compilation pipeline, and coordinate the generation of C code, headers, and compiled extensions.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and build tools to translate Cython/Pyrex source code into C and binary extensions through a unified interface, supporting both command‑line usage and programmatic invocation while managing dependencies, options, and error reporting.", "keywords": ["Cython", "compilation driver", "command line", "build pipeline", "source file handling", "result aggregation", "module discovery", "error management", "options processing", "extension building"], "summary_hash": "652f7ce5b67b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:26:39+00:00"}
