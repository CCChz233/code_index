{"summary": "This module implements a distributed algorithm that approximates evenly‑spaced percentiles across all partitions of a Dask DataFrame. By summarizing each partition with weighted percentile samples, merging those summaries in a reduction tree, and periodically compressing them, it produces a set of division values (including global min and max) that can be used to define new partition boundaries when re‑indexing or repartitioning large datasets.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, one‑pass method for estimating partition boundaries so that Dask can efficiently repartition or change the index of massive DataFrames without costly full‑data shuffles, thereby improving performance and resource usage in distributed data processing pipelines.", "keywords": ["dask", "dataframe", "partition", "quantiles", "percentiles", "approximate", "distributed", "summarization", "merge", "compress", "repartition", "index"], "summary_hash": "9aed499e8b89", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:21:20+00:00"}
