{"summary": "This module defines a MetricLogger handler that integrates with MONAI training workflows to collect loss values and evaluation metrics at each iteration, optionally using an evaluator. It stores the aggregated data for checkpoint serialization and later visualization or analysis, and includes a helper to extract loss from model outputs.", "business_intent": "Enable systematic tracking and persistence of training and evaluation performance metrics, allowing data scientists and engineers to monitor model training, debug issues, compare experiments, and generate reports for stakeholders.", "keywords": ["training", "loss", "metrics", "logging", "checkpoint", "visualization", "MONAI", "handler", "evaluation", "model performance", "iteration", "data collection"], "summary_hash": "a75bcc29f2e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:09:04+00:00"}
