{"summary": "Provides utilities to generate a visual representation of a Qiskit PassManager, organizing passes by their flow controllers and applying distinct colors according to pass categories (analysis, transformation, generic, controller). The module builds sub‑graphs and assembles output files for the overall pass pipeline diagram.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to inspect, debug, and communicate the structure of quantum circuit transpilation workflows by visualizing the sequence and hierarchy of passes within a PassManager.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "PassManager", "visualization", "graph", "transpilation", "flow controller", "analysis pass", "transformation pass", "debugging"], "summary_hash": "66c229556d99", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:50:16+00:00"}
