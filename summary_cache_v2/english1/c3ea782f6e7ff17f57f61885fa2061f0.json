{"summary": "A test script that validates the ability of the Accelerate library combined with DeepSpeed to manage multiple models in a distributed setting. It prepares a dataset, tokenizes inputs, creates data loaders, defines a simple noise‑generation model, and runs training scenarios where one model trains while another provides inference logits, as well as a scenario where two models train concurrently with separate optimizers and schedules.", "business_intent": "To provide confidence to developers that multi‑model workflows can be reliably executed with Accelerate and DeepSpeed, enabling complex training pipelines that involve simultaneous training and inference across several models in a scalable, GPU‑accelerated environment.", "keywords": ["Accelerate", "DeepSpeed", "multi-model training", "distributed training", "PyTorch", "Transformers", "dataset loading", "tokenization", "evaluation", "noise model", "collate function"], "summary_hash": "d4065993a88e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:20:15+00:00"}
