{"summary": "Implements a high‑level pipeline that transforms natural‑language prompts into video frames using a diffusion model. It orchestrates tokenization, dual text encoding, latent encoding/decoding with a VAE, 3‑D transformer denoising, scheduler stepping, and classifier‑free guidance, while managing input validation and runtime options such as VAE slicing/tiling and interruption handling.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to automatically generate short video clips from textual descriptions, supporting rapid prototyping, creative media production, and integration into applications that require AI‑driven video synthesis.", "keywords": ["text‑to‑video", "diffusion pipeline", "latent denoising", "3D transformer", "scheduler", "variational auto‑encoder", "dual text encoder", "T5", "CLIP", "classifier‑free guidance", "tokenization", "AI video generation"], "summary_hash": "ee8f0b48c249", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:40:21+00:00"}
