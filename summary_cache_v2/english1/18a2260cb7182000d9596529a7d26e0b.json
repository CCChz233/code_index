{"summary": "Utility module that supplies a collection of helper routines for loading, transforming, and preprocessing graph data used in P‑GNN experiments. It handles tasks such as retrieving graphs and associated metadata, computing all‑pairs shortest paths, selecting anchor nodes, managing communities, generating positive/negative edge samples, converting graph directionality, and orchestrating parallel preprocessing with progress reporting.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient preparation of graph datasets for training and evaluating graph neural network models by providing reusable functions for data extraction, distance computation, anchor selection, and edge sampling, thereby streamlining the experimental workflow.", "keywords": ["graph preprocessing", "graph neural network", "P‑GNN", "shortest path", "anchor selection", "community detection", "edge splitting", "negative sampling", "multiprocessing", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "b518d46c15a8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:16:32+00:00"}
