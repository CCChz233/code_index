{"summary": "This module implements a collection of graph‑level aggregation utilities for DGL. It offers functions to combine node or edge attributes across a batch of graphs using operations such as sum, mean, max, softmax and top‑k, as well as helpers for broadcasting values between nodes and edges.", "business_intent": "Enable deep‑learning models built on DGL to efficiently compute graph‑level representations by aggregating node and edge features across multiple graphs in a batch.", "keywords": ["graph neural networks", "readout", "aggregation", "sum", "mean", "max", "softmax", "top‑k", "node features", "edge features", "batching", "DGL", "segment operations"], "summary_hash": "669c07e71591", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:35:14+00:00"}
