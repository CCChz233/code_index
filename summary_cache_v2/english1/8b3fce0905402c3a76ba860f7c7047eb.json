{"summary": "A collection of unit tests for CuPy’s miscellaneous utilities, covering memory‑range detection to determine if arrays share underlying storage and the variable‑identification helper that reports variable names and scopes. The tests exercise a wide range of scenarios, including slices, non‑contiguous layouts, complex dtypes, zero‑size arrays, global/local contexts, and edge‑case boundary conditions.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and robustness of CuPy’s helper functions to prevent regressions, ensure compatibility with diverse data structures, and maintain reliable behavior in scientific computing workflows.", "keywords": ["CuPy", "unit tests", "memory range", "array sharing", "who utility", "variable identification", "edge cases", "global scope", "local scope", "complex dtype", "zero‑size array"], "summary_hash": "51efa9080709", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:36:12+00:00"}
