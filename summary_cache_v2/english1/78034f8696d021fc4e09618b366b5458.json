{"summary": "The module defines high‑performance loss functions for RNN‑Transducer based speech recognition models, exposing PyTorch‑compatible loss modules that leverage Numba JIT compilation. It supports configurable blank symbols, various reduction strategies, FastEmit regularization, optional gradient clipping, and specialized variants such as multi‑blank and token‑and‑duration transducer losses.", "business_intent": "Accelerate the training of automatic speech recognition (ASR) models that use the RNN‑Transducer architecture by providing fast, GPU‑compatible loss computations, thereby reducing training time and resource consumption for developers building speech‑to‑text systems.", "keywords": ["RNNT loss", "Numba", "PyTorch", "speech recognition", "ASR", "transducer", "FastEmit", "gradient clipping", "multi‑blank", "token‑duration", "high‑performance"], "summary_hash": "5c0b204fa20a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:16:38+00:00"}
