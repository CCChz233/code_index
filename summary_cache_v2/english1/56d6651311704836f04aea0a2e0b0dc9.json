{"summary": "This module prepares tidal forcing data for ROMS simulations. It reads tidal constituent information, computes equilibrium tides, applies corrections, regrids the data onto the model grid, interpolates to staggered velocity points, rotates velocities to align with the grid orientation, and writes the resulting datasets to NetCDF files.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate and automated generation of tidal boundary conditions for ocean modeling workflows, improving model fidelity and reducing manual preprocessing effort.", "keywords": ["tidal forcing", "equilibrium tide", "TPXO", "regridding", "interpolation", "velocity rotation", "ROMS", "ocean modeling", "NetCDF", "boundary conditions"], "summary_hash": "62ecd63129b1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:15:52+00:00"}
