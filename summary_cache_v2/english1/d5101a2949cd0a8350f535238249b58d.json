{"summary": "Integration test module that validates the end‑to‑end GAN training workflow using MONAI. It generates synthetic 2D images, builds simple generator and discriminator networks, defines loss functions, configures a GanTrainer with checkpoint and statistics handlers, runs a brief training loop, and asserts successful execution.", "business_intent": "Automate regression testing of the GAN training pipeline to ensure that changes to the codebase do not break the integrated workflow, thereby maintaining reliability of the deep‑learning model training process.", "keywords": ["GAN", "training", "integration test", "MONAI", "generator", "discriminator", "checkpoint", "tensorboard", "data transforms", "determinism", "PyTorch", "unit testing"], "summary_hash": "2467570783b7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:51:57+00:00"}
