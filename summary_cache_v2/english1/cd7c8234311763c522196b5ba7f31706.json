{"summary": "The module defines wrapper utilities that encapsulate HTTPX clients for both asynchronous and synchronous communication with the Agenta backend. It centralises configuration such as the service base URL and default headers, manages client creation and cleanup, and offers a simplified, thread‑safe interface for higher‑level code to perform API calls.", "business_intent": "To abstract away the complexities of direct HTTPX usage, ensuring consistent configuration and reliable lifecycle handling for API interactions in the Agenta CLI, thereby enabling developers to make backend requests without managing client details manually.", "keywords": ["HTTPX", "client wrapper", "asynchronous", "synchronous", "base URL", "default headers", "lifecycle management", "thread‑safe", "API client", "Agenta CLI"], "summary_hash": "93f675d40b53", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:23:09+00:00"}
