{"summary": "This module defines a comprehensive suite of unit tests that validate arithmetic and reduction operations on Dask DataFrames and Series. The tests cover element‑wise arithmetic, scalar interactions, handling of different index alignments, numeric‑only semantics, datetime and timedelta reductions, NaN handling, deterministic naming of generated columns, and compatibility with pandas and Arrow execution backends.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that Dask's DataFrame arithmetic and aggregation functions behave consistently with pandas, correctly handle edge cases such as missing values, different data types, and execution environments, and maintain stable API semantics for downstream analytical workloads.", "keywords": ["dask", "dataframe", "unit tests", "arithmetic", "reduction", "numeric_only", "datetime", "timedelta", "NaN", "scalar operations", "deterministic naming", "pandas compatibility", "arrow execution", "aggregation", "standard deviation", "sum", "count", "skew", "kurtosis"], "summary_hash": "067e2c41dd58", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:24:13+00:00"}
