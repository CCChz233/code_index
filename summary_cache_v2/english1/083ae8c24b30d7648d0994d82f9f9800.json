{"summary": "The module defines a collection of lightweight helper classes (blocks) that encapsulate specific aspects of CMake toolchain generation for Conan packages, such as system information, compiler settings, architecture handling, flags, variables, output directories, and platform‑specific configurations. These blocks provide context, templating support, and utilities to assemble a complete CMake toolchain file in a modular and extensible way.", "business_intent": "Enable Conan to automatically generate accurate, platform‑aware CMake toolchain files by breaking down the configuration into reusable, isolated blocks that handle system detection, compiler options, build flags, and other environment details, simplifying cross‑compilation and integration with various operating systems and IDEs.", "keywords": ["CMake", "toolchain", "Conan", "template blocks", "system detection", "compiler configuration", "architecture handling", "cross‑compilation", "build flags", "variables", "output directories", "platform specific"], "summary_hash": "3cea8816bcfd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:03:46+00:00"}
