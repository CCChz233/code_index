{"summary": "This module implements a comprehensive simulation of cardio‑metabolic disorders, handling the acquisition, remission, emergency events, mortality, weight‑loss interventions, and health‑system interactions for conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart attack, and chronic lower back pain. It updates individual risk profiles, schedules diagnostic and treatment activities, records outcomes, and aggregates metrics for reporting.", "business_intent": "To provide a detailed population‑level model of cardio‑metabolic disease dynamics and associated health‑care processes, enabling analysis of disease burden, intervention effectiveness, and resource needs for health policy and planning.", "keywords": ["cardio‑metabolic", "diabetes", "hypertension", "chronic kidney disease", "ischemic heart disease", "stroke", "heart attack", "lower back pain", "simulation", "risk modeling", "event handling", "mortality", "weight loss", "treatment", "health‑system interaction", "tracking", "epidemiology"], "summary_hash": "8c9b3aa8530d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:47:42+00:00"}
