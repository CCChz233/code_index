{"summary": "A collection of unit tests that verify the analytical dispersion solvers for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, STIX, and two‑fluid plasma models. The tests compare computed angular frequencies, group velocities, and related quantities against reference values, ensure correct output formatting, and confirm that invalid inputs trigger appropriate exceptions and warnings.", "business_intent": "Provide confidence in the scientific accuracy and robustness of the analytical dispersion calculations used in plasma physics research and software, supporting reliable simulations and downstream analyses.", "keywords": ["plasma physics", "dispersion relation", "analytical models", "MHD wave", "STIX", "two-fluid", "unit testing", "validation", "numerical accuracy", "error handling", "warnings"], "summary_hash": "797d3a3dbb0e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:16:19+00:00"}
