{"summary": "This module provides unit tests aimed at validating the behavior of secret verification suppression mechanisms, including altering check results to a skipped state and ensuring the runner correctly handles skip directives for all or invalid secrets. The tests appear to be unused in the current codebase, suggesting they may be placeholder or dead code.", "business_intent": "Validate that secret scanning can respect suppression rules by converting failing checks to skipped results and that the scanning runner properly applies skip configurations for all secrets or only invalid suppressed secrets.", "keywords": ["secrets", "verification", "suppression", "unit test", "check result", "skip", "runner", "mock", "responses", "os"], "summary_hash": "264e157075a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:58:30+00:00"}
