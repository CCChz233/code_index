{"summary": "The module implements configurable decoding utilities for Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN‑T) speech models. It defines abstract and concrete decoder classes that combine encoder outputs with prediction and joint networks, supporting multiple decoding strategies (greedy, beam search, time‑synchronous decoding, alignment‑restricted decoding) and optional generation of token strings, alignments, timestamps, language identifiers, and confidence metrics.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible, high‑performance inference for speech‑to‑text systems by providing a unified interface that can switch between decoding algorithms and produce detailed confidence information for downstream applications such as transcription quality assessment, active learning, or multilingual handling.", "keywords": ["RNN‑T", "decoding", "greedy", "beam search", "time‑synchronous decoding", "alignment‑restricted decoding", "confidence scoring", "tokenization", "alignment", "timestamps", "language ID", "speech recognition", "inference"], "summary_hash": "b13382802aaa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:16:09+00:00"}
