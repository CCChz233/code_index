{"summary": "A model class that encapsulates a UniSpeech SAT architecture tailored for sequence classification tasks on speech data. It manages model initialization, processes inputs through a forward computation pipeline, and offers utilities to selectively lock the base network, feature encoder, or feature extractor layers for transfer‑learning scenarios.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to quickly deploy and fine‑tune a pre‑trained speech representation model for classification applications, while providing control over which components are trainable to optimize performance and resource usage.", "keywords": ["speech", "sequence classification", "UniSpeech", "SAT", "model freezing", "transfer learning", "feature encoder", "feature extractor", "deep learning", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "01e7a1b4ce1d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:05:22+00:00"}
