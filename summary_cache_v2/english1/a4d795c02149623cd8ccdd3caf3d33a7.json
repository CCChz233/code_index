{"summary": "The module defines utilities for loading image data with region‑of‑interest masks, including preprocessing of inputs, post‑processing of outputs, and a wrapper to coordinate masked loading. It leverages Zarr, Dask, and upscaling functions to handle large datasets, though the current functions are not referenced elsewhere in the codebase.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable component that enables efficient, masked loading and handling of ROI data in high‑throughput imaging pipelines, facilitating downstream analysis and processing of selected image regions.", "keywords": ["masked loading", "region of interest", "ROI", "upscaling", "Zarr", "Dask", "image processing", "preprocessing", "postprocessing", "data handling"], "summary_hash": "8ac749ca3d5b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:55:16+00:00"}
