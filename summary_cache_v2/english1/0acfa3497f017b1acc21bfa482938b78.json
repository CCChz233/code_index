{"summary": "This module implements a GroupBy class that partitions one or more Arkouda arrays into groups based on key columns, computes sorting permutations, unique key sets, and segment boundaries, and provides a collection of statistical and logical aggregation methods for each group. It also defines a reduction type enumeration for describing the kind of aggregation performed.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑performance, pandas‑like group‑by operations on large distributed datasets within the Arkouda environment, allowing users to efficiently summarize and analyze data through common reductions such as sum, count, min, max, and logical predicates.", "keywords": ["groupby", "aggregation", "reduction", "sorting permutation", "unique keys", "segment boundaries", "distributed arrays", "Arkoud a", "statistical summary", "logical reduction", "enumeration"], "summary_hash": "771696686830", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:22:57+00:00"}
