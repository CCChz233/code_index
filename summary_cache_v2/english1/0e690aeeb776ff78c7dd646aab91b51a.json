{"summary": "Defines a PyTorch‑compatible loss module that implements the contrastive loss formulation from Chen et al. (2020). The loss measures similarity between paired inputs that belong to the same class and enforces dissimilarity for pairs from different classes, enabling the network to learn discriminative feature embeddings.", "business_intent": "Provides a ready‑to‑use loss component for training deep learning models—particularly in medical imaging—to improve representation learning and downstream performance on tasks such as classification or segmentation.", "keywords": ["contrastive loss", "representation learning", "positive pairs", "negative pairs", "similarity", "dissimilarity", "deep learning", "medical imaging", "PyTorch", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "e6f333791973", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:14:14+00:00"}
