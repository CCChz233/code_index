{"summary": "Defines a minimal, unified tensor backend interface for DGL, offering a comprehensive set of tensor creation, manipulation, reduction, and sparse operations, along with utilities for device handling, gradient control, and node embedding management. The module abstracts over underlying deep‑learning frameworks, exposing context managers to enable/disable gradient tracking and to record gradients, while allowing optional implementation of each operation.", "business_intent": "Provide DGL with a framework‑agnostic tensor layer that standardizes graph‑centric computations, simplifies integration with various deep‑learning backends, and supports efficient training of graph neural networks through consistent APIs and gradient management.", "keywords": ["tensor abstraction", "DGL backend", "graph neural networks", "gradient control", "sparse embeddings", "device management", "unified API", "deep learning framework integration"], "summary_hash": "ce4431ae2582", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:38:06+00:00"}
