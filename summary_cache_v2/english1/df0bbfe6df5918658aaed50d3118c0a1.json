{"summary": "This module implements a Scanner class that serves as the central controller for conducting software composition analysis (SCA) scans. It prepares scan requests, initiates them through the Bridgecrew platform API, continuously polls for completion using configurable back‑off logic, and finally retrieves and returns the scan findings. The class also manages logging, progress indication, and error handling for network or decoding issues.", "business_intent": "To provide an automated, programmatic way to execute SCA scans against the Bridgecrew service, enabling integration of security checks into development pipelines and delivering actionable vulnerability data for compliance and risk mitigation.", "keywords": ["scanner", "software composition analysis", "SCA", "Bridgecrew", "API integration", "polling", "progress bar", "retry logic", "environment configuration", "vulnerability results"], "summary_hash": "a786a18dab62", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T19:25:44+00:00"}
