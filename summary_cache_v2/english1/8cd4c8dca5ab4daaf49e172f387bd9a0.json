{"summary": "A dataset wrapper for the KITTI semantic segmentation benchmark that loads image and mask files, removes irrelevant (void) classes, maps the remaining class IDs to a contiguous range, resizes both images and masks to a configurable size, and optionally applies image‑only transformations, while exposing standard indexing and length operations for seamless integration with training pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient preparation and loading of KITTI semantic segmentation data for model training and evaluation, ensuring correct label handling and preprocessing to improve model performance.", "keywords": ["KITTI", "semantic segmentation", "dataset wrapper", "label encoding", "void classes", "valid classes", "image preprocessing", "mask resizing", "data loading", "training pipeline"], "summary_hash": "4dab9b80add0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:07:32+00:00"}
