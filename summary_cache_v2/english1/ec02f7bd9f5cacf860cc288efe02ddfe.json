{"summary": "A TensorFlow training script that builds, trains, and evaluates a Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) model on standard citation graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) using DGL utilities. It parses command‑line arguments, constructs the DGI encoder and a downstream classifier, runs the unsupervised training loop, and reports classification accuracy.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate how to apply unsupervised graph representation learning for node classification, providing a ready‑to‑run example that can be adapted for research or production pipelines involving graph neural networks.", "keywords": ["TensorFlow", "Deep Graph Infomax", "DGI", "graph neural network", "node classification", "citation networks", "DGL", "training script", "unsupervised learning", "graph embeddings"], "summary_hash": "1ccb2f506e25", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:11:51+00:00"}
