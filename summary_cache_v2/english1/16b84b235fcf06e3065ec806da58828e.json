{"summary": "This file defines the core neural components for a mixer‑based text‑to‑speech architecture, including mixin utilities, a block that fuses channel and temporal features, masked same‑length convolution and linear layers, a pre‑normalization residual wrapper, and a self‑attention module. These pieces are combined in a higher‑level module that orchestrates the flow of linguistic and acoustic representations through the mixer network.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and efficient combination of linguistic and acoustic features to improve the quality and modularity of speech synthesis systems, supporting both research experimentation and production‑grade TTS pipelines.", "keywords": ["text-to-speech", "feature mixing", "neural network", "self-attention", "masked convolution", "masked linear", "layer normalization", "residual connection", "same padding", "audio synthesis"], "summary_hash": "cc6cf1ee6d2c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:54:41+00:00"}
