{"summary": "Implements a training‑free, multistep UniPC scheduler for rapid diffusion model sampling. It configures and applies noise schedules, converts model predictions, scales inputs, and iteratively updates samples using configurable solvers, sigma strategies, and optional guidance, supporting various prediction types and thresholding schemes.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to accelerate diffusion‑based image and video generation by providing a flexible, high‑performance sampling component that reduces inference time while maintaining quality, and that can be integrated into existing pipelines without additional model training.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "UniPC", "multistep", "fast sampling", "beta schedule", "solver order", "prediction type", "thresholding", "sigma strategy", "Karras", "noise addition", "model output conversion", "guidance"], "summary_hash": "b762eda4deb3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:12:33+00:00"}
