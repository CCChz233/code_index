{"summary": "The class configures and runs an iterative numerical solution for MODFLOW‑6 models, handling a collection of flow or transport models of the same type. It encapsulates convergence tolerances, iteration limits, linear acceleration, under‑relaxation schemes, backtracking, preconditioner settings, matrix scaling/reordering, output options, pseudo‑transient continuation control, and adaptive‑time‑step interaction, while providing helpers to add, remove, and query the models in the solution.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, validated interface that lets modelers define and execute robust iterative solvers for groundwater simulations, offering preset and fine‑tuned settings to achieve convergence efficiently across simple to complex scenarios, while supporting diagnostics, reporting, and integration with adaptive time‑stepping workflows.", "keywords": ["iterative solver", "groundwater modeling", "MODFLOW 6", "convergence criteria", "nonlinear iterations", "linear iterations", "preconditioning", "under‑relaxation", "backtracking", "adaptive time stepping", "CSV output", "pseudo‑transient continuation", "model management"], "summary_hash": "721f2142e86b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:50:09+00:00"}
