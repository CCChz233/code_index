{"summary": "This module implements the ECRGate class, a two‑qubit ZX‑rotation (Echoed Cross‑Resonance) gate, and registers it as a standard gate within Qiskit’s circuit library. It provides the gate matrix, decomposition into native gates, and integration with the quantum circuit construction and transpilation workflow.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑use, hardware‑compatible two‑qubit gate that can be added to quantum circuits for algorithm development, simulation, and execution on quantum devices, simplifying the creation and manipulation of entangling operations.", "keywords": ["quantum", "gate", "two-qubit", "ZX rotation", "ECR", "Qiskit", "circuit library", "standard gate", "quantum computing", "entanglement"], "summary_hash": "e1e394fa7bed", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:12:04+00:00"}
