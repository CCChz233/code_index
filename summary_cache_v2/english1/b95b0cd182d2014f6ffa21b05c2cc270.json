{"summary": "Implements a recursive bottom‑up visitor for tree structures. Subclasses supply node‑specific methods that are invoked according to each node's data as the visitor walks from leaves to the root. Includes simple helper functions for standard and top‑down visits.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, customizable processing of hierarchical data (such as abstract syntax trees) by providing an efficient recursive traversal mechanism where users can inject custom behavior per node type, offering a performance edge over non‑recursive visitors.", "keywords": ["recursion", "visitor pattern", "bottom-up traversal", "tree processing", "callbacks", "inheritance", "performance", "abstract syntax tree", "hierarchical data"], "summary_hash": "83e3182618a3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:59:53+00:00"}
