{"summary": "The module provides a comprehensive test suite for the swap‑strategy routing passes used in Qiskit's transpiler. It validates that various swap strategies correctly map Pauli‑evolution and related circuits onto hardware, covering scenarios such as basic two‑qubit interactions, controlled operations, edge‑coloring routing, ancilla‑based enlargement, idle‑qubit handling, QAOA‑type ansätze, single‑qubit circuits, and device‑specific constraints. It also checks that appropriate exceptions are raised for invalid configurations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of quantum circuit transpilation when employing swap strategies, thereby ensuring that compiled circuits remain functionally equivalent and hardware‑compatible, which is essential for reliable execution of quantum algorithms.", "keywords": ["swap strategy", "quantum transpiler", "Qiskit", "unit testing", "Pauli evolution", "circuit routing", "edge coloring", "ancilla allocation", "idle qubits", "QAOA", "hardware constraints", "exception handling"], "summary_hash": "80ff3dbe955c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:45:25+00:00"}
