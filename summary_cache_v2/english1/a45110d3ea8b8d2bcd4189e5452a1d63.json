{"summary": "The module provides utilities to build a small graph and simple message/reduce functions, then defines unit tests that exercise edge-wise depth‑first propagation, node-wise breadth‑first propagation, and topological node propagation using the DGL backend. The tests verify that messages are correctly passed and aggregated according to the specified traversal strategies.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the graph propagation mechanisms in the compute layer operate correctly for different traversal orders, thereby validating the reliability of message‑passing operations in the system's graph processing components.", "keywords": ["graph propagation", "unit testing", "DGL", "message passing", "depth‑first search", "breadth‑first search", "topological order", "backend", "compute layer", "graph neural network"], "summary_hash": "4ec0975826ba", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:06:24+00:00"}
