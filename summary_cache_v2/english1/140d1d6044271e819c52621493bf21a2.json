{"summary": "The whitelist package implements an English text‑normalization pipeline based on finite‑state transducers. It provides tokenization and classification of sentences, applies predefined whitelist substitution rules to preserve or modify specific tokens, merges verbalizer grammars, and produces a final spoken‑form representation, exporting the models as OpenFst FAR files for integration into speech systems.", "business_intent": "To deliver a deterministic, high‑quality preprocessing layer for English speech applications, ensuring that special terms, abbreviations, and domain‑specific tokens are correctly handled during text‑to‑speech conversion, thereby improving pronunciation accuracy and overall user experience.", "keywords": ["text normalization", "whitelist", "finite-state transducer", "OpenFst", "tokenization", "classification", "verbalization", "English", "speech synthesis", "NLP"], "summary_hash": "7e30113b0a35", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:59:39+00:00"}
