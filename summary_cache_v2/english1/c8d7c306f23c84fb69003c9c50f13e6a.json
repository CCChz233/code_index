It communicates with the Prefect API to acquire and release concurrency slots, translates API responses into internal representations, and offers helper context managers to enforce these limits during async execution.", "business_intent": "Allow Prefect workflows to respect configured concurrency caps and rate‑limit policies, preventing resource over‑allocation and handling slot acquisition failures gracefully.", "keywords": ["asyncio", "concurrency control", "rate limiting", "Prefect API", "slot acquisition", "slot release", "exception handling", "minimal concurrency response", "async context manager"], "summary_hash": "a765667015cb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:27:47+00:00"}
