{"summary": "Defines a diffusion‑based pipeline that transforms textual prompts, optionally combined with reference images, into latent image embeddings compatible with the Kandinsky V2.2 model. It integrates a prior transformer, CLIP text and vision encoders, tokenization, and a scheduler to manage timesteps, handle default zero embeddings, perform interpolation, and prepare the resulting embeddings for downstream image synthesis.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and artists to generate high‑quality image embeddings from natural language descriptions (and optional visual cues) for use in Kandinsky V2.2 text‑to‑image or image‑guided generation workflows, streamlining content creation and AI‑driven visual design.", "keywords": ["diffusion pipeline", "Kandinsky V2.2", "prior transformer", "CLIP text encoder", "CLIP vision encoder", "latent embeddings", "text-to-image", "image-guided generation", "interpolation", "scheduler"], "summary_hash": "b252d6490a95", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:26:43+00:00"}
