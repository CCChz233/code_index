{"summary": "Represents a Keras model built as a directed graph of layers, using input and output tensors (which may be nested). It supports arbitrary architecture definitions, creation of sub‑models from intermediate tensors, and shared weights across related models.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible way for developers to construct, train, and reuse complex neural network architectures beyond simple sequential stacks, facilitating modular design and feature extraction.", "keywords": ["functional API", "directed graph", "layers", "inputs", "outputs", "tensors", "nested structures", "sub-model extraction", "weight sharing", "Keras", "model configuration", "loss handling", "shape inference"], "summary_hash": "083d5c80a9f7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:51:17+00:00"}
