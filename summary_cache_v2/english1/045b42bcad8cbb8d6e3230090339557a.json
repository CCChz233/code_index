{"summary": "Implements a multimodal diffusion pipeline that integrates CLIP image and text encoders, a VAE for latent image representation, a UNet‑style denoising model, and a scheduler to generate images, text, or aligned image‑text pairs from various conditioning inputs. Includes a data container for returning generated media and supports LoRA/PEFT weight scaling and optional output formats.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to create AI‑powered applications that produce coherent visual and textual content together, such as AI art generation with captions, automated illustration creation, or any workflow requiring synchronized image‑text synthesis.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "multimodal", "image generation", "text generation", "CLIP", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "LoRA", "PEFT", "pipeline", "AI art", "captioning", "stable diffusion"], "summary_hash": "7bb7e26003a5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:18:09+00:00"}
