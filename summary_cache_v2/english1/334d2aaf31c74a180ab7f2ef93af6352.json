{"summary": "This module implements preconditioned diffusion models used in the Imagen text‑to‑image architecture. It provides classes that wrap continuous denoising diffusion probabilistic models and elucidated diffusion models, handling loss calculation, forward generation, latent extraction, time‑step sampling, and random‑generator management to stabilize and accelerate training and inference.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the development and deployment of high‑quality text‑to‑image generative systems by offering robust, preconditioned diffusion mechanisms that improve model convergence, sampling efficiency, and overall image synthesis performance.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "preconditioning", "continuous DDPM", "EDM", "text-to-image", "generative model", "loss computation", "inference", "sampling", "random generator", "latent states"], "summary_hash": "26b66122ffe2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:06:47+00:00"}
