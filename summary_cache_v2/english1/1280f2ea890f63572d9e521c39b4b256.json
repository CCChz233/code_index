{"summary": "The module implements Prefect’s core orchestration engine, defining ordered policies and rules that are automatically applied to flow‑run and task‑run state transitions. It centralises logic for validating, modifying, or blocking transitions, handling caching of results, concurrency slot management, retry scheduling, pausing/resuming, duplicate‑transition prevention, and other safety checks to keep workflow execution consistent.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable server‑side mechanism that governs the lifecycle of workflows and tasks, ensuring that state changes respect business constraints such as result persistence, retry limits, concurrency limits, scheduling, and cancellation semantics, thereby preventing invalid runs and supporting robust, repeatable execution.", "keywords": ["orchestration", "state transition", "flow run", "task run", "policy", "rule", "caching", "concurrency", "retry", "pause", "cancellation", "scheduling", "Prefect"], "summary_hash": "960f92b0386e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:39:22+00:00"}
