{"summary": "This module implements the core logic for detecting and reporting class attribute violations in a flake8 plugin. It defines error messages, utilities for extracting node names and field identifiers, and rules for ignoring certain constructs such as special attributes, dataclasses, and TypedDicts. The functions provide getters for error configurations and determine when a class member should be skipped during analysis.", "business_intent": "Enforce coding standards and prevent the use of disallowed types or patterns in class attribute definitions by integrating with flake8's linting workflow.", "keywords": ["flake8", "plugin", "class attributes", "AST analysis", "linting", "error detection", "forbidden types", "dataclasses", "TypedDict", "code quality"], "summary_hash": "f048e207c80b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:05:41+00:00"}
