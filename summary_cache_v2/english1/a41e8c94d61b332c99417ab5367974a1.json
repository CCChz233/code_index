{"summary": "Provides a foundational implementation for applying rigid and affine transformations to 3‑dimensional data such as images, masks, bounding boxes, and keypoints. It manages per‑sample and per‑batch probabilities, optional uniform transformation across a batch, and optional dimension preservation, while also offering utilities to compute, apply, and invert transformation matrices.", "business_intent": "Enhance model training pipelines by automatically generating varied geometric versions of 3D inputs, thereby increasing data diversity, reducing overfitting, and improving model generalization for computer‑vision tasks.", "keywords": ["3D augmentation", "rigid transformation", "affine transformation", "probability control", "batch processing", "inverse transformation", "mask augmentation", "bounding box augmentation", "keypoint augmentation"], "summary_hash": "e10b6ec7909e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:51:51+00:00"}
