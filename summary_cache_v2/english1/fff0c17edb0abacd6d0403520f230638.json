{"summary": "This module contains unit tests that exercise a learning‑rate‑on‑plateau scheduler within training, validation, and testing workflows. It sets up synthetic data, runs engine loops, and checks that the learning rate is updated correctly according to the scheduler’s logic.", "business_intent": "Validate the correct integration and behavior of a learning‑rate scheduler in deep‑learning pipelines, ensuring that model training adapts its learning rate as expected for reliable performance in medical imaging applications.", "keywords": ["unit test", "learning rate scheduler", "plateau", "MONAI", "Ignite", "training loop", "validation", "testing", "PyTorch", "unittest", "LrScheduleHandler"], "summary_hash": "98e304eecbf6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:26:57+00:00"}
