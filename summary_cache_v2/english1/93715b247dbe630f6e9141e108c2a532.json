{"summary": "The module implements a PyTorch Dataset subclass that loads and serves samples from the ModelNet 3D shape point‑cloud dataset, handling file discovery, optional point‑cloud normalization, and providing length and item access methods. It also contains helper utilities for normalizing point clouds and a farthest point sampling routine (currently unused).", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to quickly integrate ModelNet point‑cloud data into training pipelines for 3D shape recognition, classification, and related computer‑vision or robotics applications.", "keywords": ["ModelNet", "point cloud", "PyTorch", "Dataset", "data loading", "normalization", "3D shape classification", "farthest point sampling"], "summary_hash": "90ffad9bc0c3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:25:55+00:00"}
