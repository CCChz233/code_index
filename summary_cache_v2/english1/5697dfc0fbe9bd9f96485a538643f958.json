{"summary": "The module implements a parser that reads graph‑based infrastructure check definitions, validates their structure, extracts solver specifications, and provides accessor methods to retrieve the parsed configuration. It also includes a utility to obtain the complex operator attribute from a check definition.", "business_intent": "Allow the security scanning engine to understand and evaluate custom graph checks by converting declarative check configurations into concrete solver objects that can be executed during infrastructure‑as‑code analysis.", "keywords": ["graph check parsing", "infrastructure security", "solver extraction", "configuration validation", "Checkov", "policy evaluation", "complex operator", "IaC analysis"], "summary_hash": "4913f61d20a7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T19:41:36+00:00"}
