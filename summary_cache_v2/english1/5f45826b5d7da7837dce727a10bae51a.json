{"summary": "This module implements a GPU‑accelerated Fourier transform interface that mirrors NumPy's fft API. It provides high‑level functions for one‑dimensional, two‑dimensional and N‑dimensional forward and inverse FFTs, real‑valued transforms, frequency‑bin generation, and shift operations, delegating the heavy lifting to the cuFFT library and handling data‑type conversion and plan management.", "business_intent": "To enable fast, scalable spectral analysis and signal‑processing workloads on CUDA‑enabled hardware, supporting scientific, engineering, and data‑analysis applications that require efficient Fourier transforms.", "keywords": ["FFT", "GPU", "CuPy", "cuFFT", "spectral analysis", "signal processing", "frequency domain", "high‑performance computing", "numpy compatibility"], "summary_hash": "6d9892d88c9b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:19:45+00:00"}
