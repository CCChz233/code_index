{"summary": "Encapsulates the core configuration of a groundwater flow model's basic package, managing cell boundary types, layer top and bottom elevations, initial hydraulic heads, and the head value for inactive cells. It derives the number of layers and layer thicknesses, validates the input arrays, and produces the formatted data required for model input files.", "business_intent": "Supply a standardized, validated representation of the fundamental hydrogeologic parameters needed by all groundwater flow simulations, enabling consistent setup of boundary conditions, geometry, and initial conditions across models.", "keywords": ["groundwater modeling", "basic package", "boundary conditions", "ibound", "layer geometry", "top elevation", "bottom elevation", "initial head", "inactive cell head", "layer thickness", "data validation", "model input generation"], "summary_hash": "d2c281b91b69", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:31:47+00:00"}
