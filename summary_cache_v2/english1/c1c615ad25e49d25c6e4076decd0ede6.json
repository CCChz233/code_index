{"summary": "Implements an algorithm that constructs an n‑qubit quantum circuit composed solely of CZ gates while respecting linear nearest‑neighbor connectivity. The method uses CX and phase (S, S†, Z) gates to achieve a two‑qubit depth bounded by 2·n + 2 and reverses the qubit ordering, following the approach described by Maslov and Roetteler.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient compilation of stabilizer‑type quantum programs for hardware with linear connectivity by providing a low‑depth, CZ‑only synthesis routine that reduces execution time and error rates on near‑term quantum devices.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit synthesis", "CZ gate", "linear nearest neighbor", "depth optimization", "stabilizer circuits", "Bruhat decomposition", "Qiskit", "quantum compilation", "CX gate", "phase gates", "qubit reversal"], "summary_hash": "2e32366691a5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:58:04+00:00"}
