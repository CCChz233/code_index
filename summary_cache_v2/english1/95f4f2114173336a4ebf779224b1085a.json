{"summary": "Integration test suite for DVC's plotting capabilities. It supplies pytest fixtures that create temporary repositories with diverse plot configurations, runs the DVC CLI to generate plot data, validates the structure of JSON outputs, checks handling of configuration options, nested plot definitions, empty or missing plot directories, and confirms that the generated Vega specifications match expected results. It also tests the repository plots API to ensure it returns correct plot data under default and custom configurations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee reliable and accurate plot generation and API responses in DVC, providing confidence to users that visualizations and related data are produced correctly across different configurations and repository states.", "keywords": ["DVC", "plotting", "integration testing", "pytest fixtures", "CLI", "JSON validation", "Vega specification", "configuration handling", "repository API", "plot data verification"], "summary_hash": "98d71ca3b161", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:32:44+00:00"}
