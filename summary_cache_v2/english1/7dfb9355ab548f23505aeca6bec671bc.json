{"summary": "The module offers a high‑level interface for running Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) evolution. It sets up a population of CGP individuals, applies a Mu+Lambda evolutionary strategy, and iterates until a stopping condition is met, returning the best evolved solution.", "business_intent": "Provide users with a simple, ready‑to‑use API to perform evolutionary optimization of CGP programs without dealing with low‑level algorithm details.", "keywords": ["Cartesian Genetic Programming", "CGP", "Mu+Lambda", "evolutionary algorithm", "population", "fitness evaluation", "optimization"], "summary_hash": "fcec11c6914f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:45:13+00:00"}
