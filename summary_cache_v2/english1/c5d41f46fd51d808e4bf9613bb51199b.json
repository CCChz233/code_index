{"summary": "The module provides a complete pipeline for training multi-token textual inversion embeddings with Stable Diffusion using the Flax/JAX framework. It defines a dataset class for loading images and prompts, prepares token embeddings, computes loss, runs distributed training steps, and handles model checkpointing and repository upload.", "business_intent": "Allow researchers and developers to create custom textual concepts that can be injected into diffusion models, enabling personalized image generation without retraining the entire model.", "keywords": ["textual inversion", "Stable Diffusion", "Flax", "JAX", "multi-token embeddings", "diffusion model training", "custom token", "dataset handling", "loss computation", "checkpointing", "Hugging Face"], "summary_hash": "f2e405b4487c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:06:04+00:00"}
