{"summary": "The module demonstrates how xarray's lazy evaluation works, showing that computations are deferred until results are required. It highlights benefits such as reduced memory usage and easy parallel execution using Dask, and provides example code to illustrate these concepts.", "business_intent": "Teach users how to leverage lazy evaluation for handling large datasets efficiently and accelerating calculations, enabling out‑of‑core processing and parallelism without manual data chunking.", "keywords": ["lazy evaluation", "xarray", "dask", "out-of-core", "parallel computing", "memory efficiency", "deferred execution", "large datasets", "example code", "user guide"], "summary_hash": "e3425419b43f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:02:40+00:00"}
