{"summary": "We have to infer class responsibility from method names and docstrings: all are \"Simple helper ...\" with various names: ansol, cisol, data, edread, enersol, esol, gapf, gssol, jsol, nsol, nstore, numvar, reset, rforce, rgb, solu, store, timerange, vardel, varnam. This seems like a utility class providing helper functions for solving equations, variable handling, storage, etc. Possibly part of a simulation or modeling framework. The class name Setup suggests it's used to set up simulation parameters, variables, and data. The methods are simple helpers for various tasks: ansol (maybe \"answer solution\"), cisol (maybe \"current solution\"?), data (data handling), edread (edit read), enersol (energy solution), esol (maybe \"equation solution\"), gapf (gap function), gssol (maybe \"global solution\"?), jsol (maybe \"Jacobian solution\"), nsol (maybe \"new solution\"), nstore (store number), numvar (number of variables), reset (reset state), rforce (reset force?), rgb (color), solu (solution), store (store data), timerange (time range), vardel (variable delete), varnam (variable name).
