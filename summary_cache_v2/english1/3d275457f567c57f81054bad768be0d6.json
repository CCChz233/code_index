{"summary": "The module implements an example workflow for adapting a pre‑trained text‑to‑image diffusion model to a new visual concept using the DreamBooth technique combined with Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It defines dataset utilities for loading and preprocessing instance and class images together with their prompts, handles model loading, tokenization, training loops, validation image generation, checkpointing, and optional publishing to a model hub.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use script that lets developers and creators quickly fine‑tune a diffusion model on a small set of custom images, enabling personalized image generation for branding, marketing, product visualization, or creative projects.", "keywords": ["DreamBooth", "LoRA", "Stable Diffusion", "fine‑tuning", "diffusion model", "custom concept generation", "image dataset", "tokenization", "model checkpointing", "Hugging Face hub"], "summary_hash": "aaa05d11a5b5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:04:56+00:00"}
