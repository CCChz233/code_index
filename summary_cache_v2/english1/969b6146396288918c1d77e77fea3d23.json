{"summary": "The module implements utilities for mixed‑precision training, including a buffer manager that stores and synchronizes full‑precision gradients across steps, and a wrapper that maintains master copies of model parameters and gradients in full precision while the model operates in half precision, handling copying, synchronization and optional asynchronous all‑reduce.", "business_intent": "Facilitate efficient and numerically stable training of large neural networks by leveraging mixed‑precision arithmetic, reducing memory usage and communication overhead while preserving convergence quality.", "keywords": ["mixed precision", "optimizer wrapper", "master parameters", "gradient buffer", "all-reduce", "gradient synchronization", "FP32 master copy", "FP16 model", "memory efficiency", "distributed training"], "summary_hash": "1aa4eed1c777", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:42:01+00:00"}
