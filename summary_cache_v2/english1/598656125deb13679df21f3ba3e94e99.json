{"summary": "EdgeCollator prepares minibatch inputs for edge‑level graph neural network training. Given a set of target edges, it samples the necessary neighborhoods, builds a subgraph containing those edges and their incident nodes, extracts the required input node IDs, and constructs the sequence of message‑flow blocks needed for forward propagation. It can also generate a separate graph of negative edges and supports exclusion of original or reverse edges to avoid information leakage, handling both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient and correct data loading for edge classification, regression, and link prediction models by automating the creation of computation‑ready subgraphs, input node tensors, and optional negative samples within each training minibatch.", "keywords": ["edge collator", "minibatch", "graph neural network", "neighbor sampling", "negative sampling", "subgraph extraction", "message flow graph", "heterogeneous graph", "reverse edge exclusion", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "219762023732", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:38:21+00:00"}
