{"summary": "The UnsaturatedZoneFlow class encapsulates the configuration and computation of unsaturated zone processes within a MODFLOW groundwater model. It stores cell‑level hydraulic and moisture properties, infiltration and evapotranspiration rates, and optional parameters for capillary‑pressure based ET, groundwater discharge, and budget reporting. Helper routines translate these inputs into the sparse structures required by MODFLOW, validate consistency, and render the package for simulation.", "business_intent": "Enable modelers to integrate detailed unsaturated zone flow and evapotranspiration processes into groundwater simulations, providing a flexible interface for specifying soil properties, surface fluxes, and budget outputs while ensuring input validation and compatibility with MODFLOW's UZF package.", "keywords": ["unsaturated zone", "groundwater modeling", "MODFLOW", "infiltration", "evapotranspiration", "hydraulic conductivity", "soil moisture", "budget output", "validation", "xarray", "data arrays", "simulation", "vertical connection", "land surface", "seepage"], "summary_hash": "a6b822f39d7c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:49:10+00:00"}
