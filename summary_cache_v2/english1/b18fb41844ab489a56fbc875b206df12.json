{"summary": "The script configures and launches a fine‑tuning job for an instruction‑guided Stable Diffusion model (Instruct‑Pix2Pix) using Megatron‑based latent diffusion editing. It parses Hydra configurations, builds a Megatron trainer, initializes the diffusion edit model, and runs the training loop while handling experiment management and logging.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run pipeline that lets developers or researchers adapt a pretrained Stable Diffusion model to specific instruction‑based image editing tasks, enabling customized text‑to‑image generation for commercial or research applications.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "instruct-pix2pix", "fine-tuning", "text-to-image", "image editing", "diffusion model", "megatron", "trainer", "hydra", "configuration", "experiment management"], "summary_hash": "c9c251c96bbf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:37:33+00:00"}
