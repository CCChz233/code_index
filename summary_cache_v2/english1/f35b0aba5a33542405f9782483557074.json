{"summary": "The module supplies a set of utilities for converting column values—such as categorical identifiers, integers, and floating‑point numbers—into compact integer codes and back again. It maintains bidirectional mappings for column identifiers, computes code ranges, and leverages sklearn transformers for scaling numeric data, enabling consistent tokenization of tabular features.", "business_intent": "To provide a reliable, high‑performance way to represent tabular column data as integer tokens that can be consumed by neural models or other downstream pipelines, improving storage efficiency and model compatibility.", "keywords": ["tokenization", "column encoding", "categorical code", "integer mapping", "float scaling", "bidirectional map", "sklearn preprocessing", "data preprocessing", "code generation", "feature representation"], "summary_hash": "745855891b7a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:52:01+00:00"}
