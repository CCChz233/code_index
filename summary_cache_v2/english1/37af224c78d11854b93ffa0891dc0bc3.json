{"summary": "A neural network module that performs learnable upsampling by first expanding channel dimensions with a convolution and then rearranging them with a pixel‑shuffle operation, supporting 1‑D, 2‑D and 3‑D data. The initial convolutional block can be customized, enabling flexible feature extraction before the sub‑pixel reconstruction.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient and artifact‑free super‑resolution or upsampling in computer‑vision and signal‑processing pipelines, reducing computational cost compared to transposed convolutions and improving quality for image, video, or volumetric data.", "keywords": ["subpixel convolution", "pixel shuffle", "upsampling", "super-resolution", "learnable upsampling", "CNN", "1D", "2D", "3D", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "da23bdcc28f1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:45:52+00:00"}
