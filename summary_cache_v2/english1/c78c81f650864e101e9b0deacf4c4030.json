{"summary": "The module implements a collection of parsing front‑end classes and helper utilities that bridge lexer components with various parsing algorithms (CYK, Earley, LALR). It manages configuration validation, lexer thread handling, optional data transformations, callback integration, and provides both standard and interactive parsing interfaces, as well as a regular‑expression matcher based on Earley parsing.", "business_intent": "Enable applications to parse input texts according to user‑defined grammars using multiple parsing strategies, while abstracting lexer setup, configuration checks, and interactive parsing features, thereby simplifying the integration of robust parsing capabilities into higher‑level software.", "keywords": ["parsing", "lexer", "CYK", "Earley", "LALR", "frontend", "grammar", "tokenization", "callback", "interactive parsing", "regular expression matcher"], "summary_hash": "c09580eaea71", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:41:47+00:00"}
