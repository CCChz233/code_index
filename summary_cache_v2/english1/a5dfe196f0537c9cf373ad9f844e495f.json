{"summary": "The module implements a neural network layer that performs semi‑supervised classification by modeling each class with a Gaussian mixture, fitting the mixtures from an initial label map and producing class probability maps for unlabeled voxels. It also provides a small utility to wrap arbitrary callables for forward and gradient propagation.", "business_intent": "To provide a probabilistic, mixture‑based classifier that can be integrated into MONAI pipelines for medical image analysis, enabling label propagation and uncertainty estimation in scenarios with limited annotated data.", "keywords": ["Gaussian mixture model", "semi-supervised classification", "probability estimation", "class membership", "PyTorch", "MONAI", "medical image denoising", "mixture fitting", "unlabeled data", "forward/backward utility"], "summary_hash": "9eca637b3980", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:29:52+00:00"}
