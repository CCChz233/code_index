{"summary": "The module implements a loss component for Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNNT) models used in automatic speech recognition. It validates inputs, selects among multiple RNNT loss back‑ends (standard PyTorch, multiblank, TDT, and optional warp‑RNNT/k2 implementations), computes the loss per time step, and applies optional reduction for training. Helper utilities clean and warn about extra arguments and resolve default loss identifiers.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate and flexible training of sequence‑to‑sequence speech recognition systems by providing a robust RNNT loss calculation that can adapt to different backend implementations and ensure correct input handling.", "keywords": ["RNNT", "loss function", "automatic speech recognition", "ASR", "PyTorch", "multiblank", "TDT", "warp‑transducer", "k2", "neural type validation", "reduction", "training"], "summary_hash": "fb5a4bb9c95c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:10:13+00:00"}
