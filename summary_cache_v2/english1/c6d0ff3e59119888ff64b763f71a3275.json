{"summary": "The module implements transforms for handling histology stains in digital pathology. It offers array‑level operations to deconvolve and standardize hematoxylin and eosin components with configurable intensity and concentration settings, and dictionary‑level wrappers that apply the same processing directly to key‑value data structures used in MONAI pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable stain separation and H&E normalization in preprocessing pipelines for whole‑slide image analysis, improving consistency and accuracy of downstream AI models in medical imaging.", "keywords": ["pathology", "stain deconvolution", "H&E normalization", "digital pathology", "array transforms", "dictionary wrappers", "whole-slide images", "preprocessing", "MONAI", "color normalization"], "summary_hash": "e660d00b19b0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:32:06+00:00"}
