{"summary": "Applies a transpose operation that swaps the rows and columns of an image, effectively rotating it 90 degrees followed by a horizontal flip. The transform also adjusts associated bounding boxes and keypoints to match the new dimensions, preserving channel order. It can be applied probabilistically based on a given probability parameter.", "business_intent": "Enables random image and annotation transposition as a data augmentation technique to increase dataset diversity and improve model robustness to orientation changes.", "keywords": ["transpose", "image augmentation", "diagonal flip", "bounding box adjustment", "keypoint swap", "probabilistic transform", "shape swap", "inverse operation"], "summary_hash": "a9c2910268c1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:25:44+00:00"}
