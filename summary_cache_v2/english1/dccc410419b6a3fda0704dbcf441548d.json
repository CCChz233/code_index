{"summary": "Provides a graph convolution module that implements Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation, using multiple parallel towers to perform message passing with configurable aggregators (e.g., mean, max, sum, statistical moments) and degree‑dependent scalers, then concatenates and linearly mixes the results, optionally adding a residual connection.", "business_intent": "Offer a flexible and expressive graph neural network layer that captures diverse neighborhood statistics and adapts to node degree variations, helping improve performance on graph‑based learning tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "principal neighbourhood aggregation", "convolution layer", "message passing", "aggregators", "scalers", "degree scaling", "statistical moments", "PyTorch", "DGL", "residual connection", "parallel towers"], "summary_hash": "15d82ab1fb2b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:44:50+00:00"}
