{"summary": "This module implements a comprehensive COPD disease model for a health simulation framework. It defines the disease entity, configures population parameters, and orchestrates a suite of events that simulate clinical encounters, disease progression, severe exacerbations, and mortality. The module also provides utilities for estimating baseline lung capacity, translating lung function into disability weights, and calculating probabilities for treatment benefits and disease advancement. Outcomes such as disability-adjusted life years are logged for analysis.", "business_intent": "Enable policymakers and researchers to evaluate the health and economic impact of COPD by simulating disease trajectories, treatment pathways, and associated outcomes across a virtual population.", "keywords": ["COPD", "disease progression", "lung function", "exacerbation", "treatment", "mortality", "disability-adjusted life years", "health simulation", "population modeling", "event-driven modeling", "linear predictive models"], "summary_hash": "238a07d42628", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:51:00+00:00"}
