{"summary": "A configuration container for the BLIP vision transformer model that holds architectural hyperparameters such as hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, image and patch sizes, activation functions, normalization epsilon, dropout rates, and weight initialization settings. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate a BLIP vision model with a defined architecture.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to customize, reproduce, and load BLIP vision models by specifying all relevant model architecture parameters in a single, serializable object, facilitating seamless integration with pretrained checkpoints and downstream vision-language applications.", "keywords": ["configuration", "vision transformer", "BLIP", "hidden size", "intermediate size", "layers", "attention heads", "image size", "patch size", "activation function", "layer normalization", "dropout", "initializer range", "pretrained", "model architecture"], "summary_hash": "2f4d7a3e03c5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:08:21+00:00"}
