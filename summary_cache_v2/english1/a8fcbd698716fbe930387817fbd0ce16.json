{"summary": "A collection of test support utilities that parse Python source files with the abstract syntax tree to enforce coding policies and measure test coverage for various components such as async HTTP handlers, router functions, and logging code. The tools scan directories, whitelist files, detect disallowed async calls, verify that cache invocations are asynchronous, and ensure functions stay within a maximum line count.", "business_intent": "Guarantee compliance with project standards for asynchronous client usage and maintain high test coverage by automatically detecting policy violations and untested functions, thereby improving code reliability and maintainability.", "keywords": ["AST", "code coverage", "async HTTP handler", "router", "logging", "line length enforcement", "test utilities", "policy compliance", "function analysis"], "summary_hash": "2e7d12198091", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:02:48+00:00"}
