{"summary": "Implements a synthesis plugin that converts permutation gates into circuits composed solely of SWAP gates using the token‑swapper algorithm. It can operate with or without connectivity constraints, returning a valid circuit when possible or None otherwise, and offers configurable trial count, random seed, and parallel processing threshold.", "business_intent": "Enables automatic, hardware‑aware translation of permutation operations into efficient SWAP‑gate sequences for quantum compilation and optimization, simplifying layout and routing steps.", "keywords": ["token swapper", "permutation synthesis", "SWAP gates", "quantum circuit", "coupling map", "trials", "seed", "parallel processing", "quantum compilation", "permutation gate"], "summary_hash": "4c8b9bda823e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:45:35+00:00"}
