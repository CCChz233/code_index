{"summary": "This module contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests that validate the behavior of Lightning's model summary utility across a wide range of neural network configurations, including empty, nested, lazy‑initialized, mixed‑dtype, scripted, and unordered models. The tests check parameter counting, size estimation, shape reporting, handling of non‑layer parameters, depth limits, training/evaluation mode restoration, and proper hook cleanup.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the model summary feature reliably reports model architecture details and resource usage, supporting diverse model designs and edge cases, thereby helping developers diagnose model complexity and memory requirements in production and research workflows.", "keywords": ["model summary", "unit tests", "PyTorch Lightning", "parameter count", "model size", "shape reporting", "mixed dtype", "lazy initialization", "nested modules", "scripted modules", "training mode", "hook cleanup", "depth limit"], "summary_hash": "f3e87fbf5c71", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:35:51+00:00"}
