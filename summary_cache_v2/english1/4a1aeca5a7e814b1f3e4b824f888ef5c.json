{"summary": "Implements a Python interpreter that walks the bytecode produced by the Rust OpenQASM 2.0 parser, translating it into Qiskit circuit objects. It manages custom and user‑defined quantum instructions, gate construction, delays, barriers, measurements and other classical/quantum operations, handling metadata such as parameter counts and qubit mappings.", "business_intent": "Enable Qiskit to load and execute OpenQASM 2.0 programs by converting the low‑level parsed representation into high‑level circuit structures, supporting extensibility through custom gates and legacy instruction sets.", "keywords": ["OpenQASM", "bytecode interpreter", "Qiskit", "quantum circuit", "custom gate", "gate definition", "parser", "quantum computing", "circuit construction", "Rust parser"], "summary_hash": "080879a69ee2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:57:19+00:00"}
