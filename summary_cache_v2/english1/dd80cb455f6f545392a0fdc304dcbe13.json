{"summary": "A collection of command‑line tools and helper utilities for creating, training, merging, and evaluating KenLM n‑gram language models that are integrated with NeMo automatic speech recognition pipelines. It handles text preprocessing (including BPE and phoneme tokenization), builds phone‑level LMs, performs weighted interpolation of ARPA models, and runs beam‑search decoding with configurable language‑model weights to compute transcription metrics.", "business_intent": "Empower speech‑technology teams to enhance ASR accuracy by easily incorporating external n‑gram language models into their workflows, from data preparation and model training to evaluation and deployment, thereby reducing error rates and accelerating development of robust speech recognition products.", "keywords": ["n-gram language model", "KenLM", "automatic speech recognition", "NeMo", "beam search decoding", "tokenization", "BPE", "phoneme LM", "model interpolation", "perplexity", "WER evaluation", "command-line utility"], "summary_hash": "85b9f37125e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:15:50+00:00"}
