{"summary": "The module defines a configurable recurrent neural network encoder used in automatic speech recognition pipelines. It supports various RNN cell types, optional bidirectional processing, per‑layer projection, and integrates different subsampling strategies (convolutional and stacking) to produce compact, streaming‑compatible acoustic feature representations.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and efficient speech‑to‑text models that can be tailored for high‑accuracy or low‑latency streaming applications, reducing computational load while maintaining recognition performance.", "keywords": ["RNN encoder", "automatic speech recognition", "subsampling", "bidirectional", "projection", "streaming", "configurable", "acoustic features", "PyTorch", "neural network"], "summary_hash": "f3df8dd68cb6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:07:58+00:00"}
