{"summary": "Provides a foundational implementation for information retrieval models, handling configuration‑driven data loading, forward computation, loss calculation, and evaluation metrics such as mean reciprocal rank. It also supplies utilities for accessing language‑model embeddings, enumerating supported model variants, and orchestrating training, validation, and testing steps.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to quickly build and experiment with IR systems by offering a ready‑made scaffold that manages dataset preparation, model execution, performance tracking, and integration with language model embeddings.", "keywords": ["information retrieval", "model base class", "data loading", "training loop", "validation", "scoring", "loss computation", "mean reciprocal rank", "language model embedding", "model registry"], "summary_hash": "d68144a37a9f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:10:28+00:00"}
