{"summary": "The module defines data structures and utilities for handling fidelity bonds, including converting bond data to and from a compact binary format, creating cryptographic proof messages, and verifying those proofs using ECDSA signatures. It also provides helper routines for encoding/decoding messages and performing sanity checks on bond contents.", "business_intent": "To enable secure, verifiable commitments between participants by issuing and validating cryptographically signed fidelity bonds, thereby protecting against fraud and ensuring trust in peer‑to‑peer financial exchanges.", "keywords": ["fidelity bond", "serialization", "deserialization", "cryptographic proof", "ECDSA signature", "verification", "base64", "JSON", "binary encoding", "integrity", "authenticity"], "summary_hash": "7f46043e5534", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:19:14+00:00"}
