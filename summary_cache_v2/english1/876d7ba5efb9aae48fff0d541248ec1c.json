{"summary": "The module defines a LayoutModel class that serves as a wrapper around a layout prediction engine. It loads the underlying model, runs inference on document pages to generate structural predictions (such as bounding boxes, cells, and clusters), converts these predictions into the library's layout data structures, and applies a lightweight post‑processing step to refine the results.", "business_intent": "Provide an automated way to analyze and extract the visual layout of documents, facilitating downstream tasks like OCR, data extraction, indexing, and document conversion.", "keywords": ["layout prediction", "document segmentation", "bounding boxes", "post‑processing", "model inference", "page analysis", "structured layout", "automated document processing"], "summary_hash": "92c1c6c43445", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:38:41+00:00"}
