{"summary": "An example script that demonstrates how to evaluate a Megatron Vision Transformer (ViT) classification model using NVIDIA NeMo. It configures the data pipeline, loads a pretrained checkpoint, sets up a PyTorch Lightning Trainer with appropriate distributed strategies, runs inference on a validation or test dataset, and logs evaluation metrics.", "business_intent": "Provide users with a ready‑to‑run reference for assessing the performance of Megatron‑based ViT classification models, enabling quick benchmarking and validation of pretrained checkpoints in production or research workflows.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "Vision Transformer", "ViT", "classification", "evaluation", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "distributed training", "checkpoint", "data loader", "image dataset", "metrics", "inference"], "summary_hash": "c70fe2ff1f39", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:41:12+00:00"}
