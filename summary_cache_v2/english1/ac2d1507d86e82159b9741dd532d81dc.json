{"summary": "The module implements the core framework for defining and running workflow specifications. It provides a base class that manages step definitions, input handling, parameter parsing, constant values, data persistence, validation of step transitions, iteration constructs such as foreach, command execution, artifact merging, and navigation between steps. A metaclass configures and registers flow classes, while supporting utilities handle parallel iteration placeholders and specific error conditions.", "business_intent": "To give data scientists and engineers a robust, declarative way to build, execute, and scale data pipelines, ensuring correct step sequencing, parameter management, and parallel processing while abstracting storage and execution details.", "keywords": ["workflow", "pipeline", "step definition", "parameter handling", "input management", "data persistence", "foreach", "parallel execution", "artifact merging", "metaclass", "exception handling", "Metaflow"], "summary_hash": "9e262d676a74", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:55:53+00:00"}
