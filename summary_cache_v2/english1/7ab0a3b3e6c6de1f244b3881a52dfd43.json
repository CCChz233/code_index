{"summary": "The module defines a class that encapsulates the definition and handling of one or multiple pumping or injection wells for a groundwater simulation. It stores identifiers, coordinates, flow rates, optional layer information, and temporal schedules, and provides utilities to assemble well input data, repeat it across stress periods, render it into model packages, and optionally capture budget output.", "business_intent": "Enable modelers to conveniently specify, schedule, and integrate well operations into groundwater flow models, streamlining the creation of well input files and supporting budget tracking for simulation analysis.", "keywords": ["well", "groundwater modeling", "pumping", "injection", "stress period scheduling", "input generation", "budget tracking", "spatial coordinates", "flow rate", "layer assignment"], "summary_hash": "6758df7787f0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:46:13+00:00"}
