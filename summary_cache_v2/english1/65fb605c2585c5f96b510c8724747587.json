{"summary": "Implements a DGL‑based message passing network that runs loopy belief propagation on molecular graphs. It extracts atom and bond attributes from RDKit molecules, builds DGL graphs, and provides a compact class with forward and run methods to compute node embeddings through iterative update steps.", "business_intent": "Facilitates learning and inference on chemical structures for applications such as property prediction, molecular generation, and drug discovery.", "keywords": ["molecular graph", "message passing", "belief propagation", "DGL", "PyTorch", "atom features", "bond features", "graph neural network", "chemistry", "drug discovery"], "summary_hash": "8f483e8b0fff", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:32:34+00:00"}
