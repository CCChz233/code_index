{"summary": "A unit‑test suite that validates the cooldown logic used by the Litellm router. It checks how deployment failures trigger cooldown periods, how the router decides whether to apply cooldown, and that Prometheus metrics are correctly recorded (or safely ignored) during these events. The tests also verify helper functions for translating exception status codes and for incrementing success counters without persisting to Redis.", "business_intent": "Guarantee stable routing of language model requests by confirming that failing deployments are temporarily paused, preventing overload and improving overall service reliability, while providing observability through metrics.", "keywords": ["litellm", "router", "cooldown", "deployment", "prometheus", "metrics", "unit testing", "exception handling", "rate limit", "authentication error", "async", "mock"], "summary_hash": "488d5583414e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:17:09+00:00"}
