{"summary": "This module implements a multi‑GPU benchmark for training Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) on heterogeneous graph data. It defines a classification head for entity prediction, a neighbor‑sampling utility for constructing mini‑batches, and supporting configuration and utility functions. The benchmark runs distributed training across multiple GPUs, applying L2 normalization to model weights and pruning irrelevant nodes to measure scalability and performance of the RGCN implementation using DGL.", "business_intent": "Provide a reference performance test that helps engineers and researchers evaluate and optimize the efficiency, scalability, and resource utilization of distributed multi‑GPU training pipelines for relational graph neural networks.", "keywords": ["relational graph convolutional network", "RGCN", "multi-GPU", "distributed training", "DGL", "neighbor sampling", "entity classification", "benchmark", "graph neural network", "performance evaluation", "L2 regularization"], "summary_hash": "b6281e99f055", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:04:08+00:00"}
