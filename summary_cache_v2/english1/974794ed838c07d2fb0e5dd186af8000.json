{"summary": "The module implements a discrete Euler scheduler for diffusion models, offering configurable noise‑sigma generation (linear, Karras, exponential, beta), timestep scaling, input scaling, interpolation methods, prediction types, step offsets, and beta rescaling to guide the denoising trajectory during sampling. It also defines a lightweight container for the scheduler’s step output.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and efficient sampling in diffusion‑based generative AI pipelines by providing a customizable scheduler that adapts the denoising process to various generation tasks and performance requirements.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "Euler", "discrete", "noise schedule", "sigma generation", "Karras", "beta rescaling", "interpolation", "prediction mode", "step offset", "PyTorch", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "2651a44e056c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:14:29+00:00"}
