{"summary": "The module implements a suite of utilities for creating, storing, and accessing large, pre‑indexed text corpora used in language‑model training. It provides read‑only memory‑mapped datasets, builders that incrementally construct the indexed files, and cached/prefetching wrappers to accelerate random item retrieval while keeping memory usage low.", "business_intent": "To enable scalable, high‑performance data pipelines for training massive language models by offering fast, low‑memory random access to tokenized text data, reducing I/O bottlenecks and supporting efficient prefetching and caching strategies.", "keywords": ["indexed dataset", "memory‑mapped", "caching", "prefetch", "language modeling", "Megatron", "token counting", "random access", "dataset builder", "document boundaries", "large‑scale NLP"], "summary_hash": "182ae1f4750a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:29:39+00:00"}
