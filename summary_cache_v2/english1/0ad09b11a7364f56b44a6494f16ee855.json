{"summary": "Implements a multi-head scaled dot-product attention layer that projects inputs into query, key, and value tensors, splits them across several attention heads, computes scaled dot-product attention with optional dropout on scores and output, and then merges the heads back into a single representation.", "business_intent": "Provides the core attention computation for transformer‑based models used in natural language processing, speech, and other sequence modeling applications, enabling parallel attention across multiple representation subspaces to improve contextual encoding.", "keywords": ["multi-head attention", "scaled dot-product", "dropout", "transformer", "embeddings", "attention heads", "layer normalization", "sequence modeling"], "summary_hash": "e9d12c9b99a2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:38:05+00:00"}
