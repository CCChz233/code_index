{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests that verify the functionality of the LiteLLM caching handler. The tests cover asynchronous logging of cache hits, setting and retrieving cache entries, merging cached embedding responses with new API results, and converting cached data into standard model response formats. The goal is to ensure that the caching layer correctly stores, retrieves, and integrates cached information for various LLM operations.", "business_intent": "Validate and guarantee the correctness of the caching infrastructure for language model interactions, thereby enhancing performance, reducing redundant API calls, and lowering operational costs.", "keywords": ["caching", "LLM", "async", "embedding", "rerank", "unit test", "litellm", "cache hit", "cache miss", "model response", "performance"], "summary_hash": "111d3bc0da78", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:27:45+00:00"}
