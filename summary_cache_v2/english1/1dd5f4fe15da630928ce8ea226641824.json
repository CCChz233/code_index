{"summary": "The module provides a comprehensive test suite for the apogee prediction component, exercising its initialization, start/stop lifecycle, queue timeout handling, convergence behavior, prediction loop timing, and verification of class slot usage. It also includes a lightweight threaded helper to run the predictor in a separate thread during tests.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correctness and performance of the apogee prediction logic used in telemetry processing, preventing regressions and ensuring reliable operation in flight data analysis.", "keywords": ["apogee prediction", "unit testing", "telemetry", "initialization", "start/stop", "queue timeout", "convergence", "timing", "class slots", "threading", "multiprocessing", "lookup table", "processor data packet"], "summary_hash": "3d4f8621f377", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:29:04+00:00"}
