{"summary": "The module defines a BERT‑based embedding pipeline for information‑retrieval applications. It wraps a Megatron‑BERT encoder, adds a head that aggregates token embeddings via mean pooling, and provides a lightweight model class with a simple inference method that returns fixed‑size dense vectors for input text.", "business_intent": "Enable generation of high‑quality dense text embeddings that can be used for similarity search, ranking, or other retrieval‑oriented downstream tasks within NeMo‑based NLP solutions.", "keywords": ["BERT", "dense embedding", "mean pooling", "information retrieval", "NeMo", "PyTorch", "inference API", "text representation", "Megatron", "language model"], "summary_hash": "e269578fc85f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:36:49+00:00"}
