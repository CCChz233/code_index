{"summary": "The module provides a suite of lightweight adapter components tailored for Megatron‑style transformer models. It defines standardized adapter identifiers, implements parallel‑compatible linear adapters, and offers a variety of LoRA‑based low‑rank adapters for attention, feed‑forward, key‑query‑value projections, and multimodal projection layers. It also includes utilities for weight tying across related adapters and a helper for reshaping tensor‑parallel data layouts. The adapters enable modular, parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning and extension of large models while respecting ...", "business_intent": "Enable ...", "keywords": ["adapter", "LoRA", "low‑rank adaptation", "tensor parallel", "Megatron", "fine‑tuning", "weight tying", "multimodal projector", "prompt encoder", "parallel linear", "all‑to‑all"], "summary_hash": "00a98692a6bc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:08:39+00:00"}
