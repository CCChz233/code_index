{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe must not list method names verbatim. So we need to describe class responsibility and behavior.\n\nClass: MarigoldNormalsPipeline. It is a pipeline for monocular normals estimation using Marigold method. It uses diffusion models (UNet, VAE, scheduler) and CLIP text encoder/tokenizer for empty text embedding. It can predict surface normals from a single image, optionally using full Z range. It handles default denoising steps and processing resolution. It provides methods for input validation, latent preparation, decoding predictions, ensembling, normalizing, progress bar, retrieving latents.\n\nSo summary: A diffusion-based pipeline that takes a single RGB image and outputs per-pixel surface normal vectors, using the Marigold approach. It orchestrates model components (conditional UNet, VAE, scheduler, CLIP text encoder) to encode the image, run diffusion denoising, decode latent to normals, optionally ensemble multiple predictions, and normalize vectors.\n\nBusiness intent: Provide developers and researchers with an easy-to-use tool for estimating 3D surface orientation from monocular images, enabling applications such as AR, robotics, scene understanding, and content creation without requiring depth sensors.\n\nKeywords: monocular normal estimation, diffusion pipeline, surface normals, Marigold, UNet, VAE, scheduler, CLIP, image-to-normal, 3D reconstruction, computer vision.\n\nMake sure not to list method names verbatim.
