{"summary": "The module contains unit tests that exercise the Prefect runner's FastAPI web server, verifying that deployment‑related and flow‑related API routes function correctly. Tests cover feature‑flag gating, input validation, execution of simple and complex flows, handling of arguments, and confirmation that expected endpoints exist. Additional tests ensure server configuration settings are applied properly. Helper functions provide sample flows and deployment objects used by the tests.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and reliability of the Prefect runner's web API for managing flows and deployments, ensuring experimental features, input validation, execution behavior, and configuration settings work as intended before release.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "runner", "web server", "API testing", "deployment routes", "flow routes", "feature flags", "validation", "FastAPI", "unit tests", "settings"], "summary_hash": "fac6d9e7f911", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:11:51+00:00"}
