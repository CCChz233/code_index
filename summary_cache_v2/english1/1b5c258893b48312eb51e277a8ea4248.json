It includes a stub for application configuration, a mutable container for individual model definitions, a comprehensive project state holder, and a mutable apps registry that can add, remove, clone, and render models. These components work together to capture, modify, and reconstruct the full set of models and apps as they evolve across migration steps.", "business_intent": "To provide Django's migration framework with a reliable, mutable representation of the project's schema, enabling safe creation, alteration, and rendering of model classes during database schema migrations and allowing the system to track and apply structural changes across versions.", "keywords": ["Django", "migration", "state management", "model definition", "app registry", "project state", "schema evolution", "mutable representation", "model rendering", "database migration"], "summary_hash": "0298b588108a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:25:53+00:00"}
