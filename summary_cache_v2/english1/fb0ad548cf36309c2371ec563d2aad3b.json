{"summary": "Generates and applies an equi‑spaced under‑sampling mask to MRI k‑space data, preserving a configurable proportion of central low‑frequency columns and selecting the remaining columns at regular intervals to achieve a desired acceleration factor. When multiple center‑fraction and acceleration pairs are supplied, one pair is randomly chosen each time the object is invoked.", "business_intent": "Facilitate accelerated MRI acquisition simulation and reconstruction by reducing k‑space data volume while retaining essential low‑frequency information for image quality.", "keywords": ["k-space", "mask", "equi-spaced", "under-sampling", "acceleration", "low-frequency", "MRI", "random selection", "data reduction"], "summary_hash": "483c936d6595", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:19:20+00:00"}
