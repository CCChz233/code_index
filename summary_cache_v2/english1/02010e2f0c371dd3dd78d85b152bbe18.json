{"summary": "The module implements core secp256k1 cryptographic utilities for Bitcoin, including private/public key handling, ECDSA signing and verification, ECDH key agreement, and Base58Check encoding/decoding of keys and addresses. It also provides a wrapper class for private keys that exposes related operations such as compression checks and signature generation.", "business_intent": "Enable Bitcoin applications to securely generate, manipulate, and use elliptic curve keys for transaction signing, address creation, and secure communication, by offering a Python interface to low‑level secp256k1 functions.", "keywords": ["secp256k1", "ECDSA", "ECDH", "private key", "public key", "Bitcoin", "Base58Check", "address encoding", "signature", "cryptography", "key management"], "summary_hash": "8e33c0ea5fec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:17:23+00:00"}
