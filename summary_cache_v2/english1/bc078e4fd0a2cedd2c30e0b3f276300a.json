{"summary": "This module implements a Vulkan SPIR-V code generator that traverses high‑level shader abstract syntax trees and emits SPIR-V modules. It handles declaration of constants, types, globals, and functions, and translates statements such as assignments, control flow, and expressions while managing unique IDs and type mappings.", "business_intent": "Enable automatic conversion of high‑level shader code into Vulkan‑compatible SPIR-V binaries, serving as a backend for shader translation tools and facilitating integration of custom shaders into Vulkan graphics pipelines.", "keywords": ["Vulkan", "SPIR-V", "code generation", "shader translation", "AST", "shader compiler", "graphics", "GPU", "module generation", "type mapping", "control flow"], "summary_hash": "c8c711f4819e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:37:26+00:00"}
