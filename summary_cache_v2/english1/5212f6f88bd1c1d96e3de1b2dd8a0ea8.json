{"summary": "This module implements a collection of utilities for handling MONAI model bundles, including downloading bundles from various sources (GitHub, NGC, MONAI hosting), extracting and verifying bundle metadata, converting models to deployment formats (ONNX, TorchScript, TensorRT), exporting checkpoints, and orchestrating bundle workflows. It also provides helper functions for version management, logging, and interaction with external repositories such as Hugging Face.", "business_intent": "Enable users to efficiently acquire, validate, and prepare medical imaging AI models packaged as MONAI bundles for production deployment, supporting multiple distribution channels and conversion to runtime‑optimized formats.", "keywords": ["MONAI", "model bundle", "download", "metadata", "versioning", "ONNX", "TorchScript", "TensorRT", "NGC", "GitHub", "Hugging Face", "workflow", "inference", "model conversion"], "summary_hash": "aafdda2b5fb2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:08:05+00:00"}
