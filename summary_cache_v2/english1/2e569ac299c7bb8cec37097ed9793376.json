{"summary": "A unit‑test module that validates the MONAI KSpaceSpikeNoise transform. It creates synthetic 2D and 3D images, injects spike noise into their Fourier domain, and checks that the noisy pixels are correctly identified and that repeated applications yield identical results across different array backends.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and reproducibility of k‑space spike noise augmentation used in medical imaging pipelines, supporting consistent model training and evaluation.", "keywords": ["k-space", "spike noise", "MONAI", "synthetic image", "unit test", "reproducibility", "FFT", "parameterized", "numpy", "torch"], "summary_hash": "d6c09d2fb7b6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:25:15+00:00"}
