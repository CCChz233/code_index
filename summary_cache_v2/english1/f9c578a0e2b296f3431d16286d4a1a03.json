{"summary": "The module defines the internal data structures and mechanisms for handling calibration entries used in Qiskit Pulse. It provides abstract and concrete representations for calibration objects, supports publishing and provenance tracking of calibration data, and enables parameter substitution to generate concrete pulse schedules from stored definitions.", "business_intent": "Facilitate reliable storage, management, and application of hardware calibration information for pulse-level quantum control, ensuring that calibrated schedules can be generated and traced back to their source definitions.", "keywords": ["calibration", "pulse", "schedule", "parameter substitution", "Qobj conversion", "provenance", "publishing", "quantum hardware", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "c96617299763", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:50:31+00:00"}
