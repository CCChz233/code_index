{"summary": "The module defines a custom Stable Diffusion pipeline that parses prompts containing attention weight annotations, computes corresponding weighted text embeddings, and integrates them into the diffusion process. It includes utilities for handling prompt parsing, embedding generation, token padding, and preprocessing of input images and masks, extending the standard Stable Diffusion workflow to support fine‑grained prompt weighting.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and creative users of Stable Diffusion to exert precise control over image generation by applying per‑token attention weights in prompts, enhancing the quality and specificity of AI‑generated artwork.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "prompt weighting", "attention weights", "text embeddings", "diffusion pipeline", "image generation", "AI art", "deep learning", "prompt parsing", "weighted prompts"], "summary_hash": "ab20cc516c07", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:01:32+00:00"}
