{"summary": "The module defines a Genome class that represents the genotype of an individual in Cartesian Genetic Programming. It organizes the DNA into input, hidden, and output sections, provides methods for accessing and iterating over these regions, validates structural constraints, supports cloning and mutation operations, and implements comparison logic for evolutionary selection.", "business_intent": "Enable automated design and optimization of computational structures (e.g., circuits, programs, neural networks) through evolutionary search by managing the genetic representation and its manipulation within a CGP framework.", "keywords": ["Cartesian Genetic Programming", "genome", "genetic encoding", "mutation", "evolutionary algorithm", "genotype", "graph representation", "primitives", "node", "operator node"], "summary_hash": "a1d60e130989", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:45:35+00:00"}
