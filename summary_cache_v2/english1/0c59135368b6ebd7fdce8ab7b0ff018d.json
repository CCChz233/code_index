{"summary": "The module defines a collection of neural network building blocks—including down‑sampling, up‑sampling, feature extraction, and residual modules—tailored for the LocalNet architecture used in weakly‑supervised multimodal medical image registration. These components encapsulate convolutional, normalization, pooling, and deconvolution operations to streamline model construction within the MONAI framework.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to rapidly assemble and customize LocalNet‑based registration networks for medical imaging applications, improving accuracy and efficiency of weakly‑supervised multimodal image alignment.", "keywords": ["LocalNet", "downsampling", "upsampling", "residual block", "feature extraction", "convolutional neural network", "medical image registration", "multimodal registration", "weakly supervised learning", "MONAI", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "31fcb77900ca", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:20:44+00:00"}
