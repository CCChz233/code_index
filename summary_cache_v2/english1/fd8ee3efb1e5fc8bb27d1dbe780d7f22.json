{"summary": "Implements a loss function that combines categorical cross‑entropy with an alpha‑balanced focal modulation, allowing multi‑class models to down‑weight easy examples and compensate for class imbalance, with optional logits handling, label smoothing, axis selection and reduction strategies.", "business_intent": "Enable training of neural networks on imbalanced multi‑class datasets by providing a configurable loss that emphasizes hard-to‑classify samples and applies class‑specific weighting, improving model performance without manual class‑weight tuning.", "keywords": ["focal loss", "categorical crossentropy", "class imbalance", "alpha weighting", "gamma focusing", "deep learning", "loss function", "multi-class classification", "label smoothing", "reduction", "logits"], "summary_hash": "4d69889d1f44", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:49:49+00:00"}
