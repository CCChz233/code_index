{"summary": "Implements a pipeline that enables text‑guided image editing and inpainting by combining Stable Diffusion with the DiffEdit technique. The workflow encodes input images into latent space, optionally inverts them, creates edit masks from textual prompts, runs a conditional UNet denoiser using forward and inverse schedulers, decodes the edited latents back to pixel space, and applies a safety filter. It also supports loading textual inversion embeddings and LoRA weight files.", "business_intent": "Provides a ready‑to‑use solution for creators, designers, and marketers to modify or enhance images through natural language instructions, accelerating content production, enabling rapid visual iteration, and ensuring generated images comply with safety standards.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "diffedit", "text‑guided image editing", "inpainting", "latent diffusion", "UNet denoiser", "scheduler", "safety filter", "textual inversion", "LoRA", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "7cacf0aa726b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:40:24+00:00"}
