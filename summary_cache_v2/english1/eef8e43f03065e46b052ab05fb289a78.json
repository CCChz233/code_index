{"summary": "Test module that validates the AudioLDM2 diffusion-based audio generation pipeline. It defines fast unit tests for core functionality, edge‑case handling, component wiring, input preparation, sampling strategies, prompt and embedding processing, output format, batch inference, model serialization, device offloading, datatype conversion, and optional acceleration kernels. It also includes slower integration tests covering standard, large, language‑model‑guided, and text‑to‑speech configurations.", "business_intent": "Provide comprehensive verification of the AudioLDM2 pipeline to guarantee reliable text‑to‑audio and speech synthesis performance, enabling safe deployment in products and services that rely on high‑quality audio generation.", "keywords": ["AudioLDM2", "audio generation", "pipeline testing", "unit tests", "integration tests", "diffusion model", "text-to-audio", "speech synthesis", "model serialization", "device offloading", "batch inference"], "summary_hash": "d4961c9846cb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:52:58+00:00"}
