{"summary": "The module provides the essential components for constructing Vision Transformer (ViT) models, including a patch‑dropping augmentation, a backbone that processes image tensors, interpolates positional embeddings, and produces visual feature maps, and a pooling head that extracts and projects token representations. It integrates with Megatron parallelism and NeMo utilities for scalable training.", "business_intent": "To deliver modular, high‑performance Vision Transformer building blocks within the NeMo framework, enabling developers to efficiently train and fine‑tune large‑scale computer‑vision models for tasks such as image classification and feature extraction.", "keywords": ["vision transformer", "ViT backbone", "positional embedding interpolation", "patch dropout augmentation", "MLP pooling head", "feature extraction", "image classification", "Megatron parallelism", "NeMo", "torch"], "summary_hash": "7d1417a77aa4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:19:03+00:00"}
