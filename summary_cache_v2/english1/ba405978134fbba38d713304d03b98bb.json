{"summary": "A collection of utilities for tracking resource usage during machine‑learning benchmark runs. It provides structures and calculators for energy consumption, latency (including per‑token timing and throughput), and memory usage across CPU and GPU, handling measurement lifecycles, aggregation, unit conversion, and optional integration with external power‑measurement tools.", "business_intent": "To give developers and researchers precise visibility into the power, speed, and memory characteristics of their models, enabling performance optimization, cost estimation, and hardware‑efficiency decisions for production or research workloads.", "keywords": ["energy consumption", "latency measurement", "throughput", "memory usage", "benchmarking", "ML performance", "resource monitoring", "CPU", "GPU", "power measurement", "per-token timing"], "summary_hash": "fc072c05b717", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:32:23+00:00"}
