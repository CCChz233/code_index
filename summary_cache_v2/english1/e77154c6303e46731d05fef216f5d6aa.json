{"summary": "This module implements a recurrent computation block for transformer‑based language models. It encapsulates state management, allocates a cache for inference, and provides a forward operation that processes input sequences while preserving internal hidden states across steps.", "business_intent": "To enable efficient, stateful inference in large language models by reusing previously computed activations, thereby reducing latency and computational cost during generation or streaming tasks.", "keywords": ["recurrent", "stateful", "cache", "inference", "transformer", "language model", "Megatron", "sequence processing", "neural network block", "forward pass"], "summary_hash": "d5808f18cfa2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:38:25+00:00"}
