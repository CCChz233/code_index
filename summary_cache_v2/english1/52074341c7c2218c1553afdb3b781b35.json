{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe must analyze class-level metadata and method summaries.\n\nClass: BackendV2, abstract class for Backends. It defines immutable properties (num_qubits, etc.) as attributes rather than configuration method. Options attribute for dynamic user-configurable options. Provides optional methods for translation and scheduling stage plugins for transpilation. Subclasses must override run and _default_options.\n\nMethod summaries: many simple helpers for various properties (acquire_channel, control_channel, coupling_map, etc.) and set_options.\n\nGoal: Provide summary of class responsibility and state/behavior.\n\nBusiness intent: Provide a standardized interface for quantum computing backends in Qiskit, exposing immutable device properties and configurable runtime options, enabling custom compilation plugins and execution of quantum circuits.\n\nKeywords: backend, quantum, immutable properties, options, run, transpilation, plugins, provider, qubits, coupling map, instruction schedule, target, configuration, abstract class.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nMake sure no method names verbatim? The constraint: \"Do NOT list method names verbatim.\" That means we should not list method names in summary or business_intent? Probably avoid enumerating method names. In keywords we can include generic terms, not method names.\n\nLet's craft summary: \"Abstract base class that defines the contract for quantum hardware backends, exposing fixed device characteristics as attributes and a mutable options container, and providing hooks for custom compilation stages.\"\n\nBusiness intent: \"Enable providers to implement concrete backends that can be queried for hardware specifications, configured at runtime, and used by the Qiskit runtime and transpiler to execute quantum circuits with optional custom translation or scheduling plugins.\"\n\nKeywords list: [\"quantum backend\", \"immutable device properties\", \"runtime options\", \"transpilation plugins\", \"execution\", \"provider\", \"Qiskit\", \"abstract class\", \"circuit execution\", \"hardware specification\"].\n\nMake JSON.\n\nCheck formatting: start with {{ and end with }}? The example shows double braces but they intend to show placeholder. Actually they say \"Output ONLY valid JSON starting with {{ and ending with }}.\" That seems contradictory: JSON normally starts with { and ends with }. But they say starting with {{ and ending with }}. Possibly they want double braces to avoid markdown formatting. In previous tasks, they ask to output raw JSON without markdown, but they sometimes say \"starting with {\" and ending with \"}\".
