{"summary": "A container that stores the DISK algorithm's output for a single image: the 2‑D keypoint locations, their high‑dimensional descriptors, and associated detection scores, all as tensors. It offers lightweight utilities to query the number of points, retrieve coordinate components, and move the data across devices.", "business_intent": "Facilitate image‑level feature handling for computer‑vision pipelines such as visual localization, image matching, and retrieval by providing a ready‑to‑use representation of DISK features without batching overhead.", "keywords": ["DISK", "keypoints", "descriptors", "detection scores", "tensor", "image features", "computer vision", "feature extraction", "non‑batched", "device transfer"], "summary_hash": "4cfed734717c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:01:23+00:00"}
