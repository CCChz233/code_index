{"summary": "The module provides an example implementation of an image‑to‑image generation pipeline that merges Stable Diffusion with ControlNet conditioning. It defines a pipeline class that encodes text prompts, prepares latent representations, runs the diffusion process with ControlNet guidance, and applies safety checking to output the final images.", "business_intent": "Show developers how to integrate ControlNet into Stable Diffusion for guided image‑to‑image creation, enabling the production of customized visual content while ensuring safety compliance.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "controlnet", "image-to-image generation", "diffusion pipeline", "generative AI", "prompt conditioning", "latent diffusion", "safety checker", "python", "torch"], "summary_hash": "d16809d728b1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:01:38+00:00"}
