{"summary": "This package contains command‑line utilities that fine‑tune a Llama‑2 7B causal language model with LoRA adapters, first through supervised learning on StackExchange data and then via Deep Preference Optimization (DPO). The scripts handle argument parsing, dataset loading, tokenizer and model preparation (including 4‑bit quantization), trainer configuration, execution of the training loops, and saving of the adapted checkpoints for later merging and inference.", "business_intent": "To develop a domain‑specific Llama‑2 model, named StackLlaMa 2, that delivers high‑quality answers to StackExchange‑style questions, enabling researchers or product teams to deploy a customized, efficiently trained language model for knowledge‑base or Q&A applications.", "keywords": ["Llama-2", "LoRA", "PEFT", "Deep Preference Optimization", "DPO", "supervised fine‑tuning", "StackExchange", "language model training", "accelerate", "model merging", "quantization"], "summary_hash": "cb0710359c23", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:03:45+00:00"}
