{"summary": "The module contains integration test suites that exercise the Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) system and its plugin within the Accelerate library. The tests cover core functionality, memory consumption, checkpointing, performance, and a wide range of configuration options such as automatic module wrapping, gradient prefetching, CPU offloading, RAM‑efficient loading, mixed‑precision modes, different sharding strategies, and state‑dict handling.", "business_intent": "Validate and guarantee the correctness, efficiency, and robustness of the FSDP implementation so that developers and users can reliably train large transformer models at scale with Accelerate.", "keywords": ["FSDP", "Fully Sharded Data Parallel", "integration testing", "memory efficiency", "checkpointing", "mixed precision", "sharding strategy", "plugin integration", "Accelerate", "PyTorch", "transformer models", "performance", "CPU offloading", "automatic wrapping", "state dict serialization"], "summary_hash": "ccc4feabe397", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:16:25+00:00"}
