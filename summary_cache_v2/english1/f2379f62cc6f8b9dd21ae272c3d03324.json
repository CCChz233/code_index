{"summary": "This module implements a Checkov Terraform rule that validates the release channel setting of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster resources. It defines a lightweight data holder for the allowed channel values and a check class derived from the generic resource‑value checker, which inspects the relevant Terraform attribute and flags configurations that do not use an approved release channel.", "business_intent": "Ensure GKE clusters are configured with a supported release channel to maintain up‑to‑date, secure, and compliant Kubernetes versions, thereby reducing the risk of running clusters on outdated or unsupported releases.", "keywords": ["GKE", "Google Kubernetes Engine", "release channel", "Terraform", "Checkov", "resource validation", "cloud compliance", "Google Cloud Platform", "configuration check"], "summary_hash": "50cb8f355e3f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:18:26+00:00"}
