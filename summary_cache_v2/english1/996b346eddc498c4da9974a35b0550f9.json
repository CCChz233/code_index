{"summary": "The module defines a loss component for training sentence embedding models using contrastive learning. It supplies a configurable loss class that computes similarity‑based penalties for paired inputs, along with an enumeration of distance metrics suitable for Siamese architectures.", "business_intent": "To enable developers and researchers to train models that can accurately assess semantic similarity or dissimilarity between text pairs, supporting applications such as duplicate detection, information retrieval, and recommendation systems that rely on metric learning.", "keywords": ["contrastive loss", "Siamese network", "distance metric", "sentence embeddings", "metric learning", "similarity training", "PyTorch", "loss function", "semantic similarity", "model fine‑tuning"], "summary_hash": "4b55f766e461", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:53:37+00:00"}
