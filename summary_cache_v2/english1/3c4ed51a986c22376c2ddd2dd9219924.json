{"summary": "The module implements a feature extraction pipeline that loads a trained model, processes a dataset using PyTorch (with optional multiprocessing), and saves the resulting feature vectors for downstream evaluation or analysis. It handles command‑line arguments, logging, and integrates auxiliary utilities such as evaluation metrics and loss functions.", "business_intent": "Enable rapid generation and storage of model embeddings to support research and development of smooth average‑precision loss functions, facilitating faster experimentation and reproducible benchmarking.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "feature extraction", "model embeddings", "dataset loading", "multiprocessing", "evaluation", "loss functions", "command line interface", "logging", "numpy", "matplotlib"], "summary_hash": "6548305a4daa", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:27:26+00:00"}
