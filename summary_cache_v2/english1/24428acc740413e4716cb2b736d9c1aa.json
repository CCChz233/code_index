{"summary": "The module provides a full training pipeline that distills a fast latent consistency model (LCM) from a pretrained Stable Diffusion checkpoint using LoRA adapters. It loads data from WebDataset shards, prepares text‑to‑image samples, runs a DDIM‑based sampler, computes consistency losses, updates LoRA weights, maintains an EMA of the model, and periodically validates generated images. The script orchestrates model loading, optimizer and scheduler setup, distributed acceleration, logging, and checkpoint handling.", "business_intent": "To enable rapid development of lightweight, high‑throughput text‑to‑image diffusion models that can be deployed at scale, reducing inference cost while preserving quality, thereby supporting commercial AI services that require fast image generation.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "stable diffusion", "LoRA", "consistency distillation", "webdataset", "DDIM", "LCM", "text-to-image", "model compression", "fast sampling", "accelerated training", "EMA", "scheduler"], "summary_hash": "d047827fa36b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:59:08+00:00"}
