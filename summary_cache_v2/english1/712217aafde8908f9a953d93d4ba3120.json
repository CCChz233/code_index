{"summary": "The services package implements the core backend logic for an AI model platform. It manages application and variant lifecycle, Docker image building and container orchestration, database CRUD operations via Beanie, user authentication, evaluation of LLM outputs, aggregation of metrics, template synchronization, log retrieval, and result analytics. Each service abstracts a specific domain (e.g., deployment, evaluation, container handling) and coordinates with FastAPI error handling and asynchronous Docker APIs.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to deploy, test, and monitor large language model applications in isolated Docker environments, automatically evaluate model responses against configurable criteria, store and analyze results, and provide secure, user‑centric access through a FastAPI backend.", "keywords": ["Docker", "container management", "LLM evaluation", "aggregation", "FastAPI", "authentication", "MongoDB", "Beanie", "template synchronization", "log management", "result analytics", "application lifecycle", "variant management", "asynchronous operations", "AI model testing"], "summary_hash": "7ae1c52552a3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:30:02+00:00"}
