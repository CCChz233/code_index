{"summary": "Implements a lightweight model designed for model‑parallel training with manual optimization control. It initializes the network, configures the model and optimizer behavior, restores state from checkpoints, and defines the per‑step training logic.", "business_intent": "Provides a minimal reference implementation for developers to test, benchmark, or learn how to run model‑parallel training with explicit (manual) optimization steps.", "keywords": ["model parallel", "manual optimization", "training step", "checkpoint loading", "model configuration", "deep learning", "benchmarking", "reference implementation"], "summary_hash": "2d87d4d66eac", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:50:27+00:00"}
