{"summary": "This module implements default provider classes that encapsulate the creation and handling of label source objects for various computer‑vision tasks such as chip classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The providers abstract away the details of constructing appropriate label source instances from configuration, enabling seamless integration into data pipelines.", "business_intent": "Streamline the setup of training data by automatically supplying correctly configured label sources for different vision tasks, reducing manual configuration effort and ensuring consistency across model training workflows.", "keywords": ["label source", "default provider", "chip classification", "object detection", "semantic segmentation", "data pipeline", "configuration", "machine learning", "raster vision"], "summary_hash": "9e8826cce463", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:00:30+00:00"}
