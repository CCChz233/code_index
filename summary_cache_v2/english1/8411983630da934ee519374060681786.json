{"summary": "Implements a pipeline that performs text‑guided image inpainting using Stable Diffusion combined with the DiffEdit technique. It encodes images into latent space, optionally inverts them, generates masks from textual prompts, runs a conditional UNet denoiser with forward and inverse schedulers, decodes the edited latents back to pixel space, and applies a safety filter. The pipeline also supports loading textual inversion embeddings and LoRA weight files.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and creators with an automated tool to modify or fill image regions based on natural language instructions, streamlining creative editing, rapid prototyping, and safe content generation.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "diffedit", "image inpainting", "text-guided editing", "diffusion pipeline", "latent inversion", "mask generation", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "safety checker"], "summary_hash": "df21aa78ca6d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:17:53+00:00"}
