{"summary": "The module provides a set of small benchmark utilities that construct and execute synthetic Dask task graphs with varying characteristics (e.g., dense connectivity, crosstalk between tasks) using different Dask schedulers (single‑threaded, threaded, multiprocessing). It includes simple helper functions and visualisation support to compare execution times across scheduling strategies.", "business_intent": "Help developers and data engineers evaluate and choose the most appropriate Dask scheduling backend for their workloads by demonstrating how graph density and inter‑task communication affect performance.", "keywords": ["Dask", "task scheduling", "benchmark", "performance analysis", "dense graph", "crosstalk", "multiprocessing", "threaded scheduler", "single‑threaded", "matplotlib", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "89bf6c7f646b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:26:42+00:00"}
