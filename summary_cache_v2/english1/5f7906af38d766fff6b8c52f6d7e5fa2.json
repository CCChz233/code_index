{"summary": "The code defines a pipeline for generating video from a single image using Stable Video Diffusion. It includes a class that handles image encoding, latent preparation, diffusion steps, and video decoding. The pipeline utilizes a VAE, CLIP image encoder, UNet spatio‑temporal model, and a scheduler to produce temporally coherent video frames.", "business_intent": "Enable content creators and developers to quickly generate synthetic video content from a single image, supporting use cases such as advertising, visual effects, game asset creation, and rapid prototyping of motion.", "keywords": ["video generation", "image-to-video", "stable diffusion", "VAE", "CLIP", "UNet", "diffusion scheduler", "latent space", "classifier‑free guidance", "temporal conditioning"], "summary_hash": "45b50b2a9af7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:16:22+00:00"}
