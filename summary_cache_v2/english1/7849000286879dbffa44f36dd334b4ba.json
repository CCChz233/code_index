{"summary": "The module implements a ParallelStrategy class that orchestrates multi‑process model training in PyTorch Lightning. It manages device placement, identifies process ranks, aggregates data across workers, synchronizes gradients, configures data samplers, performs collective reductions, and handles clean shutdown of the distributed environment.", "business_intent": "To provide a reusable, high‑level strategy that enables users to scale their deep‑learning workloads across multiple GPUs or nodes with minimal boilerplate, ensuring correct distributed execution and resource management.", "keywords": ["distributed training", "parallel strategy", "PyTorch Lightning", "device allocation", "rank identification", "gradient synchronization", "data aggregation", "sampler configuration", "collective reduction", "environment cleanup", "multi‑process"], "summary_hash": "7c4dc4b97bb7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:52:54+00:00"}
