{"summary": "Implements a diffusion-based generation pipeline that takes a source image and textual description, encodes them with dual CLIP text encoders and a VAE, runs a conditional UNet denoising process guided by a scheduler, and decodes the result back to an image. Supports optional aesthetic conditioning, classifier‑free guidance, LoRA and IP‑Adapter weight loading, and invisible watermarking.", "business_intent": "Enable applications to create or modify images from natural language prompts (and optional input images) for creative, marketing, or entertainment purposes, offering extensibility through fine‑tuning modules.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "XL", "image generation", "text-to-image", "diffusion pipeline", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "LoRA", "IP‑Adapter", "watermark", "classifier‑free guidance", "aesthetic score", "latent encoding", "prompt encoding"], "summary_hash": "ce075ce9fc32", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:17:15+00:00"}
