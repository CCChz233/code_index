{"summary": "The module implements DreamBooth fine‑tuning for large text‑to‑image diffusion models. It provides a training engine that prepares the model, collates datasets, runs forward and backward passes, updates optimizers, manages checkpoints, and integrates adapter layers for efficient parallel gradient computation on Megatron‑scale systems. Supporting utilities wrap the diffusion model’s inference step and construct the noise schedule used during diffusion.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to quickly adapt pre‑trained diffusion models to new visual concepts by providing a scalable, end‑to‑end DreamBooth training pipeline that works with high‑performance distributed hardware.", "keywords": ["DreamBooth", "text-to-image", "diffusion model", "fine-tuning", "Megatron", "distributed training", "parallel gradient", "adapter integration", "checkpoint management", "noise schedule", "scheduler", "model wrapper"], "summary_hash": "7bb47e76e1f3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:05:55+00:00"}
