It offers utilities to parse JSON payloads from streamed responses, retrieve individual objects, and construct task representations from chunks of data, supporting both synchronous generators and asynchronous generators.", "business_intent": "To simplify handling of streamed or chunked data from language model interactions, allowing developers to easily extract structured information and generate downstream tasks in a consistent, async‑compatible manner.", "keywords": ["iterable", "streaming", "JSON extraction", "async generator", "generator", "data chunks", "task generation", "DSL", "OpenAI schema", "pydantic", "mode"], "summary_hash": "3dbdb9a374c3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:34:41+00:00"}
