{"summary": "Defines a dataclass that aggregates all configuration parameters required to run a benchmark on a specific backend. It reads environment variables, detects available CPU and GPU resources, infers model type, task, and library from the provided model identifier, and performs validation and post‑initialisation adjustments to ensure a consistent runtime setup.", "business_intent": "Provide a unified, auto‑configuring settings object that simplifies the preparation and execution of performance benchmarks for machine‑learning models across various hardware and software backends.", "keywords": ["configuration", "backend", "benchmarking", "hardware detection", "GPU", "CPU", "model metadata", "environment variables", "dataclass", "system utilities"], "summary_hash": "6498f60de21e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:29:07+00:00"}
