{"summary": "The module defines a component that encapsulates the initial hydraulic head or concentration fields for a MODFLOW‑6 groundwater flow model. It offers validation against predefined schemas, supports regridding of the initial data to match different model grids, and provides rendering utilities to generate the appropriate package input for MODFLOW‑6 simulations.", "business_intent": "To simplify the creation, validation, and transformation of initial condition datasets for groundwater modelers, ensuring that starting conditions are correctly formatted, spatially aligned, and ready for integration into MODFLOW‑6 simulations.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW-6", "initial conditions", "groundwater modeling", "hydraulic heads", "concentrations", "regridding", "grid transformation", "data validation", "schema validation", "package rendering", "simulation setup", "spatial data handling"], "summary_hash": "c58208acc3cd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:49:00+00:00"}
