{"summary": "The module supplies a generic class and a suite of helper functions that construct NumPy arrays and Cython memoryviews with diverse type annotations—different dimensionalities, slice specifications, contiguity guarantees, and nogil contexts. These utilities serve as test fixtures for exercising and validating Cython's memoryview typing behavior.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable testing of Cython memoryview type annotations to ensure correct handling of numerical data structures in scientific and high‑performance computing code.", "keywords": ["Cython", "memoryview", "type annotation", "numpy", "slice", "dimension", "contiguity", "nogil", "test utilities", "generic class"], "summary_hash": "d73ca45713b6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:21:03+00:00"}
