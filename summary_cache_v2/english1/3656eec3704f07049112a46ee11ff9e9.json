{"summary": "This module implements the core data structures and policies for managing graph partitions in a distributed DGL environment. It provides abstractions for node and edge partitioning rules, a lightweight range‑based partition book that maps global identifiers to partition‑local IDs, and utilities for handling shared‑memory metadata, supporting both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, multi‑machine graph analytics by efficiently tracking how nodes and edges are distributed across partitions, allowing fast translation between global and local IDs and facilitating shared‑memory access for distributed training and inference.", "keywords": ["graph partition", "distributed processing", "DGL", "node partition policy", "edge partition policy", "range partition book", "shared memory", "heterogeneous graph", "ID mapping", "partition metadata"], "summary_hash": "454e56cad9bc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:38:38+00:00"}
