{"summary": "The plasma.sources package supplies core classes and utilities for describing plasma sources and extracting plasma‑related data. It includes a reader for OpenPMD‑compliant HDF5 files that presents charge density, electric and magnetic fields, and currents with automatic unit handling, a three‑dimensional plasma model that manages spatial domains and computes fields and derived parameters such as Alfven speed, pressure and velocity, and a composition‑focused plasma blob class that stores species information and calculates thermodynamic and coupling quantities without spatial context.", "business_intent": "To provide researchers and engineers with a unified, high‑level toolkit for importing plasma simulation data, modeling plasma configurations, and evaluating key plasma characteristics, thereby accelerating analysis, design, and validation tasks in plasma physics and related applications.", "keywords": ["plasma", "source modeling", "OpenPMD", "HDF5", "field extraction", "electric field", "magnetic field", "charge density", "Alfven speed", "plasma pressure", "velocity", "electron density", "temperature", "ionization", "quantum degeneracy", "coupling parameter", "3D plasma", "data reader", "simulation analysis"], "summary_hash": "b4a92883fd22", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:15:15+00:00"}
