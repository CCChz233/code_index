{"summary": "The script provides a command‑line tool that loads a pretrained Megatron‑GPT embedding model from the NeMo toolkit and generates dense text embeddings for user‑supplied data. It can optionally start an inference server, and it processes inputs using asynchronous and multi‑process pipelines to efficiently produce embeddings at scale.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and data scientists to quickly obtain high‑quality vector representations of text for downstream applications such as search, recommendation, clustering, or any task that requires semantic embeddings, leveraging a large GPT model without building custom inference infrastructure.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "GPT", "embedding generation", "dense embeddings", "NeMo", "inference server", "asynchronous processing", "multiprocessing", "text embeddings", "NLP", "information retrieval", "vectorization"], "summary_hash": "01176dcf29d7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:59:12+00:00"}
