{"summary": "This test module contains a unittest suite that verifies the behavior of the random axis flip transform for dictionary-based data. It checks probability handling, axis selection, metadata propagation, compatibility with lazy resampling, and the ability to invert the transformation, ensuring deterministic outcomes when a seed is set.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability and correctness of the random axis flipping augmentation used in medical imaging pipelines, preventing regressions and ensuring consistent preprocessing across diverse datasets.", "keywords": ["random axis flip", "unit testing", "MONAI", "data augmentation", "3D medical imaging", "metadata tracking", "lazy evaluation", "invertibility", "reproducibility"], "summary_hash": "5bca18888b60", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:01:36+00:00"}
