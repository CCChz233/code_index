{"summary": "DexiNed encapsulates the DXtrem deep neural network architecture for image edge detection. It processes an input image tensor and produces a hierarchy of intermediate feature maps, with the final output being a single‑channel edge probability map of the same spatial dimensions as the input.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use, high‑performance edge detection component that can be integrated into computer‑vision systems for tasks such as scene understanding, object segmentation, image preprocessing, and visual analytics.", "keywords": ["edge detection", "deep learning", "convolutional neural network", "feature extraction", "computer vision", "PyTorch", "DXtrem", "image processing", "pretrained model", "inference"], "summary_hash": "abe14d585aac", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:45:01+00:00"}
