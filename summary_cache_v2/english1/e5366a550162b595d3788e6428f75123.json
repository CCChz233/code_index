{"summary": "The module provides utilities to clean, detokenize, and format raw text files into a structured dataset suitable for training neural language models. It traverses directories, applies tokenization and detokenization, removes unwanted newline characters, and writes the processed sentences to JSON files, optionally using parallel processing for efficiency.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable and scalable preparation of textual corpora for language model training, ensuring consistent formatting and high-quality input data for downstream NLP applications.", "keywords": ["preprocessing", "tokenization", "detokenization", "text cleaning", "language modeling", "dataset preparation", "multiprocessing", "NeMo", "MosesDetokenizer", "JSON output"], "summary_hash": "cb240c3e9eac", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:49:27+00:00"}
