{"summary": "This module provides tools for generating calibrated pulse schedules for the RZXGate by adapting existing cross‑resonance (CX) calibrations. It defines an enumeration that categorizes the available CR calibration data and includes two builder classes—one that uses an echoed CR pulse and another that omits the echo—to create RZX schedules with adjusted amplitude or duration to achieve the target rotation angle.", "business_intent": "Enable the transpiler to replace abstract RZX gates with hardware‑specific calibrated pulse sequences, leveraging backend cross‑resonance calibration data to improve gate fidelity and ensure compatibility with the target quantum device.", "keywords": ["RZX gate", "cross‑resonance calibration", "pulse schedule", "transpiler builder", "amplitude adjustment", "duration scaling", "echoed pulse", "quantum backend", "hardware‑aware compilation", "schedule generation"], "summary_hash": "410d874663ea", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:08:47+00:00"}
