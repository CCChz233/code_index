{"summary": "Encapsulates the definition and handling of temporal discretization for a simulation stress period, managing the base timestep length, number of sub‑steps, transient versus steady‑state mode, and an optional geometric progression multiplier. Includes validation, conversion to package format, and persistence capabilities.", "business_intent": "Provide a clear, consistent interface for configuring and managing time‑stepping schemes in groundwater flow models, ensuring that transport or other coupled packages align with the flow model’s temporal discretization for both transient and steady‑state simulations.", "keywords": ["time discretization", "timestep duration", "number of timesteps", "transient simulation", "steady-state", "geometric progression", "MODMODFLOW compatibility", "parameter validation", "package rendering", "data persistence"], "summary_hash": "848f307cb445", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:29:25+00:00"}
