{"summary": "The preprocessing package supplies a unified framework for cleaning and transforming raw audio into model‑ready acoustic features for text‑to‑speech systems. It includes silence‑removal utilities (energy‑based and VAD), feature extractors that compute mel‑spectrograms, energy contours, and pitch signals, and post‑processing modules that apply scaling, logarithmic compression, mean‑variance and speaker‑level normalization.", "business_intent": "Automate and standardize audio preparation for TTS pipelines to improve data quality, accelerate model training, and boost synthesis performance while minimizing manual preprocessing effort.", "keywords": ["audio trimming", "silence removal", "voice activity detection", "energy based trimming", "feature extraction", "mel spectrogram", "energy contour", "pitch extraction", "feature scaling", "log compression", "mean variance normalization", "speaker normalization", "TTS preprocessing", "acoustic features", "data pipeline"], "summary_hash": "8ecdddb420fe", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:02:13+00:00"}
