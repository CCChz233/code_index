{"summary": "This module implements a loss component that calculates the Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNNT) loss specifically adapted for self‑supervised learning scenarios in speech recognition. It integrates with the NeMo core loss framework, enforces neural type specifications for inputs such as log‑probabilities, target labels, and sequence lengths, and provides a unified interface for loss evaluation during model training.", "business_intent": "Enable end‑to‑end training of ASR models using RNNT loss within self‑supervised pre‑training or fine‑tuning pipelines, thereby improving model performance and simplifying loss integration in speech recognition workflows.", "keywords": ["RNNT", "loss", "self-supervised learning", "ASR", "speech recognition", "NeMo", "neural types", "transducer", "training"], "summary_hash": "c61d3708a92c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:18:38+00:00"}
