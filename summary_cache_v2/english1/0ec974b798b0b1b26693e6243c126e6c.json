{"summary": "The script serves as an example driver for training and testing a variety of NeMo dialogue models. It loads a Hydra configuration that defines model architecture, datasets, optimizer, and PyTorch Lightning trainer settings, then instantiates the selected dialogue model (e.g., GPT‑based classification, generation, zero‑shot intent, intent‑slot classification, nearest‑neighbour, S2S generation, or SGD QA) and runs either a training or evaluation run based on a flag.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to quickly reproduce and experiment with state‑of‑the‑art dialogue systems by providing a ready‑to‑run example that integrates model configuration, data handling, and distributed training/evaluation within the NeMo framework.", "keywords": ["NeMo", "dialogue modeling", "training", "evaluation", "configuration", "PyTorch Lightning", "GPT", "classification", "generation", "zero‑shot intent", "intent‑slot", "nearest neighbour", "S2S generation", "SGD QA", "distributed training"], "summary_hash": "89cab22ac8e7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:45:43+00:00"}
