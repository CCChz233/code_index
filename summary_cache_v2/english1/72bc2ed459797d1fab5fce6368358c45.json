{"summary": "This script demonstrates how to train a HuggingFace transformer model for sequence classification using Accelerate's LocalSGD optimizer. It loads a dataset, tokenizes the text, builds data loaders, sets up the model, optimizer, and learning‑rate scheduler, and runs a distributed training loop with periodic evaluation.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example for developers to implement scalable, multi‑GPU training of NLP classification models using LocalSGD, facilitating faster convergence and reduced communication overhead in production or research environments.", "keywords": ["accelerate", "LocalSGD", "distributed training", "transformers", "sequence classification", "tokenization", "data loader", "optimizer", "learning rate scheduler", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "44923949c19f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:17:20+00:00"}
