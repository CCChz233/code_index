{"summary": "A transformation class that injects Gibbs‑type artifacts into 2‑D or 3‑D MRI volumes, applying the effect uniformly across all image channels. The artifact intensity is controlled by a scalar parameter ranging from no effect to full‑strength Gibbs noise.", "business_intent": "Generate realistic MRI artifact variations for data‑augmentation, model robustness testing, and research on artifact mitigation in medical imaging pipelines.", "keywords": ["MRI", "Gibbs artifact", "noise augmentation", "image transformation", "2D", "3D", "medical imaging", "data augmentation", "artifact simulation", "alpha parameter"], "summary_hash": "3f080d680f82", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:52:41+00:00"}
