{"summary": "The module defines dataset classes that facilitate loading whole‑slide images and extracting fixed‑size patches for deep‑learning workflows. It supports mask‑guided sampling, random patch selection, and sliding‑window extraction, while handling metadata, optional labels, and user‑defined transforms via a configurable WSI reader.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible and efficient way to prepare pathology whole‑slide image data for model training and inference by offering multiple patch‑sampling strategies and seamless integration with preprocessing pipelines.", "keywords": ["whole slide image", "WSI", "patch extraction", "mask guided sampling", "sliding window", "random patches", "dataset", "deep learning", "medical imaging", "pathology", "metadata", "transforms", "data loading"], "summary_hash": "f8f8a8cee5a2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:12:19+00:00"}
