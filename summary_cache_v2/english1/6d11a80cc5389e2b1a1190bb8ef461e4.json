{"summary": "The Trajectory class encapsulates a time‑indexed series of (x, y) coordinates and provides interpolation capabilities to retrieve the position at any arbitrary time point. It supports constructing instances from raw arrays or external files, updating internal interpolators, and persisting data back to storage.", "business_intent": "Enable applications such as motion tracking, animation, robotics, or any domain that requires smooth position estimation over time by offering a simple, file‑compatible trajectory representation with built‑in interpolation.", "keywords": ["trajectory", "interpolation", "time series", "position", "x y coordinates", "load from file", "save to file", "motion analysis", "animation", "robotics"], "summary_hash": "781b3577a193", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:15:12+00:00"}
