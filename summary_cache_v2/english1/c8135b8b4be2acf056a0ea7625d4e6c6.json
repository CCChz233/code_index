{"summary": "Implements a full training workflow for adapting a stable diffusion inpainting model to a specific scene using only a few reference images. It provides a dataset loader for source‑target image pairs with masks, preprocessing and tokenization, data collation, checkpoint handling, validation logging, and command‑line argument parsing. The main routine sets up distributed training with Accelerate, configures the inpainting pipeline, optionally integrates LoRA adapters, and runs the optimization loop with support for gradient checkpointing, 8‑bit optimizers, memory‑efficient attention, and gradient‑to‑none tricks, while periodically evaluating and saving the fine‑tuned model.", "business_intent": "Allow creators, designers, and developers to quickly personalize text‑to‑image inpainting models for custom scenes with minimal data, enabling tailored visual content generation for advertising, media production, virtual environments, and other commercial applications.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "inpainting", "fine‑tuning", "LoRA", "Accelerate", "low‑memory training", "gradient checkpointing", "8‑bit optimizer", "xformers", "stable diffusion", "personalized generation"], "summary_hash": "b3225cf21712", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:39:03+00:00"}
