{"summary": "This module defines an abstract operation interface and concrete utilities for computing statistical aggregates—such as mean, median, min, max, percentile, and standard deviation—on image, ndarray, or tensor samples. It also provides a registry system that applies a configurable set of aggregation functions to dictionaries of data, yielding summarized metric collections.", "business_intent": "Equip the MONAI Auto3DSeg pipeline with reusable, extensible statistical computation tools to analyze and summarize dataset characteristics, supporting model configuration, validation, and reporting processes.", "keywords": ["statistics", "aggregation", "percentile", "mean", "median", "minimum", "maximum", "standard deviation", "registry", "extensibility", "tensor", "image", "numpy", "pytorch", "MONAI", "Auto3DSeg"], "summary_hash": "146ce8b10f24", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:29:14+00:00"}
