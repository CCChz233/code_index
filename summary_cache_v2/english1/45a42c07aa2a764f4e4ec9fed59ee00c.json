{"summary": "Provides a framework for applying activation patches to transformer models, allowing users to replace or modify specific internal activations (such as attention heads, layer outputs, or positional patterns) and quantify the resulting changes in model predictions. Includes a generic patching engine, specialized configuration helpers, and utilities for constructing patching specifications and recording results.", "business_intent": "Facilitate interpretability and causal analysis of transformer networks by enabling systematic manipulation of internal activations and measuring their impact on downstream outputs.", "keywords": ["activation patching", "transformer", "causal analysis", "model interpretability", "attention head", "layer manipulation", "hook", "output effect", "utility functions", "dataframe generation"], "summary_hash": "719780092dbb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:21:01+00:00"}
