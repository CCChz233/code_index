{"summary": "A suite of MONAI transforms that prepare and manipulate data for the DeepGrow interactive segmentation application. They generate guidance tensors from user clicks, add Gaussian‑blurred guidance channels, insert random or initial seed points, extract 2‑D slices from 3‑D volumes, identify valid slices and discrepancy regions between ground truth and predictions, resize guidance information to match image preprocessing, restore predicted labels to the original image space, and perform spatial cropping based on foreground or guidance masks.", "business_intent": "Enable an end‑to‑end interactive medical image segmentation workflow where clinicians can provide click‑based guidance, and the system can train and infer segmentation models while correctly handling preprocessing, slice selection, and post‑processing of guidance and label data.", "keywords": ["interactive segmentation", "medical imaging", "user clicks", "guidance maps", "Gaussian blur", "random guidance", "seed point insertion", "2D slice extraction", "discrepancy detection", "resize guidance", "label restoration", "spatial cropping", "foreground detection", "MONAI", "deep learning transforms"], "summary_hash": "e4f0acb9b921", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:25:32+00:00"}
