{"summary": "A comprehensive test suite that validates the migration autodetector’s ability to recognize and represent a wide spectrum of model and field modifications, dependency relationships, and operation ordering. The tests simulate scenarios such as adding, removing, and altering fields; creating, deleting, and renaming models; handling foreign keys, many‑to‑many relations, proxy, swappable, and unmanaged models; and exercising custom migration naming and deconstructible objects, ensuring the autodetector generates correct migration operations.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that automatic migration generation for the framework accurately captures schema evolution, resolves dependencies, and produces reliable migration files, thereby reducing manual migration effort and preventing database inconsistencies.", "keywords": ["migration autodetector", "schema detection", "field addition", "field removal", "field alteration", "model creation", "model deletion", "model renaming", "foreign key", "many-to-many", "proxy model", "swappable model", "unmanaged model", "deconstructible object", "custom migration naming", "dependency resolution", "operation ordering"], "summary_hash": "ac3f06d53c83", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:52:12+00:00"}
