{"summary": "The module defines a collection of neural‑network upsampling layers for one‑, two‑ and three‑dimensional tensors, including variants that use FIR filtering, configurable padding, and optional (transposed) convolutions to reshape or refine channel dimensions. It also provides lightweight helper utilities for performing up‑sample‑filter‑down operations.", "business_intent": "Supply flexible, high‑quality upsampling components for diffusion‑based generative models such as video synthesis, enabling efficient resolution scaling while preserving detail and supporting various architectural needs.", "keywords": ["upsampling", "FIR filter", "convolution", "transposed convolution", "padding", "1D", "2D", "3D", "video generation", "diffusion models", "torch"], "summary_hash": "4702c849de54", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:15:34+00:00"}
