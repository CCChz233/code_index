{"summary": "Provides a comprehensive caching layer for language model API calls, generating deterministic cache keys from request parameters and supporting multiple storage backends (in‑memory, disk, Redis, S3, Qdrant, etc.). Offers synchronous, asynchronous, and batch interfaces to store and retrieve cached responses, handling a wide range of model request schemas.", "business_intent": "Reduce redundant LLM requests, lower latency and cost, and improve application scalability by reusing prior responses through a flexible, multi‑backend cache system.", "keywords": ["caching", "language model", "deterministic key", "Redis", "asynchronous", "batch processing", "in‑memory cache", "disk cache", "S3 storage", "semantic cache", "performance optimization"], "summary_hash": "07b91f97ddcf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:46:30+00:00"}
