{"summary": "The module implements interactive editing of flight trajectories on a Matplotlib canvas. It defines custom path objects that store waypoints and generate interpolated vertices for horizontal (great‑circle) and vertical profiles, and provides interactor classes that bind mouse actions to these paths, allowing users to select, move, insert, or delete waypoints while keeping the underlying flight‑track data synchronized and the display refreshed.", "business_intent": "To give mission planners and analysts a graphical tool for creating, adjusting, and visualising flight routes and altitude profiles directly within the Mission Support System, improving the efficiency and accuracy of flight‑path planning and review.", "keywords": ["matplotlib", "interactive editing", "flight path", "waypoints", "horizontal trajectory", "vertical profile", "mouse events", "interpolation", "mission support system", "visualisation"], "summary_hash": "4c9cbd7488a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:49:40+00:00"}
