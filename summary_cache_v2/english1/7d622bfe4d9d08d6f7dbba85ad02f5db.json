{"summary": "The module offers example training scripts that demonstrate how to fine‑tune the CogVideoX diffusion model for both text‑to‑video and image‑to‑video generation using Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It includes utilities for loading and preprocessing video datasets, encoding prompts and video frames, configuring optimizers and learning‑rate schedules, running distributed training with Accelerate, performing periodic validation, and saving checkpoints or model cards to the Hugging Face Hub.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with ready‑to‑use, parameter‑efficient workflows to adapt large video generation models to custom concepts or styles, lowering computational costs and enabling rapid deployment of specialized video generation services.", "keywords": ["LoRA", "parameter-efficient fine-tuning", "CogVideoX", "video diffusion", "text-to-video", "image-to-video", "distributed training", "Accelerate", "dataset preprocessing", "validation", "checkpointing", "Hugging Face Hub"], "summary_hash": "dd6b8c4596e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:37:09+00:00"}
