{"summary": "A command‑line utility that reads parallel source‑target text files, evaluates each sentence pair’s length and the ratio between source and target lengths, and discards pairs that fall outside configurable thresholds. It supports multiprocessing, progress reporting, and writes the filtered corpus along with optional logging and result concatenation.", "business_intent": "To clean and curate high‑quality training data for neural machine translation models by automatically removing noisy or mismatched sentence pairs, thereby improving model accuracy and training efficiency.", "keywords": ["neural machine translation", "data cleaning", "length filter", "length ratio", "parallel corpus preprocessing", "command line script", "multiprocessing", "logging"], "summary_hash": "59a202bdf69d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:45:16+00:00"}
