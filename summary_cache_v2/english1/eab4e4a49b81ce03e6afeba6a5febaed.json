{"summary": "Defines a configurable 2‑D conditional UNet architecture used as the backbone of diffusion models, integrating various attention processors, time and text/image embeddings, and optional adapter mechanisms for fine‑tuning. It manages model construction, loading, and the forward computation that produces conditioned latent representations.", "business_intent": "Supply a versatile neural network component that enables conditional generative diffusion tasks (e.g., text‑to‑image, image‑to‑image) while supporting extensible attention schemes and parameter‑efficient adaptation techniques for commercial AI content creation pipelines.", "keywords": ["UNet", "conditional diffusion", "cross‑attention", "embeddings", "timesteps", "adapter", "LoRA", "PEFT", "PyTorch", "generative model"], "summary_hash": "61fab3473a06", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:28:42+00:00"}
