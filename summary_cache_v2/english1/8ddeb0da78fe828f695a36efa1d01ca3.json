{"summary": "A UNet upsampling module that combines residual blocks with optional upsampling layers and applies SPADE normalization to inject semantic conditioning into the feature maps. It supports configurable spatial dimensions, channel sizes, timestep embeddings, and group normalization settings.", "business_intent": "Facilitates high‑resolution, semantically guided image generation or reconstruction in deep learning pipelines such as diffusion models or conditional GANs, enabling precise control over the upscaled output based on semantic maps.", "keywords": ["UNet", "upsampling", "residual block", "SPADE normalization", "semantic conditioning", "group normalization", "multi‑dimensional", "generative modeling", "image synthesis"], "summary_hash": "cfe6151050ad", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:32:05+00:00"}
