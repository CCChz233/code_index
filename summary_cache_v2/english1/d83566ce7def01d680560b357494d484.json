{"summary": "This module implements a SentencePiece‑based tokenizer that wraps a trained SentencePiece model, providing methods to split text into subword tokens, map tokens to integer IDs and back, and manage special token IDs such as start‑of‑sentence, end‑of‑sentence, padding, mask, unknown, classification and separator tokens. It also allows adding custom special tokens and exposing the underlying vocabulary for downstream NLP components.", "business_intent": "Enable consistent subword tokenization and special‑token handling for speech and language models within the NeMo framework, facilitating model training, inference, and integration with other components that require token‑to‑ID conversion and vocabulary access.", "keywords": ["sentencepiece", "tokenizer", "subword tokenization", "special tokens", "vocabulary", "token‑id mapping", "NLP preprocessing", "NeMo", "text encoding"], "summary_hash": "d0976b3fcbe1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:52:21+00:00"}
