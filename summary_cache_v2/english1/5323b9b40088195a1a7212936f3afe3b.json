{"summary": "This module implements an asynchronous worker that coordinates the lifecycle of Prefect events. It prepares event items, enriches them with related run resources, and dispatches them through the appropriate client (cloud or null) based on configuration. The worker utilizes a shared queue service and context management to ensure reliable event handling across the system, and includes a convenience routine for direct emission to Prefect Cloud.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable, configurable mechanism for capturing and sending Prefect events to Prefect Cloud (or discarding them) during workflow execution, supporting experimental features and context propagation.", "keywords": ["events", "worker", "Prefect Cloud", "event client", "queue service", "async processing", "related resources", "context management", "event emission"], "summary_hash": "6f731c8e7771", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:00:40+00:00"}
