{"summary": "AutoencoderOobleck implements a neural autoencoder that transforms raw audio waveforms into compact latent vectors and reconstructs waveforms from those latents. The architecture is configurable via hidden sizes, down‑sampling ratios, channel multipliers, and decoder dimensions, and supports mono or stereo signals at a specified sampling rate. It inherits generic model utilities for tasks such as downloading and saving.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient compression, storage, and generation of audio data for applications like audio synthesis, transmission, and downstream machine‑learning pipelines, providing a ready‑to‑use component for audio representation learning.", "keywords": ["audio autoencoder", "waveform compression", "latent representation", "neural encoder", "neural decoder", "Stable Audio", "deep learning", "sampling rate", "stereo audio", "model utilities"], "summary_hash": "4026e6417391", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:35:17+00:00"}
