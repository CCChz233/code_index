{"summary": "The module defines builders that generate configuration objects and instantiate decoder layer components for the Falcon transformer architecture, preparing them for TensorRT‑LLM export. It assembles attention, feed‑forward, normalization, activation, and quantization settings into a ready‑to‑use decoder layer compatible with high‑performance inference.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the conversion and deployment of Falcon language models to TensorRT, enabling efficient inference in production environments.", "keywords": ["Falcon", "decoder layer", "builder", "configuration", "TensorRT", "LLM", "attention", "MLP", "layer normalization", "quantization", "model export", "high‑performance inference"], "summary_hash": "87da2d01502a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:39:51+00:00"}
