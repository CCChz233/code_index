{"summary": "The dihedral package implements a representation of N‑qubit CNOT‑Dihedral group elements as invertible binary affine maps combined with degree‑≤3 phase polynomials over Z₈. It supplies tools to construct these operators from circuits, perform algebraic operations (composition, tensor product, adjoint), and convert them back into Qiskit circuit, gate, matrix, or generic Operator forms. Additional utilities handle circuit synthesis, barrier insertion, delay handling, and random generation of such operators.", "business_intent": "Provide a robust framework for creating, manipulating, and simulating CNOT‑Dihedral quantum operators, facilitating research, algorithm development, and benchmarking within the Qiskit ecosystem.", "keywords": ["CNOT-dihedral", "quantum operator", "affine map", "phase polynomial", "circuit synthesis", "random operator", "Qiskit", "quantum simulation", "quantum information"], "summary_hash": "41f0947b92b4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:06:32+00:00"}
