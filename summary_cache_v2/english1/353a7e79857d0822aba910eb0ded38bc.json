{"summary": "The module offers a parser that reads StarkNet contract ABI JSON files and builds structured dataclass representations of functions, events, structs, enums, and types, while handling type resolution and reference‑cycle detection. It also includes a Lark transformer that converts parsed ABI syntax trees into internal Cairo type objects, providing utilities for constructing arrays, booleans, identifiers, numeric and composite types.", "business_intent": "Facilitate reliable ingestion and interpretation of StarkNet contract ABIs so that developers can validate, generate code for, and interact with contracts programmatically.", "keywords": ["StarkNet", "ABI", "parser", "Lark", "Cairo types", "dataclasses", "type resolution", "enum", "struct", "event", "function", "reference cycle detection"], "summary_hash": "f1a076a94e89", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:55:46+00:00"}
