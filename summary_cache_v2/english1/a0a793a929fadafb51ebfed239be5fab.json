{"summary": "This module implements a deprecated stable‑diffusion variant that performs text‑guided pixel‑level image editing (Pix2Pix Zero). It defines data structures for pipeline outputs, custom attention handling, and L2 reconstruction loss, and assembles a diffusion pipeline that combines a VAE, CLIP text encoder, conditional UNet, and multiple schedulers to transform input images according to textual prompts, with optional safety checking.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and creative professionals to modify or enhance images based on natural language instructions while preserving the original layout, supporting applications such as content creation, visual effects, and rapid prototyping of image edits.", "keywords": ["image-to-image translation", "stable diffusion", "Pix2Pix Zero", "text‑guided editing", "diffusion pipeline", "VAE", "CLIP encoder", "UNet", "attention processor", "L2 loss", "safety checker", "scheduler"], "summary_hash": "8c06e341fe6d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:27:34+00:00"}
