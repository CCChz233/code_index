{"summary": "The module serves as a bridge between Litellm and Google Gemini models (Vertex AI and AI Studio). It translates OpenAI‑style chat and completion requests into Gemini's required format, manages message histories, system prompts, image data, tool calls, and request headers for both synchronous and asynchronous operations. It also provides a wrapper that constructs requests, parses responses, supports streaming, handles errors, and tracks token usage while exposing familiar OpenAI‑like interfaces.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to seamlessly integrate and utilize Google Gemini models within Litellm using familiar OpenAI‑compatible APIs, enabling advanced capabilities such as function calling, multimodal inputs, safety controls, and usage analytics.", "keywords": ["Gemini", "Vertex AI", "Google AI Studio", "Litellm integration", "OpenAI compatibility", "payload transformation", "streaming generation", "asynchronous calls", "function calling", "image handling", "safety settings", "token usage tracking"], "summary_hash": "d8bb1dd4c522", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:10:49+00:00"}
