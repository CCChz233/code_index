{"summary": "This module defines a ScaleBiasLayer class that applies an element-wise affine transformation (scale and bias) to its input, optionally learning the scale and bias parameters. It can be disabled to act as a pass-through, serving as a lightweight alternative to full layer normalization.", "business_intent": "The purpose of this module is to provide a flexible and efficient layer for neural networks that can either perform scaling and biasing or act as a no-op, depending on configuration. This can be useful in various deep learning models where layer normalization might be too costly or unnecessary.", "keywords": ["ScaleBiasLayer", "affine transformation", "scale and bias", "layer normalization alternative", "neural network layer"], "summary_hash": "7592d8e00b5b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:16:05+00:00"}
