{"summary": "A suite of utilities that constitute the core infrastructure for gathering system facts in Ansible. It includes a base collector with key normalization, namespace handling, and platform filtering; compatibility helpers for simple fact retrieval; namespace classes for processing and transforming fact data; abstractions for detecting and interacting with system package managers; parsers for sysctl kernel parameters; timeout decorators to run fact‑gathering functions safely; and generic file‑system helpers for reading files and determining mount sizes.", "business_intent": "To enable Ansible modules to consistently and efficiently collect detailed system information across diverse platforms, providing extensible, reusable components that simplify fact extraction, ensure compatibility, and improve reliability of automation workflows.", "keywords": ["Ansible", "fact gathering", "collector", "namespace", "compatibility", "package manager abstraction", "sysctl parsing", "timeout handling", "utility functions", "system information", "platform detection", "data normalization"], "summary_hash": "a57ff70563af", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T18:27:52+00:00"}
