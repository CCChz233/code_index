{"summary": "This module supplies helper utilities for loading pretrained transformer models from external repositories. It resolves model name aliases, fetches model configurations and checkpoint state dictionaries, and includes conversion routines that translate weights from a variety of HuggingFace architectures into the library's internal format, enabling a unified representation for downstream analysis.", "business_intent": "Facilitate seamless integration of external pretrained language models into the analysis framework, allowing researchers and developers to load, configure, and standardize models from multiple architectures with minimal effort.", "keywords": ["pretrained", "model loading", "weight conversion", "HuggingFace", "transformer", "alias mapping", "configuration", "state dict", "GPT", "LLaMA", "BERT", "OPT", "NeoX", "model registry"], "summary_hash": "b8ef74ff08fd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:21:06+00:00"}
