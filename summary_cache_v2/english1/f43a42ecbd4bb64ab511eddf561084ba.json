{"summary": "Defines an abstract base class for Azure Resource Manager (ARM) checks that examine a specific configuration property of a resource and raise a failure when the property contains negative or otherwise disallowed values. The class encapsulates metadata about the target key, the set of forbidden values (including regex patterns for variable-dependent expressions), and the logic to retrieve and evaluate the property within a resource definition, integrating with Checkov's checking framework.", "business_intent": "To provide a reusable mechanism for static analysis of ARM templates that enforces non‑negative or allowed values for critical configuration settings, thereby preventing misconfigurations, runtime errors, and compliance violations in Azure deployments.", "keywords": ["ARM", "Azure", "Checkov", "resource validation", "negative value check", "configuration compliance", "infrastructure as code", "static analysis", "base check class", "forbidden values", "regex validation"], "summary_hash": "1fb0aa7e556d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T19:29:53+00:00"}
