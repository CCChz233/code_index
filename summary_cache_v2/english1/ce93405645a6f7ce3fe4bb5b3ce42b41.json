{"summary": "This module offers a full suite for handling quantum states in Qiskit, defining an abstract base class and concrete types for pure statevectors, mixed density matrices, and stabilizer states. It provides operations such as arithmetic, circuit evolution, measurement simulation, subsystem extraction, conversion between representations, and utilities for generating random states. Additionally, it includes functions to compute quantum‑information quantities like fidelity, entropy, and entanglement measures.", "business_intent": "To give developers and researchers a robust toolkit for modeling, simulating, and analyzing quantum states, facilitating quantum algorithm development, benchmarking, and quantum information research within the Qiskit ecosystem.", "keywords": ["quantum state representation", "density matrix", "statevector", "stabilizer state", "quantum information metrics", "random quantum states", "partial trace", "measurement simulation", "state evolution", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "674894035150", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:06:11+00:00"}
