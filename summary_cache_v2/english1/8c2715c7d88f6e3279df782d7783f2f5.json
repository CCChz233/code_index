{"summary": "The module implements a training pipeline for personalizing text-to-image diffusion models using DreamBooth with Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It defines dataset utilities that load and preprocess instance‑specific and class‑wide images, tokenizes associated prompts, and supplies collated batches for multi‑GPU training. Helper functions manage model loading, checkpoint handling, validation logging, and model‑card generation. The main routine parses configuration arguments, sets up the accelerator, prepares the diffusion pipeline, configures optimizers and schedulers, and runs the fine‑tuning loop, optionally applying a scheduled Huber loss.", "business_intent": "Enable businesses to quickly create customized image generation models that reflect specific visual styles or subjects, allowing tailored content creation for marketing, product design, or brand‑specific visual assets without training a model from scratch.", "keywords": ["DreamBooth", "LoRA", "diffusion model fine‑tuning", "image generation", "customized visual assets", "dataset preprocessing", "prompt tokenization", "accelerate", "Hugging Face", "scheduled Huber loss"], "summary_hash": "2773111863b7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:08:10+00:00"}
