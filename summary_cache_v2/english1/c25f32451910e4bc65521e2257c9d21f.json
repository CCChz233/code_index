{"summary": "Implements the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) variant that incorporates edge features. In each forward pass a node’s new representation is computed by adding a scaled self‑feature (epsilon) to the ReLU‑activated sum of neighboring node features plus the associated edge features, followed by an optional user‑provided transformation.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable graph convolution layer for deep learning models that need expressive node embeddings while leveraging both node and edge attributes, enabling downstream tasks such as molecular property prediction, social network analysis, and other relational data problems.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "convolution", "edge features", "message passing", "learnable epsilon", "ReLU", "node aggregation", "DGL", "GINE", "representation learning"], "summary_hash": "d7da503c143d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:45:50+00:00"}
