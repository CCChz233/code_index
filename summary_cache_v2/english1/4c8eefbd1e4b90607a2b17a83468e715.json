{"summary": "Applies a random 2D shear transformation to image tensors, preserving the image centre. The shear angles are sampled from a configurable range (single‑axis or dual‑axis), with optional probability, batch‑wise consistency, resampling and padding options, and the class can also compute the inverse transform.", "business_intent": "Provides data augmentation for computer‑vision models by introducing random shear distortions, helping improve robustness and generalisation during training.", "keywords": ["random shear", "data augmentation", "image transformation", "affine warp", "torch", "kornia", "batch processing", "probability", "inverse transform", "padding mode", "resampling"], "summary_hash": "ec48f40619b0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:56:42+00:00"}
