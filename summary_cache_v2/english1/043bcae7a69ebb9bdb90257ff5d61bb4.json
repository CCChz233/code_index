{"summary": "This module contains a pytest‑based test suite that validates the generation and handling of MODFLOW‑6 groundwater‑flow exchange (gwfgwf) files. It provides utilities for cleaning comment lines and creating sample structured and unstructured exchange datasets, then runs a series of tests to confirm that model options (e.g., dewatered, newton, variable‑cv, xt3d, flow saving) are correctly propagated and that error‑clipping behavior works as intended.", "business_intent": "Ensure that groundwater flow model exchange files are produced accurately and that configuration options are reliably transmitted through the MF6 modeling workflow, thereby supporting robust hydrogeological simulations.", "keywords": ["testing", "groundwater modeling", "MODFLOW 6", "exchange files", "structured grid", "unstructured grid", "option propagation", "error clipping", "unit testing", "pytest", "xarray"], "summary_hash": "8be113d5bde0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:53:28+00:00"}
