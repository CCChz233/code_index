{"summary": "The module implements a suite of dataset classes for cross‑lingual masked language modeling and translation within the Megatron framework. It provides memory‑mapped binary and text‑based datasets that construct training samples on demand, support efficient random access, and handle sequence‑to‑sequence pair generation for multilingual model training.", "business_intent": "To facilitate scalable training of large multilingual language models by offering high‑performance data pipelines that can serve masked language modeling and translation examples across many languages, reducing I/O overhead and simplifying integration with Megatron‑based NLP systems.", "keywords": ["cross-lingual", "masked language modeling", "translation", "dataset", "memory-mapped", "Megatron", "multilingual", "sequence-to-sequence", "efficient loading", "NLP"], "summary_hash": "2f73b51ec947", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:29:52+00:00"}
