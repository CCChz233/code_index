{"summary": "A test suite that validates the behavior of a time‑based mapping structure, confirming that expired entries are automatically removed during retrieval, iteration, and size checks, that updating an entry refreshes its expiry, that the structure enforces a maximum capacity by evicting the oldest items, that standard item assignment works, that reserved keys are protected, and that various expiration intervals are handled correctly.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and reliability of a cache‑like data structure with automatic expiration and size‑based eviction, supporting robust usage in applications that require time‑sensitive storage and controlled memory usage.", "keywords": ["testing", "expiring mapping", "cache", "automatic eviction", "time‑based expiration", "size limit", "reserved keys", "unit tests", "Python"], "summary_hash": "c32e1795fd59", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:03:50+00:00"}
