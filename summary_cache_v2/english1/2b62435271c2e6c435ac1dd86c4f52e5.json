{"summary": "The module contains a suite of unit tests that exercise Lightning's CombinedLoader utility, checking its behavior across different loader configurations (dict, list, namedtuple), handling of iterable and map-style datasets, length semantics, state dict saving/loading, pickling support, mode validation, iterator and sequential limits, and compatibility with distributed training and max‑size cycling.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the CombinedLoader component works reliably in various training scenarios, providing confidence that data loading logic integrates correctly with Lightning's training loops, distributed strategies, and serialization mechanisms.", "keywords": ["CombinedLoader", "Lightning", "PyTorch", "data loading", "unit tests", "iterable dataset", "distributed training", "state dict", "pickling", "loader modes", "max size cycle", "sequential mode", "iterator limits"], "summary_hash": "6fb39c4e1607", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:35:44+00:00"}
