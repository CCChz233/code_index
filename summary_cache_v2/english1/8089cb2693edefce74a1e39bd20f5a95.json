{"summary": "The module offers tools for assessing and using spoken language understanding models on the SLURP benchmark. It includes a component that gathers model predictions, updates evaluation metrics, and computes final scores, as well as a helper for parsing semantic annotations. Additionally, it provides functionality to load a pretrained SLU model, run inference on audio inputs to obtain intent and slot outputs, and optionally export the results for further analysis.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to efficiently evaluate and deploy speech intent‑slot models, streamlining performance measurement and inference pipelines for voice‑enabled applications.", "keywords": ["speech intent", "slot filling", "SLU", "evaluation", "inference", "audio processing", "benchmark", "metrics", "model loading", "result export"], "summary_hash": "8ffa74534421", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:58:25+00:00"}
