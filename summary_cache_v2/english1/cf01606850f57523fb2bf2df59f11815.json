{"summary": "A dataset class that reads tokenized text‑normalization data from tarred pickle files, using a JSON manifest to specify the total number of batches and file locations. It handles brace‑expanded path patterns, configurable shuffling, and provides scatter or replicate shard distribution strategies for multi‑process training, with length reported as the total token count.", "business_intent": "Facilitate efficient, scalable loading of large pre‑tokenized text‑normalization decoder datasets for deep‑learning model training, particularly in distributed environments.", "keywords": ["dataset", "tarred files", "tokenized text", "text normalization", "decoder", "distributed training", "shard strategy", "scatter", "replicate", "brace expansion", "WebDataset", "metadata", "shuffle", "batch count", "token count"], "summary_hash": "5adb5d872c92", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:58:12+00:00"}
