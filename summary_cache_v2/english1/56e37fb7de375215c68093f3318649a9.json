{"summary": "This script orchestrates the execution of multiple calibration analysis routines, aggregates their outputs, generates comparative visualizations, and packages the results for review. It parses command‑line options, discovers relevant calibration data files, invokes specialized analyses for cause‑of‑death, demographic, and health‑service interaction calibrations, creates plots of appointment usage versus simulated values, and bundles the artifacts into a zip archive.", "business_intent": "To provide a comprehensive, automated workflow that validates and visualizes model calibration across health outcomes and service utilization, enabling stakeholders to assess model fidelity and support data‑driven decision making.", "keywords": ["calibration", "analysis", "cause of death", "disability", "demography", "health service interaction", "appointment usage", "comparison", "visualization", "automation", "zip archive", "command line"], "summary_hash": "78ceb25637ee", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:57:07+00:00"}
