{"summary": "Provides the core abstractions and utilities for sending, receiving, and responding to typed input data between Prefect flow runs at runtime. It defines a base input model, automatic handling for generated inputs, and iterator helpers that support both synchronous and asynchronous consumption, enabling two-way communication and real-time data exchange across distributed workflow executions.", "business_intent": "Enable dynamic, type‑safe communication between separate workflow instances, allowing flows to exchange data on‑the‑fly, react to incoming information, and maintain continuous synchronization in microservice‑oriented or distributed systems.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "flow communication", "typed input", "runtime data exchange", "asynchronous iteration", "two‑way channel", "dynamic workflow", "real‑time interaction", "microservices", "data synchronization"], "summary_hash": "0e4bac763a4d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:25:10+00:00"}
