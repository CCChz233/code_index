{"summary": "The module defines neural network building blocks that perform upsampling of feature maps. It offers a learnable sub‑pixel upsampling block that expands channel dimensions with a convolution before rearranging them via pixel‑shuffle, as well as a versatile upsampling block that can use transposed convolutions, grouped transposed convolutions, standard torch interpolation, or sub‑pixel pixel‑shuffle, optionally preceded by a convolution to adjust channel size. The blocks support 1‑D, 2‑D, and 3‑D data.", "business_intent": "Enable developers of medical imaging deep‑learning models to increase spatial resolution of feature tensors efficiently and flexibly, supporting multiple upsampling strategies to suit different architectures and performance requirements.", "keywords": ["upsampling", "subpixel", "pixel shuffle", "transposed convolution", "grouped convolution", "interpolation", "torch.nn", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "neural network block", "scale factor", "1D", "2D", "3D"], "summary_hash": "e1f99185f5a6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:20:08+00:00"}
