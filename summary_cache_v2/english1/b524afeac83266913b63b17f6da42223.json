{"summary": "Encapsulates all mutable information about a training run, such as current epoch, update step count, logging and evaluation intervals, checkpoint frequency, batch size, token statistics, FLOPs, log records, best metric and checkpoint identifiers, as well as flags indicating process role in distributed settings and whether a hyper‑parameter search is active. The state can be persisted to and restored from JSON, allowing seamless checkpointing and callback interaction.", "business_intent": "Provides a single source of truth for training progress that can be saved, reloaded, and inspected by callbacks, enabling robust checkpoint management, progress monitoring, and coordination across distributed or hyper‑parameter search workflows.", "keywords": ["trainer state", "checkpointing", "epoch tracking", "global step", "logging interval", "evaluation interval", "save interval", "batch size", "token count", "FLOPs", "best metric", "distributed process flags", "hyperparameter search", "JSON serialization"], "summary_hash": "c4f13e79019d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:24:05+00:00"}
