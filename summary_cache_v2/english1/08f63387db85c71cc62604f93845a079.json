{"summary": "The module implements a diffusion‑based monocular depth estimation pipeline. It defines a data container for depth results, handles image preprocessing, runs a conditional UNet together with a variational auto‑encoder and a scheduler, incorporates CLIP text encoding, and provides optional post‑processing such as colorization, resizing and uncertainty estimation via ensembling.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to obtain high‑quality dense depth maps from single RGB images for applications like 3D reconstruction, augmented reality, robotics, and visual analytics, while offering a simple, reusable interface built on popular deep‑learning libraries.", "keywords": ["depth estimation", "diffusion model", "monocular", "UNet", "VAE", "scheduler", "CLIP", "image preprocessing", "PyTorch", "visualization", "uncertainty", "ensembling", "colorization"], "summary_hash": "92e5bf5f959f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:01:12+00:00"}
