{"summary": "This module implements a strategy that integrates the DeepSpeed library with Lightning Fabric. It defines a class that manages the lifecycle of a DeepSpeed engine, handling model and optimizer wrapping, device placement, precision configuration, checkpoint I/O, and interaction with the underlying accelerator and cluster environment. Helper utilities assist with formatting DeepSpeed configuration, extracting engine state, and validating checkpoints.", "business_intent": "Provide Lightning Fabric users a ready‑to‑use strategy for scaling PyTorch training with DeepSpeed, simplifying mixed‑precision, optimizer sharding, and checkpoint handling while ensuring seamless operation within the Lightning ecosystem.", "keywords": ["DeepSpeed", "strategy", "distributed training", "mixed precision", "checkpointing", "accelerator", "GPU", "optimizer", "model wrapping", "sharding", "Lightning Fabric", "cluster environment", "configuration"], "summary_hash": "b264dfe36f49", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:02:12+00:00"}
