{"summary": "A comprehensive test suite for the Kandinsky diffusion pipelines, including text‑to‑image, image‑to‑image, inpainting, and prior models. The tests combine lightweight mock components for fast unit execution with real model components for full integration checks, covering initialization, input validation, output format and quality, deterministic results, precision handling, batch versus single inference parity, resource offloading, attention slicing, and model serialization.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness, stability, and performance of Kandinsky diffusion pipelines in the library, enabling rapid development, regression detection, and confidence for downstream users and applications that rely on image generation capabilities.", "keywords": ["Kandinsky", "diffusion", "pipeline", "unit tests", "integration tests", "image generation", "text-to-image", "image-to-image", "inpainting", "prior", "mock components", "resource offloading", "deterministic", "half‑precision", "batch inference", "model save/load", "attention slicing"], "summary_hash": "4ccb780c2c76", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:36:01+00:00"}
