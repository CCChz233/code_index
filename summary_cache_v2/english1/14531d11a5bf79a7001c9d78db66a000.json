{"summary": "The test suite validates the core check infrastructure of the security scanning framework, covering the BaseCheck component's behavior, its registration system, and the parsing and registration of graph‑based security checks. It ensures proper error logging, state reset after execution, correct method signatures, accurate retrieval of checks by exact and wildcard IDs, and successful loading of both built‑in and external check definitions.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability and correctness of the framework's check mechanisms so that security checks are defined, registered, and loaded without errors, preventing regressions and supporting extensibility for custom checks.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "BaseCheck", "registry", "graph checks", "security scanning", "error handling", "state reset", "method signatures", "wildcard ID matching", "check loading", "built‑in checks", "custom checks"], "summary_hash": "754e33a479cd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:25:45+00:00"}
