{"summary": "A wrapper module that flattens an n‑dimensional tensor by merging all dimensions except the last into a single batch dimension, feeds the resulting 2‑D tensor through a provided sub‑module, and then reshapes the output back to the original leading dimensions with an updated last dimension.", "business_intent": "Allows developers to reuse existing 2‑D neural network components (e.g., linear layers, classifiers) on higher‑dimensional data without manual reshaping, simplifying model construction for tasks where the same operation must be applied across arbitrary leading dimensions.", "keywords": ["tensor reshaping", "dimensionality reduction", "wrapper module", "PyTorch", "apply module over last dimension", "batch flattening", "flexible output size"], "summary_hash": "9c1fefab7b87", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:24:48+00:00"}
