{"summary": "A configuration container that encapsulates all architectural and training hyper‑parameters for a StableLM transformer model, such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention head configuration, activation function, positional embedding limits, initialization scale, normalization epsilon, cache usage, embedding tying, RoPE base and scaling options, bias flags, and dropout rates. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration base, allowing seamless model construction and checkpoint compatibility.", "business_intent": "Provides developers and researchers a single, editable object to define or modify the structure and behavior of a StableLM model before instantiation, facilitating reproducible model creation, fine‑tuning, and experimentation with different architectural choices.", "keywords": ["stablelm", "configuration", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "rotary embeddings", "rope scaling", "dropout", "bias", "cache", "embedding tie", "pretrainedconfig"], "summary_hash": "db94dde7f5c5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:24:48+00:00"}
