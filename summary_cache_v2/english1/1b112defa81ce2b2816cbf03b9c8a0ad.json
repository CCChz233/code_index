{"summary": "A dataset class that reads a manifest of video file paths and associated transcripts, optionally preprocesses the text, filters entries based on video duration, and returns tensors ready for model consumption. It supports integer encoding, silence trimming, insertion of BOS/EOS tokens, padding, optional sample‑ID return, and channel selection for multi‑channel audio.", "business_intent": "Facilitate efficient loading and preprocessing of paired video‑text data for training multimodal or speech‑to‑text machine‑learning models.", "keywords": ["video", "text", "manifest", "dataset", "duration filtering", "preprocessing", "tokenization", "padding", "BOS/EOS", "silence trimming", "channel selection", "collate function", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "15b2afa6a40c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:48:54+00:00"}
