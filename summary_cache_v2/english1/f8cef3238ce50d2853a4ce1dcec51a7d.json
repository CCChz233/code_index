{"summary": "The class prepares a dataset for joint multi‑label intent detection and slot filling using a pretrained language model. It reads sentence‑label pairs and corresponding slot label files, tokenizes the text, applies optional lower‑casing, truncates or pads sequences to a fixed length, and generates masks to handle extra or special tokens. It also supports sampling a subset of data for quick testing.", "business_intent": "Enable training and evaluation of conversational AI models that need to recognize multiple user intents simultaneously while extracting entity slots, improving virtual assistants, chatbots, and voice interfaces.", "keywords": ["multi-label intent classification", "slot filling", "dataset preprocessing", "tokenization", "sequence padding", "NLP", "pretrained models", "data loading", "conversation AI"], "summary_hash": "5b79e929a098", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:59:25+00:00"}
