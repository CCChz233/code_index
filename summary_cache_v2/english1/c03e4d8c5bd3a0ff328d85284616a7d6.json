{"summary": "This module implements a suite of unit tests for the collision‑length functions in the Plasmapy formulary, covering impact‑parameter, perpendicular impact‑parameter, and mean‑free‑path calculations. The tests verify correct numerical results for both scalar and array inputs, check symmetry properties, compare against known reference values, and confirm appropriate warning and error handling.", "business_intent": "Ensure the accuracy and robustness of plasma collision length computations in the Plasmapy library by providing automated regression testing that validates scientific results and catches implementation issues.", "keywords": ["plasma physics", "collision length", "impact parameter", "mean free path", "unit testing", "NumPy", "Astropy units", "validation", "symmetry", "reference values", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "6311af39a801", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:09:50+00:00"}
