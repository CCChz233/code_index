{"summary": "Implements a 3D deep neural network that fuses a ResNet backbone, a feature pyramid, an attention module, and an ASPP block to perform prostate segmentation on transrectal ultrasound volumes. The model produces multiple supervised outputs (single‑layer features, attentive features, final prediction) and can optionally return all intermediate maps for visual analysis.", "business_intent": "Provide an automated, high‑accuracy solution for prostate segmentation in 3D ultrasound to support clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, while offering visual insight into the network's internal processing.", "keywords": ["3D CNN", "Feature Pyramid Network", "Attention Module", "ASPP", "Prostate Segmentation", "Transrectal Ultrasound", "Medical Imaging", "Multi‑scale Supervision", "Deep Learning"], "summary_hash": "fc0ae62bebb0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:37:41+00:00"}
