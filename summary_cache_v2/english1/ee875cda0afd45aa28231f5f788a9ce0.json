{"summary": "BitsetArray implements a pandas‑compatible ExtensionArray that stores each element as a fixed‑width byte string encoding a set of bits. It presents each element as a Python set and supports set arithmetic (union, intersection, difference, subset/superset checks) on individual items, slices, or boolean masks, handling conversion between the compact binary representation and set objects while managing dtype casting and copying.", "business_intent": "Provide a memory‑efficient, pandas‑friendly container for large collections of bitsets, enabling users to manipulate them with familiar set semantics while keeping storage overhead low.", "keywords": ["bitset", "bytestring", "set operations", "pandas", "ExtensionArray", "compact storage", "union", "intersection", "difference", "subset", "superset", "dtype", "copy", "take", "nbytes"], "summary_hash": "2d4c80340889", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:51:46+00:00"}
