{"summary": "The module provides an end‑to‑end example for customizing Stable Diffusion 3 using DreamBooth with LoRA adapters. It defines dataset utilities for loading instance and class images together with their prompts, handles image preprocessing, tokenization, model and text‑encoder loading, and orchestrates the training loop with distributed acceleration, checkpointing, and optional validation.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and artists to efficiently personalize large text‑to‑image diffusion models on their own visual concepts, reducing computational cost through low‑rank adaptation while maintaining high generation quality.", "keywords": ["DreamBooth", "LoRA", "Stable Diffusion 3", "fine‑tuning", "diffusion model", "custom subject generation", "image preprocessing", "text tokenization", "distributed training", "checkpointing", "validation", "Hugging Face", "model card"], "summary_hash": "21bd1ef7d4d0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:05:10+00:00"}
