{"summary": "Implements the W‑Transducer loss, a modified RNN‑Transducer loss that tolerates missing text at the start or end of an utterance. The class encapsulates grid and schema data needed for loss computation and provides a forward helper to calculate the loss while keeping compatibility with standard RNN‑T decoding.", "business_intent": "Enable training of speech recognition models using RNN‑Transducer architecture on datasets where transcript boundaries may be incomplete, improving robustness and reducing preprocessing constraints without altering the inference pipeline.", "keywords": ["RNN-Transducer", "W-Transducer loss", "speech recognition", "missing tokens", "training loss", "grid", "temporal schema", "unit schema", "robustness"], "summary_hash": "96d816ab6e67", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:25:33+00:00"}
