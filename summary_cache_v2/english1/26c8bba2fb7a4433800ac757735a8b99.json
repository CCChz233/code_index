{"summary": "This module implements a Home Assistant camera platform that acts as a proxy for another camera entity. It defines configuration options for image caching, resizing, quality, and refresh rates, encapsulates those options in a lightweight object, and provides a proxy camera class that forwards image and stream requests to the underlying camera while applying the configured processing steps. An async setup helper registers the platform with Home Assistant.", "business_intent": "Allow Home Assistant users to expose a camera through a proxy that can modify and optimize the image data—such as resizing, adjusting quality, and caching—before it is served to other components or clients, facilitating flexible integration of existing cameras with custom processing requirements.", "keywords": ["camera", "proxy", "image processing", "resize", "quality", "caching", "Home Assistant", "async", "platform", "configuration", "streaming"], "summary_hash": "4c1f6b7d3520", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:31:15+00:00"}
