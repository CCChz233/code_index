{"summary": "The module defines dataset classes for information-retrieval tasks. It implements a base class that prepares query-passage pairs, handling tokenization, length constraints, and loading data from common formats. A derived class specializes this for BERT-based retrieval, managing indexing, length reporting, and conversion of raw queries into segmented passages suitable for model input.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient preparation and feeding of query-passage data to NLP retrieval models, particularly BERT, to support training, validation, and inference pipelines in information-retrieval applications.", "keywords": ["information retrieval", "dataset", "query", "passage", "tokenization", "BERT", "NLP", "PyTorch", "length limit", "data loading", "multiprocessing"], "summary_hash": "c18a864b7b61", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:28:47+00:00"}
