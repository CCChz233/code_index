{"summary": "The class converts a collection of points, or a batch of equally sized point sets, into a graph where each node represents a point and edges connect each node to its k‑nearest neighbors (including itself). It computes pairwise distances, selects the closest k points for each node, and assembles the resulting adjacency structure, handling batch indexing to produce a unified graph.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream graph‑based learning models, such as graph neural networks, to operate on raw geometric or feature data by providing an efficient k‑nearest‑neighbor graph representation, supporting both single and batched inputs for scalable processing.", "keywords": ["k-nearest neighbors", "graph construction", "point set", "batch processing", "distance matrix", "adjacency", "graph neural networks", "DGL", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "d02bf8866821", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:51:28+00:00"}
