{"summary": "The module implements utilities for constructing image classification datasets from a directory hierarchy. It defines a generic folder dataset container and a concrete ImageFolder class that scans a root folder, maps subdirectory names to numeric class IDs, builds a list of image file paths with corresponding labels, and supports optional image and target transformations during retrieval. Helper functions handle image loading (via PIL), file‑extension checks, and dataset creation.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless loading and preprocessing of image datasets organized by class subfolders for training and evaluating vision models within the NeMo Megatron framework.", "keywords": ["image dataset", "folder structure", "class labels", "data loading", "image transformations", "PIL", "vision dataset", "deep learning", "NeMo", "Megatron"], "summary_hash": "a47f3437a3ad", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:19:20+00:00"}
