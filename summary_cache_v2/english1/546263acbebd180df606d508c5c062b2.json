{"summary": "The module defines a DiagMatrix class that represents a diagonal matrix using a compact torch tensor. It offers methods for device placement, dtype casting, shape queries, conversion to dense or COO sparse formats, and basic linear‑algebra utilities such as transpose, while also providing placeholder utilities for creating diagonal or identity matrices.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient storage and manipulation of diagonal matrices within DGL's sparse matrix ecosystem, supporting common operations and seamless integration with PyTorch tensors.", "keywords": ["diagonal matrix", "sparse representation", "DGL", "torch tensor", "device management", "dtype casting", "dense conversion", "COO format", "transpose", "identity matrix"], "summary_hash": "493004b8bd67", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:37:11+00:00"}
