{"summary": "This module adds support for OpenAI's audio-capable models (such as GPT‑4o audio) within the litellm framework. It defines a configuration class that translates user‑provided arguments into the format required by OpenAI's audio endpoints, exposes the relevant settings, and checks that the selected model belongs to the audio family.", "business_intent": "Enable applications to generate or process audio (e.g., speech synthesis or transcription) using OpenAI's audio models through a unified litellm interface, simplifying model selection and parameter handling for developers.", "keywords": ["OpenAI", "audio models", "GPT-4o", "configuration", "parameter mapping", "model validation", "litellm", "speech synthesis", "speech transcription"], "summary_hash": "872ecc98924c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:56:54+00:00"}
