{"summary": "Provides a collection of concurrency utilities that bridge asynchronous FastAPI/Starlette code with synchronous execution. It includes helpers to run functions in a thread pool, iterate over iterables in a thread pool, wait for the first of multiple async tasks to complete, and a context manager for managing thread‑pool resources.", "business_intent": "Enable safe execution of blocking or CPU‑bound operations within an async web framework used by Prefect, preventing event‑loop blockage and allowing controlled use of thread‑pool resources.", "keywords": ["concurrency", "asyncio", "thread pool", "run_in_threadpool", "iterate_in_threadpool", "run_until_first_complete", "context manager", "capacity limiter", "FastAPI", "Prefect", "Starlette"], "summary_hash": "fada49e86a43", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:37:06+00:00"}
