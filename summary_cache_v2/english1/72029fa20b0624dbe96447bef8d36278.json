{"summary": "The module defines a data structure that wraps a quantum operation together with optional annotations, exposing its identifier, qubit and classical bit dimensions, and providing methods to generate controlled, inverted, powered, or copied variants as well as matrix representations. It also defines a hierarchy of modifier classes that describe how an operation should be altered (e.g., adding control qubits, inverting, raising to a power).", "business_intent": "Enable flexible manipulation and representation of quantum circuit operations within Qiskit, supporting advanced features such as controlled gates, inverses, and exponentiation while preserving metadata for circuit construction, optimization, and simulation.", "keywords": ["quantum operation", "annotation", "controlled gate", "inverse", "power", "modifier", "circuit transformation", "Qiskit", "gate matrix", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "c27e3b5c9d7f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:53:30+00:00"}
