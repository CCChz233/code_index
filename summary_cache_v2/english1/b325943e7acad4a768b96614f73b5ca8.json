{"summary": "Implements a transpilation pass that detects reset operations occurring after measurements and replaces them with a conditional X gate, matching the IBM Quantum hardware implementation where reset is realized as measurement followed by a conditional X. The pass applies only when this backend behavior is appropriate, leaving circuits unchanged on other platforms.", "business_intent": "Enhance quantum circuit execution on IBM Quantum devices by simplifying reset-after-measure patterns, reducing gate overhead and aligning circuit semantics with the backend's native reset implementation to improve performance and fidelity.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit optimization", "reset after measurement", "conditional X gate", "IBM Quantum", "transpilation pass", "backend-specific transformation", "circuit simplification"], "summary_hash": "50fd428fb617", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:42:16+00:00"}
