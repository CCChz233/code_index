{"summary": "Implements a full Stable Diffusion XL pipeline that transforms textual prompts into images. It orchestrates a VAE, two CLIP text encoders, tokenizers, a conditional UNet, and a scheduler to encode prompts, generate latent representations, perform denoising with classifier‑free guidance, and decode the result. The class also supports loading and saving LoRA weights, textual inversion embeddings, and IP‑Adapter modules, and can optionally embed an invisible watermark in the output.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to generate high‑quality AI images from text quickly and flexibly, with support for model fine‑tuning extensions and watermarking for commercial use.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "Stable Diffusion XL", "diffusion pipeline", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "classifier-free guidance", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "IP‑Adapter", "watermark", "AI art"], "summary_hash": "8432941b789c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:16:24+00:00"}
