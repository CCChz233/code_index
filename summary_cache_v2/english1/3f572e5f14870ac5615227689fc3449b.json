{"summary": "ParallelRunner orchestrates the execution of a data processing pipeline by dividing its nodes into independent groups based on topological ordering and running each group concurrently. It ensures that datasets marked as single‑process are not used in parallel runs and manages the required worker resources.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, reliable processing of complex pipelines by leveraging parallelism while preserving data integrity and respecting dataset execution constraints.", "keywords": ["parallel execution", "pipeline orchestration", "topological sorting", "dataset validation", "worker allocation", "concurrency", "data integrity", "executor management", "abstract runner implementation"], "summary_hash": "6f940e5e6e33", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:04:38+00:00"}
