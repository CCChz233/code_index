{"summary": "Implements per-sample stochastic depth (drop path) regularization for residual connections, typically used in Swin Transformer blocks. During the forward pass it randomly drops whole residual branches based on a configured probability and rescales the surviving paths to keep the expected output unchanged.", "business_intent": "Provide a lightweight regularization technique that improves generalization and training stability of deep vision models by randomly bypassing residual paths for each sample, thereby reducing overfitting and computational load.", "keywords": ["stochastic depth", "drop path", "residual block", "regularization", "deep learning", "Swin Transformer", "per-sample dropout", "neural network", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "71b34de1eb02", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:32:24+00:00"}
