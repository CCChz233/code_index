{"summary": "A configuration container for Vision Transformer (ViT) models that encapsulates all architectural hyperparameters such as hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, feed‑forward size, activation, dropout rates, initialization scale, layer‑norm epsilon, image and patch dimensions, channel count, QKV bias flag, and encoder stride. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate a ViT model with a specific architecture or to replicate a known pretrained setup.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to easily define, modify, and reproduce ViT model architectures by adjusting a single configuration object, facilitating model creation, fine‑tuning, and integration with pretrained weights.", "keywords": ["Vision Transformer", "ViT", "model configuration", "hyperparameters", "encoder layers", "attention heads", "patch size", "image size", "dropout", "initializer", "layer normalization", "QKV bias", "encoder stride", "pretrained config"], "summary_hash": "8b5ddaf74767", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:49:58+00:00"}
