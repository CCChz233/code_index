{"summary": "An example script that demonstrates how to fine‑tune a causal language model with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to generate concise TL;DR summaries. It loads a text dataset, tokenizes it, sets up a reward model for sequence classification, configures PPO training parameters, and runs a reinforcement‑learning loop that samples continuations, evaluates them with the reward model, and updates the policy model.", "business_intent": "Showcase the use of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for summarization tasks, providing developers with a ready‑to‑run reference for applying PPO to improve text generation quality in production or research pipelines.", "keywords": ["PPO", "reinforcement learning", "summarization", "TLDR", "TRL", "Hugging Face", "causal language model", "reward model", "tokenization", "training loop"], "summary_hash": "b928433340ed", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:02:42+00:00"}
