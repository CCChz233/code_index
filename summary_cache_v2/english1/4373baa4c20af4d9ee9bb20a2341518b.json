{"summary": "A configuration container that holds all architectural and training hyper‑parameters for a Pegasus‑X transformer model, such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, numbers of encoder/decoder layers, attention heads, feed‑forward sizes, dropout rates, position limits, layer‑drop probabilities, caching options and special token settings. The object is passed to the model constructor to create a Pegasus‑X instance with the desired structure.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to easily specify, share and reproduce the exact Pegasus‑X model architecture and training settings required for tasks like summarization or generation, enabling consistent model initialization and fine‑tuning across projects.", "keywords": ["PegasusX", "configuration", "transformer", "encoder", "decoder", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "dropout", "position embeddings", "layerdrop", "cache", "global tokens", "block size", "staggered local attention", "activation function"], "summary_hash": "07bfc95009ed", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:12:21+00:00"}
