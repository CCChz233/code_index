{"summary": "The module provides a suite of unit and integration tests for a Stable Diffusion pipeline that incorporates Prompt Attention Guidance (PAG). It uses lightweight dummy components for fast validation and the full pipeline for comprehensive checks, covering both classifier‑free guidance and unconditional generation paths, while ensuring deterministic execution on GPU.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and stability of the PAG‑enhanced diffusion pipeline to guarantee reliable image generation functionality before deployment.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion", "Prompt Attention Guidance", "testing", "unit tests", "integration tests", "dummy components", "CFG", "unconditional generation", "PyTorch", "diffusers"], "summary_hash": "d8d9ae64ffe8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:49:00+00:00"}
