{"summary": "The module defines a comprehensive suite of unit tests that validate the implementation of classical plasma transport coefficient calculations based on the Braginskii model. It checks nondimensional resistivity, electron and ion thermal conductivity, thermoelectric conductivity, viscosity, and related quantities across different magnetic field regimes (cross‑field, parallel, unmagnetized) and ensures correct model selection, unit handling, and error reporting.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the scientific accuracy and robustness of plasma transport property functions, thereby supporting reliable plasma physics research and engineering applications that depend on precise calculations of resistivity, conductivity, viscosity, and related transport phenomena.", "keywords": ["plasma", "transport coefficients", "Braginskii model", "resistivity", "thermal conductivity", "viscosity", "unit testing", "validation", "magnetized plasma", "unmagnetized plasma", "Hall parameter", "Coulomb logarithm"], "summary_hash": "a1aaa94edbfd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:08:48+00:00"}
