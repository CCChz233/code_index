{"summary": "Creates a parameterized quantum circuit that conserves the total number of excitations by applying layers of single-qubit Z rotations followed by two-qubit XX+YY interactions (or FSIM/iswap gates). The circuit structure, number of repetitions, entanglement pattern, and optional phase gate are configurable, yielding a compact excitation‑preserving variational ansatz.", "business_intent": "Provides a lightweight, excitation‑conserving variational form for quantum algorithms such as VQE or quantum chemistry simulations, enabling efficient exploration of states with fixed particle number while avoiding the complexity of full UCC ansatzes.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "variational ansatz", "excitation preserving", "particle number conservation", "RZ rotation", "RXX", "RYY", "FSIM", "iswap", "entanglement pattern", "VQE", "quantum chemistry"], "summary_hash": "0ba12673ec78", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:28:59+00:00"}
