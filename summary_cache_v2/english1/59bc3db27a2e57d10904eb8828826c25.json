{"summary": "The module generates LALR(1) parsing tables by analyzing grammar rules, constructing states, and mapping actions (shift, reduce, accept) to those states. It includes data structures for actions, integer‑based lookup tables, and generic parse‑table handling, automatically resolving shift/reduce conflicts in favor of shifts.", "business_intent": "To provide the core LALR(1) table‑construction logic required by the Lark parsing framework, enabling fast and reliable syntax analysis for user‑defined grammars in applications such as compilers, interpreters, and data format validators.", "keywords": ["LALR", "parse table", "shift/reduce conflict", "grammar analysis", "parser generator", "syntax analysis", "LR(0) items", "state machine", "compiler", "interpreter"], "summary_hash": "3d8596e52fd8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:47:16+00:00"}
