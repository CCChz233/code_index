{"summary": "Implements a modular block for hybrid Vision Transformer architectures, encapsulating token mixing and feed‑forward operations. The class sets up the necessary sub‑layers during initialization and provides a forward computation that processes input tensors through these components.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable building block that combines convolutional and transformer‑style processing to simplify the creation of efficient hybrid vision models for image recognition and related computer‑vision tasks.", "keywords": ["Vision Transformer", "Hybrid layer", "Block", "token mixing", "feed-forward", "timm", "neural network", "image recognition", "modular architecture"], "summary_hash": "c0853bab9eb7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:23:28+00:00"}
