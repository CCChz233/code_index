{"summary": "The module provides a collection of migration utilities that automatically transform checkpoint dictionaries saved with older Lightning releases into the format expected by the current version. It defines individual migration functions for specific structural changes (e.g., loop state, callback configurations) and registers them in a version-indexed map that is applied sequentially when a checkpoint is loaded.", "business_intent": "To maintain backward compatibility for Lightning users by allowing seamless loading of legacy checkpoints after framework upgrades, thereby preserving training progress and avoiding manual checkpoint conversion.", "keywords": ["migration", "checkpoint", "backward compatibility", "version upgrade", "state transformation", "Lightning", "loop structure", "early stopping", "model checkpoint", "warning"], "summary_hash": "d3da73f4dcd8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:01:17+00:00"}
