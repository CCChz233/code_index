{"summary": "The module implements a VariableDensityFlow class that encapsulates all settings and algorithms required to simulate groundwater flow with spatially varying fluid density. It manages density derivation from solute concentrations or user‑specified values, enforces density limits, integrates with solute transport, controls convergence, optionally corrects the water‑table, and supports different internodal density averaging schemes.", "business_intent": "Enable hydrogeologists and environmental engineers to perform coupled flow‑transport simulations where density variations affect groundwater movement, improving the accuracy of water‑table and contaminant predictions in variable‑density conditions.", "keywords": ["variable density flow", "groundwater simulation", "solute transport coupling", "density calculation", "convergence control", "water table correction", "internodal averaging", "hydrogeology", "environmental modeling"], "summary_hash": "7fa176a5ed71", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:46:45+00:00"}
