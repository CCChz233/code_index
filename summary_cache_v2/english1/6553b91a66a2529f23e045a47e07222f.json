{"summary": "This module implements internal utilities for reading MPAS mesh files and translating their data structures into the UGRID format used by the uxarray library. It contains parsers for global attributes, node, edge, and face information—including coordinates, connectivity, and distances—as well as helper routines for index conversion and handling of padded or missing values.", "business_intent": "Provide the capability to ingest and convert MPAS unstructured mesh datasets into a standardized UGRID representation, enabling downstream analysis and visualization of climate and ocean model data within the uxarray ecosystem.", "keywords": ["MPAS", "UGRID", "mesh conversion", "unstructured grid", "parsing", "coordinates", "connectivity", "attributes", "zero-index conversion", "padding handling", "xarray"], "summary_hash": "5008dffcf07e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:29:48+00:00"}
