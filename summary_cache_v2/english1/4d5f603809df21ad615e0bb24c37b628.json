{"summary": "A dictionary‑based transform that extracts a spatial region of interest from ND channel‑first data, handling cases where the requested crop exceeds image dimensions and supporting multiple ways to define the crop (slices, center‑size, start‑end). It integrates with MONAI’s lazy execution framework.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and efficient ROI extraction during medical imaging preprocessing, ensuring compatibility with downstream models and pipelines.", "keywords": ["crop", "region of interest", "spatial transform", "ND data", "lazy execution", "dictionary wrapper", "MONAI", "image preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "6863ed4bd1a6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:04:16+00:00"}
