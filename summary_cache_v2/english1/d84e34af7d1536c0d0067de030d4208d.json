{"summary": "The module implements a collection of data processor utilities for the GLUE benchmark, converting raw task files into structured examples suitable for sequence classification models. It defines a generic example container and specialized processors for each GLUE task, handling loading, parsing, label conversion, train/dev/test split extraction, and optional generation of T5‑style prompts.", "business_intent": "Enable rapid preparation and standardized formatting of GLUE benchmark datasets for training, fine‑tuning, and evaluating natural language processing models within the NeMo ecosystem.", "keywords": ["GLUE", "data processing", "NLP", "dataset loading", "train/dev/test splits", "label mapping", "T5 prompts", "NeMo", "sequence classification", "benchmark utilities"], "summary_hash": "82f17b2fefda", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:27:17+00:00"}
