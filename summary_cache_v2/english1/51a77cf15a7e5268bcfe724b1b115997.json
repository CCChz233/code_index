{"summary": "The class implements a tokenizer for the Whisper speech‑to‑text model, handling special tokens such as start‑of‑sequence, end‑of‑sequence, padding, language and task identifiers, and optional timestamp handling. It provides methods for normalizing text, applying byte‑pair encoding, converting between token IDs and strings, building inputs with special tokens, and decoding model outputs with or without timestamps.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate preprocessing and post‑processing of audio transcription data for multilingual speech recognition and translation tasks using the Whisper model.", "keywords": ["Whisper", "tokenizer", "speech recognition", "speech translation", "multilingual", "timestamp", "special tokens", "BPE", "text normalization", "decoder prompt"], "summary_hash": "3f2f2f645cb6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:54:25+00:00"}
