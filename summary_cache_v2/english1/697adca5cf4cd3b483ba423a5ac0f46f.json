{"summary": "The module implements a collection of pulse‑schedule transformation utilities that take Qiskit Pulse schedules or instruction objects and produce new, canonicalized schedules. Functions handle tasks such as inlining sub‑routines, adding implicit acquire operations, aligning measurement instructions, flattening nested schedule blocks, compressing consecutive pulses, padding schedules, and stripping redundant directives or trivial barriers.", "business_intent": "Provide a standardized, hardware‑ready representation of quantum pulse programs by automatically adjusting timing, resource acquisition, and instruction ordering, thereby simplifying schedule preparation and improving compatibility with quantum back‑ends.", "keywords": ["pulse", "schedule", "canonicalization", "rescheduling", "inline subroutines", "acquire alignment", "measurement alignment", "flatten", "compress pulses", "padding", "remove directives", "remove barriers", "quantum control"], "summary_hash": "141fc142cd0c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:04:32+00:00"}
