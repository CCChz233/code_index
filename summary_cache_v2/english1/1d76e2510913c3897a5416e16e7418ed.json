{"summary": "The module supplies a collection of standalone scripts that execute load‑testing scenarios against the Litellm Router. They configure necessary environment variables, optionally enable caching (including S3‑backed cache), generate a high volume of completion requests—both synchronously via an OpenAI client and asynchronously—track response times, error rates, and success ratios, and finally output performance statistics.", "business_intent": "To benchmark and validate the scalability, latency, and reliability of the Litellm Router under heavy traffic, helping developers and operators assess system capacity, identify bottlenecks, and fine‑tune caching or deployment configurations before production use.", "keywords": ["load testing", "Litellm Router", "performance metrics", "latency measurement", "asynchronous requests", "OpenAI client", "caching", "S3 cache", "environment configuration", "scalability", "benchmarking"], "summary_hash": "d59e8face305", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:01:59+00:00"}
