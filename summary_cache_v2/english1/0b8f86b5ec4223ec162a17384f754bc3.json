{"summary": "This module defines unit tests that validate the behavior of MONAI's convolutional blocks and residual units for both 2‑D and 3‑D data. The tests cover a range of configurations such as activation functions, dilation rates, dropout, stride variations, and transposed convolutions to ensure these components operate correctly under diverse settings.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of core neural network building blocks used in medical imaging models, enabling reliable development and maintenance of deep learning pipelines within the MONAI framework.", "keywords": ["convolution", "residual unit", "2D", "3D", "unit testing", "MONAI", "activation", "dilation", "dropout", "stride", "transposed convolution", "medical imaging", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "8bf1103c572c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:39:43+00:00"}
