{"summary": "The module runs a lightweight simulation that only processes contraceptive choice and age‑update events to generate an approximate age‑time profile of contraceptive use. It then derives implied age‑specific fertility rates from these usage patterns, compares them with World Population Prospects fertility estimates, and provides simple utilities for formatting results, extracting the implied ASFR, and visualising the comparison.", "business_intent": "To give modelers a fast, low‑overhead way to validate and calibrate the contraceptive component of a demographic simulation by checking that simulated contraceptive use yields realistic fertility outcomes before committing to a full‑scale run.", "keywords": ["contraception", "simulation", "calibration", "fertility rates", "age‑specific fertility", "ASFR", "quick check", "plotting", "demographic modeling", "WPP comparison"], "summary_hash": "47b2b0d937d4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:53:15+00:00"}
