{"summary": "This module implements a set of iterator utilities that merge multiple data iterables into a single, configurable combined loader. It offers different sampling strategies (e.g., maximum size, minimum size, cyclic, sequential) and supplies length reporting, state serialization, reset capabilities, and worker shutdown handling, all integrated with Lightning's stateful infrastructure.", "business_intent": "Enable Lightning users to combine several data loaders with flexible sampling policies while maintaining checkpoint‑compatible iteration, simplifying multi‑dataset training and evaluation pipelines.", "keywords": ["combined loader", "iterator", "sampling strategy", "PyTorch Lightning", "data loading", "multi-dataloader", "state management", "reset", "cyclic iterator", "sequential iterator", "length calculation", "checkpointing"], "summary_hash": "ba2ff2f8fb4f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:54:23+00:00"}
