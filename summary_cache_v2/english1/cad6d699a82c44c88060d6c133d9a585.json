{"summary": "Defines a set of benchmark scenarios for memory‑efficient attention kernels, including utilities to generate input tensors and execute forward and backward passes for various attention implementations. It aggregates shape configurations for language‑model and vision workloads, and provides a command‑line entry point to run the benchmarks, though it is currently not invoked elsewhere.", "business_intent": "Measure and compare the performance and memory footprint of different attention operators across typical model sizes, enabling developers to select or optimize the most efficient implementation for large‑scale transformer workloads.", "keywords": ["benchmark", "memory efficient attention", "performance", "forward pass", "backward pass", "tensor generation", "shape configurations", "LLM", "vision", "xformers", "FMHA", "attention bias", "torch"], "summary_hash": "69d049723bbe", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:28:35+00:00"}
