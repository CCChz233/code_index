{"summary": "This module bundles reusable component classes that model shared elements of an Amazon States Language (ASL) definition—such as user comments, parameter sets, result‑selector specifications, and version metadata. Each class offers structured access, serialization support, and evaluation against an execution environment to aid the Step Functions parser in interpreting and preparing state machine definitions.", "business_intent": "Enable the Moto Step Functions service to correctly parse, validate, and materialize common ASL constructs, providing the necessary logic for handling comments, parameters, result selectors, and version information during definition processing and execution.", "keywords": ["Amazon States Language", "ASL", "Step Functions", "parser", "comment component", "parameters component", "result selector", "version metadata", "payload template", "evaluation", "execution environment", "serialization", "common components"], "summary_hash": "fa229c5a8d7e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:59:30+00:00"}
