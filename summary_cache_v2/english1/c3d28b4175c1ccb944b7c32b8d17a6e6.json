{"summary": "Provides a PyTorch neural network layer that performs graph attention convolution using dot‑product similarity of linearly transformed node features. It computes attention coefficients via edge softmax, aggregates neighbor information, and supports multi‑head attention for both homogeneous and unidirectional bipartite graphs.", "business_intent": "Facilitates building graph neural network models that leverage attention mechanisms to learn richer node embeddings, improving performance on graph‑based machine learning tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph representation learning.", "keywords": ["graph attention", "dot product", "convolution", "PyTorch", "DGL", "multi‑head", "bipartite graph", "edge softmax", "neural network layer", "graph neural network"], "summary_hash": "ac3654f55beb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:44:59+00:00"}
