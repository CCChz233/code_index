It validates Metaflow flow constraints, resolves DAG naming and authentication tokens, traverses the flow graph, and generates Airflow DAG definitions that can be executed by Airflow. It also includes helpers for handling AWS Step Functions tokens and Kubernetes decorators.", "business_intent": "Allow Metaflow users to deploy their data science workflows as Airflow DAGs, ensuring compatibility and providing tooling for token management and environment integration.", "keywords": ["Metaflow", "Airflow", "CLI", "DAG generation", "workflow validation", "token resolution", "AWS Step Functions", "Kubernetes", "decorators", "graph traversal"], "summary_hash": "8eabc50c8506", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:10:30+00:00"}
