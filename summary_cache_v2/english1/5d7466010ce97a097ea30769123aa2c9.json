{"summary": "This module centralizes Prefect workflow state handling. It provides a StateGroup class that can collect multiple state objects, evaluate collective status (e.g., completed, final), and count occurrences of each state type. It also offers a suite of convenience constructors for the various predefined state categories and utilities for extracting results, exceptions, and converting exceptions into appropriate state representations.", "business_intent": "To give the Prefect orchestration engine and users a consistent, high‑level interface for creating, inspecting, aggregating, and transforming execution states, enabling reliable status checks, result retrieval, and error handling across workflows.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "state management", "state aggregation", "status evaluation", "result extraction", "exception handling", "state helpers", "workflow orchestration"], "summary_hash": "555ed089063d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:24:35+00:00"}
