{"summary": "The class loads the QM9 molecular dataset, builds a DGL graph for each molecule where atoms are nodes and edges are created between atoms whose Euclidean distance is within a configurable cutoff. Node attributes include atomic numbers and 3‑D coordinates, while edge attributes are derived from distances. It supplies a configurable subset of the 12 quantum‑chemical regression targets as labels and exposes the number of prediction tasks.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to quickly obtain a standardized graph‑based representation of QM9 molecules for training and evaluating graph neural network models that predict quantum‑chemical properties such as dipole moment, HOMO/LUMO energies, and thermodynamic quantities.", "keywords": ["QM9", "molecular graph", "regression", "graph neural network", "DGL", "atomic coordinates", "atomic numbers", "distance cutoff", "property prediction", "quantum chemistry"], "summary_hash": "90181564a4b2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:44:26+00:00"}
