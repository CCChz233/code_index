{"summary": "A neural network module that forms the central processing stage of the CogVideoX architecture, applying a configurable stack of residual layers to 3‑D feature maps. It integrates time‑step embeddings, dropout, group or spatial normalization, and a swish activation to refine spatial‑temporal representations before passing them onward in the model.", "business_intent": "Provides a flexible and efficient building block for AI‑driven video synthesis and enhancement systems, supporting high‑quality content generation and manipulation in media creation platforms.", "keywords": ["video synthesis", "residual block", "3D convolution", "temporal embedding", "normalization", "activation", "dropout", "deep learning", "CogVideoX", "media AI"], "summary_hash": "5d00bbe05c52", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:36:17+00:00"}
