{"summary": "This module implements a scheduler tailored for diffusion models that work with vector‑quantized latent spaces. It defines a scheduler class that tracks diffusion timesteps, embedding class counts, and cumulative alpha and gamma curves, and provides methods to compute transition probabilities, posterior distributions, and update steps during the denoising process. Additionally, it includes lightweight data structures for step outputs and utility functions for generating alpha/gamma schedules, adding Gumbel noise, and converting indices to log‑one‑hot encodings.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient and configurable diffusion‑based generation in AI systems that use vector‑quantized representations, supporting tasks such as image synthesis, video generation, or other media creation pipelines that rely on discrete latent codes.", "keywords": ["diffusion scheduler", "vector quantization", "latent representation", "alpha schedule", "gamma schedule", "Gumbel noise", "one‑hot encoding", "denoising", "generative AI", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "ba3a2ec44ded", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:39:56+00:00"}
