{"summary": "The module implements a suite of health‑check utilities for xarray DataArray objects, offering classes and helper functions that detect missing or null entries, evaluate missing‑data percentages, enforce minimum counts of valid observations, and validate climate‑specific variables such as temperature and discharge against expected ranges and standards (including WMO identifiers). These tools are used to prepare and verify data quality before further climate analysis.", "business_intent": "To ensure the quality, completeness, and correctness of climate and hydrological datasets by automatically identifying and handling missing or out‑of‑range values, thereby supporting reliable downstream calculations and decision‑making.", "keywords": ["health checks", "data validation", "missing data detection", "xarray", "climate data quality", "temperature validation", "discharge validation", "WMO identifier check", "percentage missing threshold", "minimum valid observations"], "summary_hash": "6954969fbbd1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:33:04+00:00"}
