{"summary": "Defines a Stable Diffusion 3 pipeline that incorporates Plug‑and‑Play Attention Guidance (PAG) to transform textual prompts into images. The pipeline coordinates a conditional transformer, a flow‑match scheduler, a variational auto‑encoder, and three frozen text encoders (two CLIP variants and a T5 model) with their tokenizers, handling prompt tokenization, latent encoding, guided denoising, and final image decoding.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to generate high‑quality, AI‑driven images from text prompts using advanced attention guidance, supporting applications in creative design, marketing, advertising, and product visualization.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion 3", "text-to-image generation", "plug-and-play attention guidance", "PAG", "diffusion pipeline", "flow-match scheduler", "variational auto-encoder", "CLIP encoder", "T5 encoder", "latent denoising", "AI image synthesis"], "summary_hash": "bf5f7d8e6e29", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:16:58+00:00"}
