{"summary": "The module implements a Terraform check for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) security lists, examining each ingress rule to verify that it is not configured as stateless. It extends the generic resource check framework, categorizes the rule under security, and flags a failure when any ingress rule is marked stateless, encouraging stateful traffic handling.", "business_intent": "Ensure OCI infrastructure-as-code adheres to security best practices by preventing stateless ingress rules that could bypass connection tracking, thereby strengthening network security and compliance.", "keywords": ["OCI", "Terraform", "security list", "ingress rule", "stateless", "compliance", "infrastructure as code", "network security", "stateful"], "summary_hash": "24dda7c3f3e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:24:48+00:00"}
