{"summary": "The module defines an optimization framework for approximating a target unitary using a circuit composed of CNOT gates and single‑qubit rotations. It provides an abstract representation of the problem, utilities to count CNOTs and rotation parameters, and a concrete implementation that evaluates the objective and its gradient for a given circuit layout.", "business_intent": "To support quantum software tools in efficiently compiling arbitrary unitaries into hardware‑friendly gate sequences by minimizing the number of CNOT operations and optimizing rotation angles, thereby reducing circuit depth and error rates in quantum processors.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit synthesis", "CNOT gate optimization", "approximate compilation", "objective function", "gradient computation", "unitary decomposition", "Qiskit", "quantum computing", "rotation gates", "linear algebra"], "summary_hash": "a24520ac2d2a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:00:30+00:00"}
