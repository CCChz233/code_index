{"summary": "The module implements a Torch‑ORT backend for the Optimum Benchmark framework, providing configuration handling, model loading (including pretrained and weight‑less models), and training execution using ONNX Runtime. It supports optional parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning (PEFT) and fast weight initialization, enabling comprehensive performance benchmarking of PyTorch models with the Torch‑ORT runtime.", "business_intent": "Enable users to benchmark and evaluate the performance of PyTorch models on the ONNX Runtime (Torch‑ORT) backend with flexible configuration and advanced loading/training options, facilitating performance optimization and comparison across different deployment scenarios.", "keywords": ["torch-ort", "onnx runtime", "benchmark", "model loading", "configuration", "PEFT", "fast weight initialization", "training", "backend", "optimum"], "summary_hash": "443d7031b357", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:33:04+00:00"}
