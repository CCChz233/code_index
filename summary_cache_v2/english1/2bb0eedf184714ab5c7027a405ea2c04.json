{"summary": "The module provides utilities for type inspection and model adaptation within the Instructor DSL. It includes mechanisms to identify simple/primitive types, validate subclass relationships, and a ModelAdapter class that converts arbitrary response models into a standardized Pydantic BaseModel while retaining the original content for downstream processing.", "business_intent": "Facilitate consistent validation and representation of type information and response schemas in the Instructor framework, ensuring that models can be uniformly handled when interfacing with OpenAI function calls and partial schema definitions.", "keywords": ["type inspection", "simple type detection", "subclass validation", "model adaptation", "Pydantic BaseModel", "Instructor DSL", "response schema handling", "OpenAI function calls"], "summary_hash": "cbf58ba76863", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:34:27+00:00"}
