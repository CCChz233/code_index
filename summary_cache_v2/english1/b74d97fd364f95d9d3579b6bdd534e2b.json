{"summary": "A suite of unit tests that validates a translation pass which converts parameterized quantum gates while preserving all other gate types. The tests cover scenarios with unsupported gates, exclusive parameterized gate unrolling, target-specific behavior, and cases where translation cannot be performed.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability of the quantum circuit compilation pipeline by confirming that the translation pass correctly handles parameterized gates and leaves non‑parameterized gates unchanged, thereby preventing unintended circuit modifications.", "keywords": ["quantum computing", "parameterized gates", "gate translation", "unit testing", "circuit compilation", "unrolling", "target architecture", "unsupported gates", "translation validation"], "summary_hash": "e5e1626e6261", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:28:22+00:00"}
