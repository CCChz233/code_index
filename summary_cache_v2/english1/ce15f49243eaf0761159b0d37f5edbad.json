{"summary": "Provides a command‑line utility that configures and runs inference with a LoRA‑adapted Stable Diffusion model using NVIDIA NeMo. It prepares the model configuration, sets up a distributed trainer, loads the fine‑tuned checkpoint, processes text prompts, generates images, and saves the results.", "business_intent": "Allow end‑users and developers to quickly generate high‑quality images from textual descriptions by leveraging a pre‑trained diffusion model enhanced with low‑rank adaptation, without requiring full model retraining.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "LoRA", "text-to-image", "inference", "image generation", "NeMo", "Megatron", "distributed training", "model configuration", "command line"], "summary_hash": "501200aa58f9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:38:14+00:00"}
