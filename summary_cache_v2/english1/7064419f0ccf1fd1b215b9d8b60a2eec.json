{"summary": "The module implements memory‑efficient dataset abstractions for natural‑language processing, offering lazy, line‑by‑line access to large CSV, text, and line‑delimited JSON files via NumPy memmap. It also supplies utilities to construct and manage index files and an online mapping mechanism that enables dynamic up‑/down‑sampling and two‑level pseudo‑random shuffling of samples.", "business_intent": "Provide scalable, low‑memory data loading and flexible sampling for language‑model training pipelines that need to handle massive text corpora without loading entire files into RAM.", "keywords": ["memory‑mapped", "lazy loading", "CSV", "JSONL", "text files", "language modeling", "dataset", "NumPy memmap", "online sample mapping", "shuffling", "upsampling", "downsampling", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "bd755db9b50f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:27:52+00:00"}
