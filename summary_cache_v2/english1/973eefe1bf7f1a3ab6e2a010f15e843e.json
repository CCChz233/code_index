{"summary": "Provides a test suite that validates the EchoRZXWeylDecomposition optimization pass, checking that two‑qubit gate decompositions are correctly transformed, that gate counts are reduced where expected, that decomposition angles match the Weyl parameters, and that the resulting circuits remain unitary‑equivalent for both native and non‑native Weyl decompositions.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability and efficiency of quantum circuit transpilation by automatically testing a specific optimization pass, thereby supporting high‑quality quantum software development and ensuring that performance improvements do not compromise computational correctness.", "keywords": ["quantum transpilation", "optimization pass", "EchoRZXWeylDecomposition", "Weyl decomposition", "gate count reduction", "unitary equivalence", "Qiskit testing", "two-qubit gates", "circuit verification", "software quality assurance"], "summary_hash": "92a58bc34e89", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:51:31+00:00"}
