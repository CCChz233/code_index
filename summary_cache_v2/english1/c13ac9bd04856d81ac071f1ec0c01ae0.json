{"summary": "The module provides a test suite for validating Lightning's automatic mixed‑precision (AMP) capabilities. It defines a lightweight model with helper methods to check autocast activation and to execute training and prediction under AMP, and includes tests that run the model on CPU, GPU, multi‑GPU DDP managed by SLURM, and with 16‑bit gradient clipping.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that AMP works correctly across various hardware and deployment scenarios, preventing regressions and ensuring stable mixed‑precision training in production deployments of the Lightning framework.", "keywords": ["automatic mixed precision", "AMP", "PyTorch Lightning", "testing", "CPU", "GPU", "DDP", "SLURM", "gradient clipping", "precision 16", "BoringModel", "trainer", "autocast"], "summary_hash": "0444c32647e8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:40:39+00:00"}
