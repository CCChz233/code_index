{"summary": "The module showcases a complete workflow for training a MoNet (Mixture Model Network) on a citation graph dataset using DGL and PyTorch. It defines a lightweight neural network with GMMConv layers, loads a standard citation dataset, parses runtime options, executes a training loop, and evaluates node classification performance.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example that helps researchers and engineers quickly prototype and benchmark MoNet‑based graph neural networks for node classification on citation networks, demonstrating integration of DGL data pipelines with PyTorch models.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "DGL", "MoNet", "graph neural network", "citation dataset", "node classification", "GMMConv", "training loop", "evaluation", "example script"], "summary_hash": "d6339bca2e25", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:20:43+00:00"}
