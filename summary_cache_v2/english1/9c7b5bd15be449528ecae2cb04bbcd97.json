{"summary": "A test suite that validates the behavior of the spatial transformer component within a 2D transformer model, covering default settings and a range of configurable options such as normalization layers, attention bias, cross‑attention dimensions, dropout, feed‑forward configurations, GELU approximations, discrete handling, and timestep integration.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of the 2D transformer’s spatial attention mechanisms so that downstream AI products (e.g., image synthesis or diffusion pipelines) function reliably across different model configurations.", "keywords": ["Transformer2D", "spatial transformer", "unit testing", "normalization layers", "attention bias", "cross‑attention", "dropout", "feed‑forward", "GELU approximation", "discrete input", "timestep", "model validation"], "summary_hash": "c8bfe4bfd3bd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:01:13+00:00"}
