{"summary": "This module provides utilities to compute and apply a 2‑D translation registration to image data stored in Zarr format. It loads NGFF image and well metadata, converts region‑of‑interest tables to index representations, builds image pyramids, updates well metadata with the new registration offsets, and writes the transformed image data back to a Zarr hierarchy.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the spatial alignment of microscopy images across wells or plates, ensuring that downstream quantitative analyses operate on consistently registered data.", "keywords": ["image registration", "translation", "Zarr", "NGFF", "metadata update", "region of interest", "pyramid construction", "microscopy", "spatial alignment", "well metadata"], "summary_hash": "5893a5922513", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:57:09+00:00"}
