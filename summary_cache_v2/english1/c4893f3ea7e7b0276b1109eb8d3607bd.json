{"summary": "This module implements the ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) subsystem for WebRTC, providing data structures for ICE candidates, gathering local candidates, encapsulating authentication parameters, and managing the ICE transport lifecycle. It integrates with the aioice library to perform network probing, STUN/TURN interactions, and candidate exchange, exposing asynchronous events and state information for higher‑level peer connection logic.", "business_intent": "Facilitate reliable peer‑to‑peer media and data streams in real‑time communication applications by handling NAT traversal, authentication, and transport management required for establishing WebRTC connections.", "keywords": ["ICE", "candidate", "gatherer", "transport", "WebRTC", "NAT traversal", "STUN", "TURN", "signaling", "aioice", "asynchronous", "authentication", "peer connection"], "summary_hash": "84855a89ddd4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:46:05+00:00"}
