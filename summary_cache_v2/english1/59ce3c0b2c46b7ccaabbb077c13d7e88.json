{"summary": "This module provides a class that encapsulates the configuration of temporal discretization for groundwater flow and transport simulations. It manages step lengths, number of steps, transient versus steady‑state modes, and related multipliers, validates consistency with the associated flow model, and leverages Jinja2 templating to render the settings into model input files.", "business_intent": "Enable modelers to define, validate, and render time‑discretization parameters for groundwater simulations in a consistent and automated way, reducing setup errors and streamlining the preparation of simulation input.", "keywords": ["time discretization", "groundwater modeling", "transient simulation", "steady-state", "step length", "number of steps", "multipliers", "model consistency", "Jinja2 templating", "simulation input generation"], "summary_hash": "31e670445a2c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:47:20+00:00"}
