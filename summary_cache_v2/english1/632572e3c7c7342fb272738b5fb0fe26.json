{"summary": "Applies random adjustments to an image's brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue using OpenCV, with configurable ranges and a probability of execution. The order of adjustments is randomized per image, and the transform supports both uint8 and float32 images with 1 or 3 channels.", "business_intent": "Enhance training datasets by diversifying visual appearance, helping computer‑vision models become more robust to lighting and color variations.", "keywords": ["color jitter", "brightness adjustment", "contrast adjustment", "saturation adjustment", "hue shift", "image augmentation", "OpenCV", "random transform", "probability", "data augmentation"], "summary_hash": "0049c4e0573f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:19:27+00:00"}
