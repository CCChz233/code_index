{"summary": "The script demonstrates how to build a simple MNIST image classifier using PyTorch Lightning. It defines a lightweight neural‑network backbone, wraps it in a Lightning module that handles training, validation, testing and prediction, provides a data module for loading MNIST splits, and launches the workflow through a command‑line interface.", "business_intent": "Provide an educational reference for developers to learn modular Lightning project structure, model‑backbone integration, and CLI‑driven training of image classification models.", "keywords": ["PyTorch Lightning", "MNIST", "image classification", "backbone network", "data module", "CLI", "training loop", "linear layers", "neural network"], "summary_hash": "c7dd699f5acc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:49:28+00:00"}
