{"summary": "This module implements the DiNTS (Differentiable Neural Architecture Search) framework, providing building blocks such as configurable cells, mixed operations, and stem components, along with utilities for estimating RAM usage. It offers mechanisms to construct, instantiate, and search network topologies from binary architecture codes, with TorchScript‑compatible interfaces for seamless integration and deployment.", "business_intent": "Facilitate automated, resource‑aware design of high‑performance deep learning models for medical imaging and related domains by enabling efficient neural architecture search and deployment of optimized networks.", "keywords": ["neural architecture search", "DiNTS", "medical imaging", "PyTorch", "TorchScript", "mixed operation", "configurable cell", "topology construction", "RAM cost estimation", "resource‑aware modeling"], "summary_hash": "f9ddae7be0de", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:19:11+00:00"}
