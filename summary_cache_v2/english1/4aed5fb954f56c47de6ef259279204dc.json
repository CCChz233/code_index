{"summary": "Provides a collection of image‑only utilities and Albumentations transforms that modify pixel intensity distributions and frequency content to bridge domain gaps. Includes generic scaling transformers, histogram matching, cumulative distribution alignment, low‑frequency mutation, and Fourier‑domain style transfer, all with fitting, application, and inversion capabilities.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and data scientists to reduce domain shift and improve model generalization by augmenting and normalizing image data across different source and target domains, facilitating robust training and deployment of computer‑vision systems.", "keywords": ["domain adaptation", "image augmentation", "histogram matching", "Fourier transform", "low‑frequency swap", "pixel distribution scaling", "min‑max scaling", "standard scaling", "cumulative distribution alignment", "frequency domain manipulation", "data distribution alignment"], "summary_hash": "9c3a5590cb31", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:30:16+00:00"}
