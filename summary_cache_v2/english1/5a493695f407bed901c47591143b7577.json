{"summary": "This module implements a generic callable wrapper for backend functions and a foundational module class that together enable Python code to dynamically invoke, register, and manage DGL's C++ library functions through a type‑erased FFI interface.", "business_intent": "Provide a seamless bridge between Python and the DGL native library, allowing developers to extend, register, and call low‑level operations without dealing with C++ details, thereby simplifying integration and modular development.", "keywords": ["FFI", "type erasure", "dynamic function invocation", "backend integration", "module management", "function registration", "Python‑C++ bridge", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "f7c022b3174d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:36:50+00:00"}
