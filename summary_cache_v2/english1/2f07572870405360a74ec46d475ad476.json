{"summary": "This module implements a runnable example that trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement‑learning agent using Lightning Fabric. It builds a Gymnasium environment, configures distributed training with DDP, performs environment interaction, policy updates, and periodic evaluation while logging metrics to TensorBoard.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run, scalable RL training script that demonstrates how to accelerate PPO with Lightning Fabric for multi‑GPU or multi‑node deployments, facilitating research and production workflows that require fast, distributed policy optimization.", "keywords": ["PPO", "reinforcement learning", "Lightning Fabric", "distributed training", "DDP", "Gymnasium", "TensorBoard", "PyTorch", "policy optimization", "multi‑GPU"], "summary_hash": "7ca224996b61", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:50:27+00:00"}
