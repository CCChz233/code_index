{"summary": "This module defines automated tests that set up a temporary environment, download model bundles from NGC and the MMAR repository, verify their integrity via hash checks, load the bundles into MONAI, and clean up afterwards. It validates that the download mechanisms work correctly across different configurations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee reliable and reproducible acquisition of pretrained medical imaging models for downstream research and clinical deployment by testing the end‑to‑end download and loading pipeline.", "keywords": ["testing", "download", "NGC", "MMAR", "model bundles", "MONAI", "hash verification", "temporary files", "parameterized", "torch", "unittest"], "summary_hash": "1b130cb99cce", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:52:10+00:00"}
