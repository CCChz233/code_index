{"summary": "This module delivers an online Latent Dirichlet Allocation implementation optimized for heterogeneous document‑word graphs. It defines structures for tracking document, word, and edge statistics, manages Dirichlet parameters, and offers utilities for graph‑based visualization, distributed execution, model fitting, perplexity computation, topic inference, sampling, and saving/loading the model.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, graph‑oriented LDA library that enables developers and researchers to perform efficient topic modeling on large, heterogeneous text corpora, supporting distributed training and seamless integration with DGL and PyTorch workflows.", "keywords": ["LDA", "online learning", "topic modeling", "document-word graph", "heterogeneous graph", "DGL", "PyTorch", "Dirichlet distribution", "distributed training", "perplexity", "model persistence", "sampling", "visualization"], "summary_hash": "974652c68459", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:53:55+00:00"}
