{"summary": "This module provides a collection of pytest cases that validate the Prefect server's run‑history API. It prepares test data, clears the database, and parses API responses to confirm that run counts are correctly aggregated into time bins (5‑minute, daily, weekly). The tests also ensure that filtering by flow, deployment, work pool, and work queue works as expected, that pagination limits are respected, and that the final bin includes the specified end date.", "business_intent": "Verify that the server correctly aggregates and returns run‑history information for monitoring and analytics, supporting time‑based binning, filtering, and pagination.", "keywords": ["run history", "API testing", "time bins", "task runs", "flow runs", "filters", "pagination", "Prefect server", "FastAPI", "pytest", "database"], "summary_hash": "35491bc855a5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:19:40+00:00"}
