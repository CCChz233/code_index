{"summary": "Provides a transpiler pass that automatically creates a trivial qubit layout by mapping each logical circuit qubit to the corresponding physical qubit in sequential order (0, 1, 2, …). The pass does not require ancilla qubits and works when the target device has at least as many qubits as the circuit.", "business_intent": "Offer a fast, default mapping strategy for quantum circuits to simplify the initial layout step in the compilation flow, ensuring compatibility with devices that have sufficient qubit count without needing complex coupling‑aware placement.", "keywords": ["layout", "trivial mapping", "transpiler pass", "qubit assignment", "quantum circuit", "Qiskit", "default layout", "physical qubits", "logical qubits"], "summary_hash": "15f54b7623fe", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:29:20+00:00"}
