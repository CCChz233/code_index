{"summary": "This module contains unit tests that verify the functionality of Qiskit's readout error mitigation components, including both local and correlated mitigators. The tests assess the correctness of assignment matrix generation, mitigation behavior across various circuit configurations and qubit selections, proper handling of error conditions, and integration with simulated quantum backends.", "business_intent": "Ensure that readout error mitigation mechanisms work accurately and robustly, providing reliable measurement correction for quantum computing workflows.", "keywords": ["readout mitigation", "local readout mitigator", "correlated readout mitigator", "quantum circuit", "Qiskit", "unit testing", "assignment matrix", "error handling", "simulated backend", "measurement error correction", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "f6ef70d32f19", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:37:51+00:00"}
