{"summary": "This module implements a handler for the GLM generative language model, providing utilities to preprocess user queries, construct prompts that incorporate function specifications, and decode the model's responses into structured formats such as abstract syntax trees or execution results. It leverages conversion helpers to translate OpenAPI definitions and tool specifications into model‑compatible prompts and to post‑process the model output for downstream evaluation.", "business_intent": "Facilitate seamless integration of the GLM model within the function‑call leaderboard, allowing automated generation, execution, and assessment of code snippets based on user queries and API specifications.", "keywords": ["GLM", "model handler", "prompt preparation", "query preprocessing", "output decoding", "abstract syntax tree", "execution result", "OpenAPI conversion", "tool conversion", "function call generation", "OSS model integration"], "summary_hash": "b0dbc7565bc0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:43:26+00:00"}
