{"summary": "A collection of unit tests that verify the functionality of the project's memoization utilities, including both a memcached‑backed decorator and a simple in‑memory version. The tests cover result caching, key generation (including tuple keys), expiration handling, explicit deletion, asynchronous refreshes, and preservation of original function signatures for both regular functions and methods.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the caching layer to ensure it correctly stores and retrieves computed values, respects time‑outs, and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the system, thereby maintaining application performance and stability.", "keywords": ["memoization", "cache", "memcached", "unit testing", "expiration", "key generation", "asynchronous update", "function signature preservation", "method caching", "performance"], "summary_hash": "5f70cbc86920", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:05:20+00:00"}
