{"summary": "Implements grouped reversible residual connections for graph neural networks. The input node features are partitioned into several channel groups, a copy of a given GNN module is created for each group, and each group is processed sequentially with reversible residual updates before concatenating the outputs, allowing deep GNNs to be trained efficiently.", "business_intent": "Provide a memory‑efficient, scalable wrapper that enables training of very deep graph neural networks by leveraging reversible residual connections and feature grouping, reducing memory usage and mitigating gradient vanishing.", "keywords": ["reversible residual", "grouped connections", "graph neural network", "deep GNN", "memory efficient", "feature partition", "module cloning", "DGL", "layer concatenation"], "summary_hash": "b83459a9a27c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:55:54+00:00"}
