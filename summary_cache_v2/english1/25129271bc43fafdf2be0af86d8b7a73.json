{"summary": "The module contains a test suite that exercises a multi‑task encoder‑decoder speech model with byte‑pair encoding tokenization. It checks tokenizer creation, model construction, forward computation, checkpoint saving/loading, and end‑to‑end transcription and translation inference.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and robustness of a multi‑task ASR model pipeline, ensuring that BPE tokenization, model persistence, and both speech‑to‑text and speech‑to‑translation functionalities work as expected before deployment.", "keywords": ["ASR", "multitask", "encoder-decoder", "BPE tokenizer", "model initialization", "forward pass", "checkpoint", "inference", "speech-to-text", "speech-to-translation", "unit testing", "NeMo", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "67d00c987792", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:28:14+00:00"}
