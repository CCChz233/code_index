{"summary": "Provides a batch-wise augmentation that randomly chooses acceptor images, selects a donor image (the previous one in the batch), picks a random label (excluding specified ones) from the donor's segmentation mask, and copies the corresponding image region and mask into the acceptor. The process is governed by per‑image and per‑batch probabilities and supports any spatial dimensionality.", "business_intent": "Create synthetic variability in training data for semantic segmentation models, particularly in medical imaging, to enhance model robustness to geometric domain shifts and improve generalization.", "keywords": ["data augmentation", "random transplantation", "semantic segmentation", "batch operation", "probability control", "excluded labels", "image feature copying", "mask transplantation", "domain shift robustness", "medical imaging", "hyperspectral images"], "summary_hash": "c99c89be2c47", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:55:39+00:00"}
