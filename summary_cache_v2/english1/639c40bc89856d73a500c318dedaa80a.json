{"summary": "This module serves as a thin wrapper that lazily re-exports the sparse linear algebra functionality from the underlying SciPy-compatible submodule, allowing users to access solvers and related utilities through the CuPy sparse.linalg namespace without incurring import costs upfront.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient access to sparse linear algebra solvers (e.g., CG, GMRES) within the CuPy ecosystem while maintaining compatibility with SciPy-like APIs and minimizing import overhead.", "keywords": ["lazy import", "sparse linear algebra", "CuPy", "solver", "attribute forwarding", "compatibility"], "summary_hash": "b3a6d7929baa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:22:22+00:00"}
