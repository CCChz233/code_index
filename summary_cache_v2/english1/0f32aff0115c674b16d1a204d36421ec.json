{"summary": "A collection of unit tests that verify the functionality of the DAGDependency structure used to represent quantum circuits as directed acyclic graphs. The tests cover node and edge creation, predecessor/successor selection, graph properties such as depth and size, handling of empty graphs, default metadata, and management of quantum and classical registers, including error cases.", "business_intent": "Provide comprehensive validation of the DAGDependency implementation to ensure reliable graph construction, manipulation, and metadata handling within the Qiskit framework, thereby preventing regressions and guaranteeing correct behavior for downstream quantum circuit processing.", "keywords": ["DAGDependency", "directed acyclic graph", "unit testing", "Qiskit", "quantum circuit", "graph nodes", "graph edges", "register management", "depth calculation", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "6b0bbdec6f57", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:40:58+00:00"}
