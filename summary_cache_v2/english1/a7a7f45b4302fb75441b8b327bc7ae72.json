{"summary": "Implements a configurable stack of Griffin processing elements for Megatron language models. The stack assembles attention and recurrent components, offers a simple forward routine to propagate inputs through the ordered layers, and includes helpers for constructing the block and retrieving its internal layers.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable building block that enables developers to assemble and train large‑scale Griffin‑based transformer language models within the Megatron framework, improving modularity and performance for NLP applications.", "keywords": ["Griffin", "Megatron", "language modeling", "transformer", "layer stack", "multi‑query attention", "recurrent layer", "tensor parallelism", "PyTorch", "NLP"], "summary_hash": "c07163d1aefc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:11:43+00:00"}
