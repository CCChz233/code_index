{"summary": "Implements a quantum gate that performs a set of Pauli‑Z rotations selected uniformly by the binary state of a group of control qubits, allowing a single gate to represent many conditional R_Z operations.", "business_intent": "Offer a reusable, parameter‑driven gate for building quantum circuits where phase rotations need to be conditioned on multiple control qubits, simplifying the design of algorithms that require controlled Z rotations and reducing circuit depth.", "keywords": ["quantum gate", "uniformly controlled rotation", "Pauli Z", "conditional rotation", "Qiskit", "parameterized gate", "control qubits", "RZ", "generalized gate", "quantum circuit"], "summary_hash": "b6e2c809adef", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:14:21+00:00"}
