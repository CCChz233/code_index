{"summary": "The module defines a high‑level diffusion pipeline that transforms input video frames into new video content using a Stable Diffusion backbone enhanced with custom FRESCO attention mechanisms. It encodes frames into latent space, applies text and optional ControlNet/LoRA conditioning, runs a denoising scheduler with spatial‑guided, temporal‑guided and cross‑frame attention, decodes the latents back to images, and optionally runs a safety filter.", "business_intent": "Enable sophisticated AI‑driven video editing and generation where users can re‑imagine existing footage according to textual prompts and additional control signals, offering fine‑grained control over spatial and temporal dynamics for creative and commercial video production.", "keywords": ["video-to-video", "diffusion model", "Stable Diffusion", "FRESCO attention", "spatial‑temporal attention", "ControlNet", "LoRA", "IP‑Adapter", "latent encoding", "safety checker"], "summary_hash": "c28fcd6c4022", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:01:28+00:00"}
