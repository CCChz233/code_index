{"summary": "SinkCache implements a specialized attention cache that stores per‑layer key and value tensors to support the Attention Sinks technique, allowing language models to generate text beyond their fixed context window while preserving fluency. It manages the cache size, applies rotary position embeddings, provides length queries, and supports reordering and updating of stored states as new tokens are processed.", "business_intent": "Enable large‑scale language models to maintain coherent generation over extended sequences without expanding memory, facilitating applications such as long‑form content creation, dialogue systems, and document summarization that require context beyond the native transformer window.", "keywords": ["attention sink", "cache", "key-value states", "context window", "long‑range generation", "transformer", "rotary position embedding", "reorder", "update"], "summary_hash": "3cce78863e4b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:21:15+00:00"}
