{"summary": "This module automates the creation of source files for fast multi‑head attention (FMHA) kernels targeting HIP GPUs. It uses predefined templates and parameter mappings to generate forward, backward, and inference kernel instances, as well as reference versions, by populating placeholders with specific data types, boolean flags, and configuration options.", "business_intent": "To streamline the production of highly optimized GPU kernels for attention mechanisms, reducing manual coding effort and ensuring consistency across different kernel configurations, thereby accelerating deep‑learning model performance on AMD hardware.", "keywords": ["attention", "GPU", "HIP", "kernel generation", "FMHA", "code templates", "forward pass", "backward pass", "inference", "reference implementation", "high performance", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "4bfaf5f8e059", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:30:26+00:00"}
