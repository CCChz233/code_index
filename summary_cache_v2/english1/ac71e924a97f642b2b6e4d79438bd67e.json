{"summary": "This module provides a suite of unit tests that verify the behavior of the Optimize1qGates transpiler pass in Qiskit. The tests check that single‑qubit gates are correctly merged, that the optimizer works with basis translation, that it can reduce gate parameters, and that it raises appropriate errors for unsupported cases.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the quantum circuit compilation process efficiently minimizes single‑qubit gate sequences, leading to lower circuit depth, reduced error rates, and improved performance on quantum hardware.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "transpiler", "single-qubit gate optimization", "gate merging", "basis translation", "parameter reduction", "unit testing", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "36800a6a7af5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:45:48+00:00"}
