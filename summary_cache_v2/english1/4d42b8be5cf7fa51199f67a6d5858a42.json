{"summary": "The module contains unit tests that aim to verify that the uxarray library can correctly read and interpret datasets formatted according to the ESMF (Earth System Modeling Framework) standard. The tests construct file paths, invoke the library's reading functions, and perform basic checks on the resulting data structures, serving as regression safeguards for data ingestion functionality.", "business_intent": "Ensure reliable ingestion of ESMF-formatted scientific data into the uxarray platform, supporting accurate downstream analysis and modeling workflows in Earth system research.", "keywords": ["ESMF", "uxarray", "unit test", "data ingestion", "Earth system modeling", "dataset reading", "geospatial data", "regression testing"], "summary_hash": "30bee33b471a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:25:27+00:00"}
