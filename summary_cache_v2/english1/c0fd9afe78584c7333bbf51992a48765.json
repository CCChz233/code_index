{"summary": "Defines a NeMo model class that encapsulates the end‑to‑end pipeline for translating natural‑language utterances into SPARQL queries. It sets up tokenizers, prepares the Text2Sparql dataset, configures a transformer‑based encoder‑decoder (e.g., BART), and implements training, validation, and test steps with metrics such as perplexity, leveraging PyTorch Lightning for orchestration.", "business_intent": "Enable applications to automatically generate SPARQL queries from user questions, facilitating natural‑language interfaces to knowledge graphs and improving data retrieval in conversational AI systems.", "keywords": ["text2sparql", "natural language processing", "SPARQL generation", "transformer", "encoder-decoder", "BART", "tokenization", "dataset loading", "training pipeline", "validation", "testing", "perplexity metric", "PyTorch Lightning", "NeMo", "knowledge graph querying"], "summary_hash": "86cc2163ce2e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:37:23+00:00"}
