{"summary": "The module defines a Query class that aggregates a wide range of shortcut query functions for ANSYS MAPDL, covering geometry (coordinates, angles, distances, areas), connectivity, element centroids, line positions and slopes, nodal displacements and rotations, selection status, and nearest‑entity lookups across nodes, keypoints, lines, areas, elements, and volumes.", "business_intent": "Provide a convenient, high‑level interface for engineers and developers to quickly retrieve model data from MAPDL, facilitating automation, post‑processing, and custom analysis workflows without needing to call low‑level MAPDL commands directly.", "keywords": ["ANSYS MAPDL", "inline query functions", "geometry queries", "displacement queries", "selection status", "nearest entity", "element centroid", "line slope", "automation", "API wrapper"], "summary_hash": "cf3bcd7c087b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:00:05+00:00"}
