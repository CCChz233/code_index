{"summary": "The file defines unit tests for three MONAI utility functions that manipulate point data in 3D medical imaging: converting point coordinates into disc masks, merging components based on point locations, and sampling points from label volumes. The tests verify output shapes, numerical correctness, and compatibility with CPU and CUDA environments.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability of point‑handling utilities used in 3D healthcare AI pipelines, such as segmentation or analysis, by providing automated validation of their behavior across different hardware configurations.", "keywords": ["MONAI", "point conversion", "disc mask", "component merging", "point sampling", "3D medical imaging", "unit testing", "numpy", "torch", "GPU", "label processing"], "summary_hash": "0f6ca3a63a12", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:29:46+00:00"}
