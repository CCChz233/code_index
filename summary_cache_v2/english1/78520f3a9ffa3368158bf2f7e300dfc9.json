{"summary": "The module provides a suite of unit tests that validate the behavior of the ContainsInstruction transpiler pass. It creates various quantum circuits, converts them into DAG representations—including control‑flow, empty, and simple DAGs—and checks whether the pass correctly identifies the presence or absence of specified instructions.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability of Qiskit's transpiler by confirming that the ContainsInstruction pass accurately detects instruction containment across different circuit configurations, supporting robust quantum program compilation.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "transpiler", "ContainsInstruction", "unit test", "DAGCircuit", "quantum circuit", "instruction detection", "control flow", "empty circuit"], "summary_hash": "a30b27301a1a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:47:34+00:00"}
