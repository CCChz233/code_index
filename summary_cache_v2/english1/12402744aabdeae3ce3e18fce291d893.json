{"summary": "The module implements multi‑token textual inversion for Stable Diffusion, offering a custom CLIP tokenizer that expands a single placeholder into several token embeddings and providing end‑to‑end training pipelines in both PyTorch (with Accelerate) and Flax/JAX. It handles dataset loading, token management, optimizer and checkpoint orchestration, and supports features such as progressive token growth, vector shuffling, and memory‑efficient attention.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and artists to personalize text‑to‑image diffusion models by training compact, multi‑token embeddings that capture new concepts, improving flexibility and quality of generated images while supporting scalable training across hardware platforms.", "keywords": ["textual inversion", "multi-token", "Stable Diffusion", "CLIP tokenizer", "embedding training", "PyTorch", "Flax", "distributed training", "placeholder token", "custom concepts"], "summary_hash": "a6e9c6660d3c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:38:03+00:00"}
