{"summary": "Applies a random rotation to input arrays, sampling rotation angles from specified ranges for each axis (2D or 3D). The transform can preserve the original size or expand the output to fully contain the rotated content, and supports configurable interpolation, padding, and data type handling. It also offers optional lazy execution for deferred computation.", "business_intent": "Enhance training data variability for machine‑learning models, particularly in image and volumetric data pipelines, by providing stochastic rotational augmentation that improves model robustness and generalization.", "keywords": ["random rotation", "data augmentation", "lazy execution", "interpolation", "padding mode", "2D/3D support", "probability", "keep size", "torch grid_sample"], "summary_hash": "a429d1188de2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:07:00+00:00"}
