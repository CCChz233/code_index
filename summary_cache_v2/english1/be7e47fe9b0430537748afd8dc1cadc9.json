{"summary": "This module implements the core FeatureStore class, offering a high‑level API to define, register, version, materialize, and retrieve machine‑learning features. It coordinates interactions with data sources, feature views (batch, stream, on‑demand), infra providers, and the feature registry, handling metadata, storage backends, and lifecycle operations for both offline and online serving.", "business_intent": "Provide data and ML engineers with a unified, programmatic way to manage the end‑to‑end lifecycle of features—creation, validation, storage, materialization, and real‑time serving—so that models can be trained and deployed with reliable, versioned feature data.", "keywords": ["feature store", "feature registration", "materialization", "online serving", "batch feature view", "stream feature view", "on‑demand feature view", "data source management", "infra provider", "registry", "ML feature lifecycle", "validation", "versioning"], "summary_hash": "4e87af0a4a00", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:18:02+00:00"}
