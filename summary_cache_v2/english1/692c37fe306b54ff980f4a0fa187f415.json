{"summary": "Provides an SMB relay server that listens for incoming SMB client connections, negotiates the SMB protocol (including SMB1, SMB2, SMB3), extracts authentication credentials, and forwards them to a configured target system to perform a relay attack. Handles session management, error translation, and integrates with auxiliary components such as SOCKS proxy handling and target processing.", "business_intent": "Enables security professionals to conduct penetration testing and red‑team assessments by automating SMB relay attacks, allowing captured credentials to be reused against target services for privilege escalation or lateral movement.", "keywords": ["SMB", "relay attack", "authentication capture", "NTLM", "penetration testing", "credential forwarding", "network security", "SMB1", "SMB2", "SMB3", "SPNEGO", "red team"], "summary_hash": "f80b17dc0339", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:19:00+00:00"}
