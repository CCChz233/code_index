{"summary": "The module provides an implementation of the DDIM sampling scheduler for diffusion models, handling noise schedules, timestep spacing, clipping, thresholding, and various prediction strategies to guide the denoising process during inference. It includes a data container for scheduler step outputs and helper utilities for beta computation and SNR rescaling.", "business_intent": "To enable efficient and controllable sampling of diffusion-based generative models, facilitating high-quality image generation and other generative AI tasks within PyTorch pipelines.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "DDIM", "scheduler", "sampling", "denoising", "noise schedule", "timestep", "inference", "PyTorch", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "551209a174d8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:14:15+00:00"}
