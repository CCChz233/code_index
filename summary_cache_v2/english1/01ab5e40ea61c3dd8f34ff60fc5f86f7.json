{"summary": "The module implements audio‑domain loss functions for speech models, including a configurable mean‑squared‑error loss with optional per‑channel weighting and reduction, and a scale‑invariant signal‑to‑distortion ratio loss. Both losses support masking of padded frames, integrate with NeMo's neural‑type system, and operate on batched audio tensors.", "business_intent": "Provide robust loss metrics for training automatic speech recognition and related audio processing models, enabling more accurate and stable learning by measuring waveform fidelity and distortion.", "keywords": ["audio loss", "mean squared error", "signal to distortion ratio", "scale invariant", "speech recognition", "NeMo", "neural types", "masking", "batch reduction", "per channel weighting", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "23c4ec7b588a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:10:04+00:00"}
