{"summary": "Implements the logic for creating exchange files that split a MODFLOW 6 groundwater model into multiple sub‑models for parallel execution. The module prepares geometric boundaries, renders visual representations of the partitions, and configures generation options, and it is automatically invoked when a simulation is divided.", "business_intent": "Facilitate high‑performance, distributed groundwater simulations by automating the creation of inter‑submodel exchange structures, reducing manual setup effort and ensuring consistent partitioning across parallel runs.", "keywords": ["groundwater modeling", "MODFLOW 6", "model partitioning", "parallel execution", "exchange files", "geometric bounds", "visual rendering", "configuration options", "submodel splitting", "automatic instantiation"], "summary_hash": "9d9f3bc138bf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:48:37+00:00"}
