{"summary": "This module supplies the API for compiling classical (potentially irreversible) Boolean functions into quantum circuits. It offers a decorator that transforms a Python function with bit‑level type hints into a ClassicalFunction object, which can be synthesized into a reversible circuit using the Tweedledum library.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to embed classical logic directly into quantum programs by automatically converting annotated Python functions into quantum oracles and other circuit components, streamlining algorithm construction and reducing manual circuit design effort.", "keywords": ["classical function compilation", "quantum circuit synthesis", "decorator", "reversible synthesis", "Tweedledum", "Boolean expression", "Qiskit", "Int1", "quantum oracle", "type hints"], "summary_hash": "da603ee71aed", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:10:33+00:00"}
