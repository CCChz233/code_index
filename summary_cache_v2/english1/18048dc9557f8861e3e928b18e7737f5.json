{"summary": "The module defines a flexible, operating‑system aware connector framework that abstracts the conversion of data between source and target representations, manages storage locations, default paths, and caching. It also provides a specialized model connector for preparing, saving, and loading PyTorch Lightning models and their trainers, encapsulating framework‑specific details behind a unified interface.", "business_intent": "To streamline the handling of data and model artifacts across different file systems and storage backends, enabling reliable serialization, caching, and restoration of Lightning models for reproducible training and deployment pipelines.", "keywords": ["connector", "OS-aware", "path management", "caching", "storage abstraction", "model persistence", "PyTorch Lightning", "trainer serialization", "checkpoint handling", "data conversion"], "summary_hash": "982a85e2d156", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:50:12+00:00"}
