{"summary": "An abstract base class for RDF‑derived graph datasets that manages downloading raw files, parsing entities and relations, converting RDF triples into a DGL graph (with optional reverse edges), caching the processed graph, and providing train/test splits. Subclasses supply concrete parsing and processing logic and define the target node category for prediction.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the creation and use of RDF graph datasets for machine‑learning applications such as node classification by handling data acquisition, preprocessing, graph construction, and split management in a reusable way.", "keywords": ["RDF", "graph dataset", "DGL", "entity parsing", "relation parsing", "graph construction", "caching", "train/test split", "node classification", "reverse edges", "data preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "49b35422b9bc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:45:00+00:00"}
