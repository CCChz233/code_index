{"summary": "Implements an auto‑regressive greedy decoder for RNN‑Transducer models, combining a decoder and joint network to generate token sequences step‑by‑step. It can limit symbols per time step and optionally records alignment histories and per‑frame confidence scores using configurable confidence calculations (max probability or various entropy measures).", "business_intent": "Enable fast, low‑latency transcription in speech‑to‑text applications by providing a lightweight inference decoder that supplies real‑time output, optional confidence metrics, and alignment data for downstream processing or analytics.", "keywords": ["greedy decoding", "RNN‑Transducer", "speech recognition", "inference", "auto‑regressive", "alignment tracking", "confidence scoring", "entropy", "max probability", "real‑time transcription"], "summary_hash": "4b119997da7d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:30:58+00:00"}
