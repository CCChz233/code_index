{"summary": "This module contains unit tests for the HoverNet loss component used in pathology image analysis. It provides utilities to generate synthetic input tensors, configures transformations such as smoothing and rotation, and verifies that the loss class raises appropriate errors for invalid hyperparameter settings and returns tensors with the correct dimensionality.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and robustness of the HoverNet loss implementation to prevent runtime failures in medical imaging pipelines, ensuring that misconfigurations are caught early and that loss outputs match expected shapes for downstream model training.", "keywords": ["HoverNet", "loss function", "unit testing", "PyTorch", "MONAI", "pathology imaging", "synthetic data", "tensor shape validation", "hyperparameter error handling", "Gaussian smoothing", "image rotation", "HoVer maps"], "summary_hash": "acba35ba8f58", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:32:24+00:00"}
