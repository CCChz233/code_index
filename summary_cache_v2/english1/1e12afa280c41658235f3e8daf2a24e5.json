{"summary": "This package provides a comprehensive set of unit tests that validate the XX gate decomposition framework used for two‑qubit quantum circuit synthesis. The tests cover circuit generation, decomposition correctness, polytope utilities, Weyl group transformations, and supporting matrix utilities, ensuring that the synthesized circuits faithfully reproduce target unitaries and handle edge cases appropriately.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness, determinism, and robustness of quantum two‑qubit synthesis algorithms, enabling reliable generation of XX‑based circuits for quantum software development and preventing regressions in future code changes.", "keywords": ["quantum computing", "two-qubit synthesis", "XX gate decomposition", "unit testing", "circuit verification", "Weyl group", "polytope", "monodromy", "quantum circuit synthesis", "software quality"], "summary_hash": "a0308e053159", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:12:37+00:00"}
