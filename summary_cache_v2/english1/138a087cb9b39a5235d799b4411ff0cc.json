{"summary": "The module defines a two‑stage text‑to‑speech synthesis pipeline that first converts mel‑scale spectrograms to linear‑frequency spectrograms and then reconstructs audio waveforms. It includes utilities for preparing training and validation data, handling device placement, and performing spectrogram inversion using a pseudo‑inverse method or the Griffin‑Lim algorithm, with optional GPU acceleration.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to integrate a configurable, end‑to‑end speech generation component into applications, facilitating the production of high‑quality synthetic speech from mel spectrogram inputs.", "keywords": ["text-to-speech", "speech synthesis", "mel spectrogram", "linear spectrogram", "Griffin-Lim", "pseudo-inverse", "two-stage model", "audio waveform generation", "NeMo", "PyTorch", "GPU acceleration"], "summary_hash": "675c8673b577", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:56:44+00:00"}
