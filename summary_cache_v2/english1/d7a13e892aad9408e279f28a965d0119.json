{"summary": "Implements a raw network relay server for the NTLMRelayX tool, providing a handler that processes NTLM authentication messages, forwards them to target services, and supports post‑authentication actions such as command execution or hash extraction. The server sets up listening sockets, manages active connections, and integrates with target processing utilities to facilitate credential relay attacks.", "business_intent": "Allows security testers and penetration‑testing teams to simulate and assess NTLM relay vulnerabilities by capturing and forwarding authentication traffic to chosen targets, enabling credential harvesting and subsequent exploitation.", "keywords": ["NTLM", "relay attack", "raw server", "authentication forwarding", "credential harvesting", "penetration testing", "security assessment", "socketserver", "threading", "network proxy"], "summary_hash": "96b9d190f6f4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:19:08+00:00"}
