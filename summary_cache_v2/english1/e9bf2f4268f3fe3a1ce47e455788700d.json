{"summary": "Implements a deprecated Cycle Diffusion pipeline that takes an input image and a text prompt, encodes them into latent space, iteratively denoises the latents with a conditional UNet and scheduler, decodes the final latents back to an image, and optionally runs a safety checker. The pipeline also includes utilities for loading and saving LoRA weights and textual inversion embeddings.", "business_intent": "Enable AI-driven image-to-image transformation guided by textual descriptions, supporting fine‑tuning via LoRA and textual inversion for customized artistic generation.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "cycle diffusion", "image-to-image generation", "diffusion pipeline", "latent denoising", "UNet", "scheduler", "safety checker", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "PyTorch", "transformers", "AI art"], "summary_hash": "c643e2e79653", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:27:45+00:00"}
