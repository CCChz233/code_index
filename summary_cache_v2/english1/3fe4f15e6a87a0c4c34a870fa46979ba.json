{"summary": "This test module validates the newborn outcomes component of a health simulation framework. It sets up a simulation environment, registers relevant modules, and defines a series of test cases that examine data type consistency, risk assessment for complications and mortality in newborns (including preterm, term, and twin scenarios), care‑seeking behavior for infants delivered at home, and the correct triggering and handling of health system interaction (HSI) events such as postnatal checks and resuscitation treatments.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the simulation accurately represents newborn health risks, care pathways, and health system responses, providing reliable evidence for health policy and program evaluation.", "keywords": ["newborn outcomes", "simulation testing", "care seeking", "complications risk", "preterm mortality", "twin births", "health system interaction", "HSI events", "data validation", "policy analysis"], "summary_hash": "2cb6ea1e7483", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:44:59+00:00"}
