{"summary": "This module implements an ALBERT encoder that wraps the HuggingFace Transformers AlbertModel, exposing a NeMo‑compatible forward interface. It inherits from the generic BERT module base, handles input tensors (ids, masks, segment ids), applies the underlying ALBERT layers, and returns the resulting hidden representations for use in downstream NLP pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless integration of pretrained ALBERT models into the NeMo ecosystem so that developers can quickly incorporate state‑of‑the‑art language representations into speech‑oriented or text‑based applications such as classification, question answering, and language understanding.", "keywords": ["ALBERT", "encoder", "HuggingFace", "NeMo", "NLP", "transformer", "pretrained model", "BertModule", "forward pass", "integration"], "summary_hash": "b2d2c3875836", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:22:08+00:00"}
