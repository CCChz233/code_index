{"summary": "The module implements utilities for handling imaging metadata, particularly MRI acquisition parameters. It defines a wrapper around a kernel density estimator to model the distribution of metadata values and detect local minima for density‑based clustering. Supporting functions allow checking MRI‑specific parameters, fitting clustering models, normalizing metadata, and persisting the derived models and parameters for later use in data loading pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable robust preprocessing of medical imaging datasets by automatically analyzing, clustering, and normalizing acquisition metadata (e.g., contrast type, scanner manufacturer) to improve downstream AI model training and evaluation.", "keywords": ["medical imaging", "MRI", "metadata", "kernel density estimation", "clustering", "normalization", "contrast category", "manufacturer category", "scikit-learn", "data loading"], "summary_hash": "8c2c51ca4fe3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:31:09+00:00"}
