{"summary": "Provides a foundational visitor class that walks hierarchical tree structures (such as the Cython abstract syntax tree), dispatches to user‑defined handlers for each node type, and uses the handlers' return values to modify the tree by removing, replacing, or expanding nodes, together with helper utilities for list processing and child recursion.", "business_intent": "Facilitates the implementation of transformation and analysis passes in the Cython compiler by offering a flexible, reusable mechanism for traversing and rewriting ASTs, thereby simplifying code generation and optimisation workflows.", "keywords": ["visitor pattern", "tree traversal", "AST transformation", "node handling", "Cython compiler", "code rewrite", "node replacement", "node removal", "node expansion", "recursive processing", "utility functions"], "summary_hash": "cb32fec8d463", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:32:57+00:00"}
