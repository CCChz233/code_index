{"summary": "The module provides example scripts that demonstrate how to train a neural Text‑to‑SPARQL model with NVIDIA NeMo and how to evaluate the trained model on a test set. It covers data preparation in TSV format, configuration via Hydra, integration with PyTorch Lightning for reproducible training, checkpoint saving, and reporting of metrics such as accuracy and BLEU.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and data scientists to quickly build, train, and assess a natural‑language‑to‑SPARQL translation system for querying knowledge graphs, accelerating the creation of semantic search and question‑answering applications.", "keywords": ["text-to-sparql", "neural translation", "knowledge graph", "semantic parsing", "model training", "model evaluation", "NVIDIA NeMo", "Hydra configuration", "PyTorch Lightning", "BLEU score", "accuracy", "TSV dataset", "model checkpoint"], "summary_hash": "c711e4ee7020", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:59:18+00:00"}
