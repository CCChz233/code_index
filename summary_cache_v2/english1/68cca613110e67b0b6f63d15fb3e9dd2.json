{"summary": "The module provides command‑line utilities for fine‑tuning Stable Diffusion XL models with low‑rank (LoRA) adapters under an ORPO reinforcement‑learning objective. It handles dataset loading (including WebDataset), prompt preparation, model and scheduler configuration, gradient accumulation, distributed execution via Accelerate, periodic validation image generation, metric logging to WandB, and checkpoint management with optional upload to the Hugging Face hub.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to efficiently apply ORPO‑based reinforcement learning to diffusion text‑to‑image models, facilitating reproducible experiments, scalable training, and rapid iteration on high‑quality generative AI solutions.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion XL", "diffusion models", "ORPO", "reinforcement learning", "LoRA adapters", "fine‑tuning", "distributed training", "WebDataset", "Accelerate", "WandB", "Hugging Face hub", "checkpointing", "image generation", "text‑to‑image"], "summary_hash": "766f5b975093", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:38:48+00:00"}
