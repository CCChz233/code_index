{"summary": "Provides a DGL‑based implementation of the Community Detection Graph Neural Network (CDGNN) model, including the network architecture that performs message‑passing on line‑graph representations and a training script that generates synthetic stochastic block model data, builds the hierarchical GNN, optimizes it, and evaluates community recovery using overlap scores.", "business_intent": "Offers a ready‑to‑run reference codebase for researchers and developers to experiment with graph‑neural‑network approaches to community detection, facilitating reproducible experiments and serving as a foundation for extending CDGNN methods in production or academic settings.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "community detection", "stochastic block model", "DGL", "PyTorch", "line graph", "hierarchical GNN", "overlap metric", "synthetic dataset", "training pipeline"], "summary_hash": "63a3d59da85b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:51:38+00:00"}
