{"summary": "A decorator that converts a single‑argument instance method into a lazily evaluated attribute. The first access computes the value, stores it on the object, and all later accesses return the cached result. An optional name parameter allows the cached attribute to be exposed under a different identifier.", "business_intent": "To improve performance by memoizing expensive computations on a per‑instance basis, providing a read‑only attribute that avoids repeated method execution.", "keywords": ["decorator", "cached property", "lazy evaluation", "memoization", "instance attribute", "performance", "read‑only", "property"], "summary_hash": "b0128f449320", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:08:26+00:00"}
