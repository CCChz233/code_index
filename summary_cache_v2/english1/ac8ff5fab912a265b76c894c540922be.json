{"summary": "This module provides a complete mock implementation of the AWS CloudFront service for the Moto library. It defines custom exception types for CloudFront error conditions, constructs in‑memory data models representing distributions, cache behaviours, origins, key groups, public keys, origin access controls, and related configurations, and implements a response layer that parses XML requests, delegates operations to the backend, and generates XML responses for create, read, update, delete, and list actions.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to test and develop applications that interact with CloudFront without accessing real AWS resources, supporting offline unit and integration testing of CloudFront‑related functionality.", "keywords": ["cloudfront", "mock", "moto", "aws", "in-memory backend", "distributions", "cache behaviour", "origins", "key groups", "public keys", "origin access control", "xml API", "exception handling", "testing"], "summary_hash": "e2e4006d6f0e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:51:35+00:00"}
