{"summary": "This module contains unit tests that verify the behavior of the H&E stain extraction and normalization transforms from the MONAI pathology toolkit. The tests check that extracted stain vectors match expected values, that normalization produces correct stain concentrations, and that special cases such as transparent images and invalid inputs are handled appropriately.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the accuracy and robustness of H&E stain processing components used in digital pathology workflows, ensuring reliable downstream analysis and model training.", "keywords": ["H&E stain", "extraction", "normalization", "unit testing", "MONAI", "digital pathology", "image processing", "transparent image handling", "edge case validation", "stain concentration"], "summary_hash": "be063a035f32", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:41:36+00:00"}
