{"summary": "Implements a fast BPE-based tokenizer for the UDOP model, extending HuggingFace's PreTrainedTokenizerFast. It tokenizes text while associating layout bounding boxes, manages special tokens, padding, and token type IDs, and provides encoding utilities for both single and batch inputs.", "business_intent": "Provide efficient preprocessing of document text and layout information to support training and inference of document understanding models, ensuring correct handling of special tokens, padding, and spatial data.", "keywords": ["fast tokenizer", "BPE", "layout", "bounding boxes", "special tokens", "padding", "token type ids", "HuggingFace", "PreTrainedTokenizerFast", "UDOP", "document understanding"], "summary_hash": "976273cfbfb0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:02:42+00:00"}
