{"summary": "Implements a Paint‑by‑Example diffusion pipeline that enables image‑guided inpainting. It includes a visual encoder built on a CLIP vision backbone with transformer blocks to convert reference images into latent feature vectors, a mapper that adapts these vectors for conditioning a Stable Diffusion UNet, and a pipeline that runs the diffusion process, decodes the result with a VAE, and optionally checks safety.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and creators with a ready‑to‑use solution for generating customized images based on example inputs, facilitating rapid content creation, artistic exploration, and integration into applications that require controllable image synthesis.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "image-guided inpainting", "Paint-by-Example", "CLIP vision encoder", "transformer mapper", "Stable Diffusion", "latent representation", "VAE decoder", "safety checker", "content generation"], "summary_hash": "c556ccce408a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:43:01+00:00"}
