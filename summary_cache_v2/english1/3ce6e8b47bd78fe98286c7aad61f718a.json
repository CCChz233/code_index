{"summary": "Implements a 1‑dimensional separable convolution layer that first applies a depthwise convolution independently on each input channel and then a pointwise convolution to combine the resulting features, optionally adding bias and an activation function.", "business_intent": "Provides an efficient way to extract temporal patterns from sequential data such as audio, sensor signals, or time‑series, reducing model size and computation while maintaining expressive power, which helps businesses build faster, lighter deep‑learning models for tasks like forecasting, classification, or anomaly detection.", "keywords": ["separable convolution", "depthwise", "pointwise", "1D", "filters", "stride", "padding", "activation", "bias", "regularization", "constraints", "Keras", "neural network layer", "time series", "efficient parameterization"], "summary_hash": "9027bd03400d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:56:24+00:00"}
