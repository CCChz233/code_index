{"summary": "Provides a PyTorch Lightning logger that connects to the Neptune experiment‑tracking platform, managing the creation or reuse of a Neptune run and exposing methods to record training metrics, hyperparameters, model summaries, checkpoints, and arbitrary artifacts such as files or images. Handles configuration options like API token, project name, run name, tags, and a root namespace, and supports serialization for checkpointing.", "business_intent": "Allow data scientists and ML engineers to seamlessly monitor, log, and reproduce their PyTorch Lightning training experiments within Neptune, facilitating experiment management, performance tracking, and artifact storage.", "keywords": ["neptune", "experiment tracking", "pytorch lightning", "logger", "metrics", "hyperparameters", "model summary", "checkpoints", "artifacts", "run management", "serialization"], "summary_hash": "e252ff673311", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:57:15+00:00"}
