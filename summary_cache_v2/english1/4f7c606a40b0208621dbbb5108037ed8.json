{"summary": "The edge_encoder package supplies interchangeable edge scoring modules for graph neural networks. It includes three lightweight components that compute edge interaction scores using (1) a learnable bilinear transformation, (2) a dot product with a trainable weight tensor, and (3) an element‑wise product of node embeddings. Each module offers a simple forward interface for seamless integration into DGL‑based GNN pipelines.", "business_intent": "Provide flexible, plug‑and‑play edge scoring mechanisms to support downstream graph tasks such as link prediction, edge classification, and relational reasoning, enabling developers to quickly experiment with different interaction functions without custom implementation.", "keywords": ["edge encoder", "graph neural network", "bilinear transformation", "dot product", "element-wise product", "link prediction", "edge classification", "learnable weights", "DGL", "model component"], "summary_hash": "520458d40e3b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:47:59+00:00"}
