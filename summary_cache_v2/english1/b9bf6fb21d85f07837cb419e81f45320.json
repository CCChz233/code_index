{"summary": "The file defines unit tests for the adapter mixin used in NeMo models. It includes a minimal neural module without adapter support, a derived module that enables adapters, and a test suite that checks the mixin’s ability to expose accepted adapter types, validate adapter classes, and reset its state. Helper utilities provide configuration and classpath retrieval for the tests.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correct behavior of the adapter mixin, ensuring that models can reliably incorporate adapter modules for extensibility and modularity in production and research pipelines.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "adapter mixin", "NeMo", "neural module", "adapter validation", "accepted adapter types", "reset functionality", "configuration helper", "model extensibility"], "summary_hash": "a6031aa784f4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:31:19+00:00"}
