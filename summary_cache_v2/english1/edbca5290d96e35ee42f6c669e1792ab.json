{"summary": "A specialized task class that represents an unbounded workload, used when the underlying dataset has no predefined size (e.g., iterable datasets). It extends the generic task abstraction to support infinite data streams and provides utilities for estimating remaining execution time.", "business_intent": "Allow training or processing pipelines to handle endless data sources as manageable tasks, enabling progress tracking and time estimation without requiring a fixed dataset length.", "keywords": ["infinite task", "iterable dataset", "unknown size", "progress tracking", "time estimation", "custom task", "data pipeline", "unbounded workload"], "summary_hash": "794421ba2318", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:23:31+00:00"}
