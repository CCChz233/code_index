{"summary": "The module implements a memory‑mapped indexed dataset tailored for Megatron language‑model training with retrieval augmentation. It defines structures for mapping fragment identifiers to storage locations, supports K‑nearest‑neighbor indexing, and provides a dataset wrapper that can expose whole documents or fixed‑size chunks, optionally extending documents with padding for efficient random access. A builder class handles incremental construction, document boundary management, and final assembly of the binary data and index files.", "business_intent": "To enable scalable, high‑performance storage and retrieval of massive text corpora for training large language models, especially in scenarios that require fast random access, chunked views, and integration with retrieval‑augmented or KNN‑based training pipelines.", "keywords": ["memory-mapped", "indexed dataset", "retrieval augmentation", "language modeling", "Megatron", "KNN index", "chunked access", "random access", "dataset builder", "serialization"], "summary_hash": "591e4583578a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:29:43+00:00"}
