{"summary": "The module implements an adaptive image inpainting workflow built on a diffusion pipeline. It encodes input images, processes textual prompts, and iteratively denoises latent representations while automatically adjusting the provided mask. Supporting components handle mask dilation, trigger actions at specific steps, and generate refined segmentation masks via a PointRend model. The pipeline also offers optional loading of LoRA/textual inversion weights, safety checking, and CPU off‑loading of models.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to experiment with high‑quality, prompt‑guided image inpainting that intelligently expands masks and leverages segmentation models, facilitating creation of customized visual content and prototyping of advanced generative AI applications.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "image inpainting", "adaptive mask", "mask dilation", "segmentation", "PointRend", "CLIP", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "safety check", "CPU offload"], "summary_hash": "623990e5cff2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:03:22+00:00"}
