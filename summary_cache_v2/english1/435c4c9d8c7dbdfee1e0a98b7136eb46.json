{"summary": "The module processes simulation results for maternal and perinatal health, extracts relevant indicators (e.g., anemia prevalence, antenatal care coverage, delivery rates, DALYs, deaths, stillbirths, neonatal mortality), aligns them with Global Burden of Disease reference data, computes confidence intervals, and generates bar‑chart visualisations. It also provides utilities to assemble and clean dataframes needed for model calibration.", "business_intent": "Enable model developers and health analysts to calibrate and validate a maternal‑perinatal simulation model against observed epidemiological data by producing calibrated outputs with confidence intervals and accompanying visual summaries.", "keywords": ["calibration", "confidence interval", "maternal health", "perinatal health", "GBD", "DALY", "mortality", "data extraction", "visualisation", "simulation outputs"], "summary_hash": "0195d76be331", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:59:53+00:00"}
