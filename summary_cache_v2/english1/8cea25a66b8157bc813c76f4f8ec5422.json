{"summary": "The file contains unit tests that verify the behavior of grid boundary extraction utilities. It defines helper routines to create domain masks representing fully active, fully inactive, and unstructured grids, and uses these masks to assert that the boundary coordinate outputs are correct under different domain conditions.", "business_intent": "Validate that the functions responsible for determining the spatial extents of active cells in structured and unstructured grids work as expected, preventing regressions in spatial analysis workflows.", "keywords": ["testing", "unit tests", "grid boundary", "active cells", "inactive cells", "unstructured grid", "xarray", "pytest", "domain mask", "spatial analysis"], "summary_hash": "5bf2edb959fc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:58:10+00:00"}
