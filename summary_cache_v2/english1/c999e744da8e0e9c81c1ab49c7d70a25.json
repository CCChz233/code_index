{"summary": "This module demonstrates how to build and train an Approximate Personalized Propagation of Neural Predictions (APPNP) model for node classification on citation graph datasets using the MXNet backend of DGL. It defines a neural network that first transforms node features and then refines them with a fixed‑step personalized PageRank diffusion, includes utilities for model evaluation, and provides a command‑line interface to run the full training and testing pipeline.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run example that helps developers and researchers understand and apply APPNP‑based graph neural networks with MXNet, facilitating rapid prototyping and benchmarking on standard citation datasets.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "APPNP", "MXNet", "DGL", "node classification", "citation dataset", "personalized PageRank", "diffusion layer", "training loop", "evaluation"], "summary_hash": "49c363ea16e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:09:41+00:00"}
