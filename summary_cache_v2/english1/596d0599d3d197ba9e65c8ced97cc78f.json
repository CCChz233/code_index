{"summary": "This test module provides a collection of parameterized unit tests that verify the correctness of MONAI's safe_dtype_range and get_equivalent_dtype utilities. The tests cover a variety of NumPy and CuPy array types, checking that the functions return accurate numeric limits and compatible data types, including handling of edge cases and GPU arrays.", "business_intent": "To ensure that MONAI's data type conversion helpers reliably compute safe numeric ranges and appropriate equivalent dtypes across CPU (NumPy) and GPU (CuPy) backends, thereby preventing overflow or precision errors in medical imaging workflows.", "keywords": ["unit test", "safe dtype range", "data type conversion", "NumPy", "CuPy", "MONAI", "numeric limits", "backend compatibility", "parameterized testing", "GPU support"], "summary_hash": "e03e923cd596", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:49:33+00:00"}
