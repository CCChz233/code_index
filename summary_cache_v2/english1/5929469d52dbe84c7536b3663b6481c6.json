{"summary": "A collection of unit tests targeting DGL's sparse optimizer implementations (SparseAdam and SparseAdagrad). The tests cover initialization, single‑step updates, handling of different data types, CPU vs. CUDA execution, zero‑step edge cases, and multiprocess scenarios to validate correctness and stability of sparse gradient updates.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correctness and performance of sparse optimization routines used in graph neural network training pipelines, ensuring they work reliably across devices and parallel execution contexts.", "keywords": ["DGL", "SparseAdam", "SparseAdagrad", "optimizer", "multiprocessing", "CPU", "CUDA", "zero step", "dtype", "unit test", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "fed7ba074a6d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:07:38+00:00"}
