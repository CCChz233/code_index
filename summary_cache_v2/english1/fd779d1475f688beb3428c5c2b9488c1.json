{"summary": "This module defines a suite of unit tests that validate the behavior of the gamma logarithm function in the cupyx.scipy.special package. The tests cover scalar inputs, regularly spaced arrays, and special cases such as infinities and NaN values to ensure numerical correctness and consistency with reference implementations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability and scientific accuracy of the cupyx implementation of the gamma logarithm function, supporting robust numerical computations in GPU-accelerated environments.", "keywords": ["gamma", "logarithm", "special function", "unit testing", "cupy", "scipy", "edge cases", "NaN", "Infinity", "array inputs", "scalar inputs"], "summary_hash": "8b58bdb419b3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:30:12+00:00"}
