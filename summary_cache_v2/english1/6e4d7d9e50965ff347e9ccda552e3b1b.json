{"summary": "The module demonstrates how to perform hyper‑parameter optimization for a Sentence‑Transformer model on a natural‑language‑inference dataset. It loads the data, defines a configurable search space, creates the model and loss, runs training with the SentenceTransformerTrainer, and evaluates a metric to guide the optimization process.", "business_intent": "Help machine‑learning engineers automatically tune training parameters for NLI models, speeding up development and improving model performance without manual trial‑and‑error.", "keywords": ["hyperparameter optimization", "natural language inference", "sentence-transformers", "model training", "search space", "objective metric", "evaluation", "loss function", "machine learning", "example script"], "summary_hash": "5d96a16e2461", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:00:53+00:00"}
