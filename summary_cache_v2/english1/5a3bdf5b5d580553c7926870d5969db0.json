{"summary": "This module sets up a registry of attention implementations, exposing a list of supported attention class names and providing a factory mechanism to instantiate an attention module based on a configuration. It also includes placeholder utilities for optional sparsification of attention mechanisms.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible selection and creation of different attention algorithms for transformer models through a configurable registry, facilitating extensibility and potential integration of sparse attention techniques.", "keywords": ["attention", "registry", "factory", "configuration", "sparse attention", "module discovery", "dynamic loading", "transformer"], "summary_hash": "6a12e405399f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:31:03+00:00"}
