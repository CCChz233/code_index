{"summary": "A comprehensive test suite that validates the implementation of Maxwellian and kappa plasma distribution functions across one, two, and three dimensions. The tests check handling of drift velocities, thermal speed parameters, unit-aware versus unitless inputs, normalization, and statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation, using Astropy units and SciPy integration.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the scientific correctness and robustness of plasma distribution calculations in the library, supporting accurate plasma physics modeling and maintaining software quality for research and engineering applications.", "keywords": ["Maxwellian distribution", "kappa distribution", "plasma physics", "unit testing", "normalization", "drift velocity", "thermal speed", "dimensionality", "Astropy units", "SciPy integration", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "8a071f83030d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:08:36+00:00"}
