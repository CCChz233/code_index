{"summary": "The module contains unit tests that rigorously validate the UNet architecture employed in MAISI diffusion models for both 2‑D and 3‑D data. The tests cover a variety of configurations—including attention mechanisms, conditioning inputs, channel dimensions, residual blocks, timestep embeddings, and dropout settings—ensuring that the network produces tensors with the correct shapes, handles optional inputs properly, and raises appropriate errors for invalid parameters.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of the MAISI diffusion UNet implementation, enabling reliable development, integration, and deployment of medical image synthesis models within the MONAI framework.", "keywords": ["UNet", "diffusion model", "MAISI", "2D", "3D", "unit testing", "PyTorch", "MONAI", "attention", "conditioning", "dropout", "shape validation", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "7db50ba459e1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:48:30+00:00"}
