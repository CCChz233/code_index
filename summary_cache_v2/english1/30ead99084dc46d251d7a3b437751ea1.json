{"summary": "The module implements a model class that combines a pre‑trained tagging network with a decoder to perform end‑to‑end text normalization. It manages loading of the tagger and decoder, preprocessing of raw inputs, inference to predict token tags, decoding of those tags into normalized strings, and utilities for batch processing and evaluation against standard test datasets.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑use, high‑accuracy text‑normalization component for speech and NLP applications, enabling developers to convert spoken‑form tokens (numbers, dates, abbreviations, etc.) into their written forms within NeMo pipelines and to assess performance without modifying the underlying models.", "keywords": ["text normalization", "inference", "tagger", "decoder", "pre‑trained model", "evaluation", "NLP", "NeMo", "speech processing"], "summary_hash": "fc0603457d44", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:10:36+00:00"}
