{"summary": "This module defines the core abstract components for Prefect workers, including utilities to construct and adjust job configuration data (labels, environment variables, templating, runner detection, JSON representation) and to prepare flow runs for execution, an abstract worker class that manages the execution lifecycle, communication with the Prefect orchestration API, heartbeats, prefetching, cancellation handling, and event emission, and a result wrapper that encapsulates the outcome of a worker operation.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, extensible foundation for building concrete Prefect workers that can run flow runs across different execution environments while ensuring consistent configuration handling, state transitions, event logging, and error management.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "worker", "base class", "job configuration", "flow run", "orchestration API", "state management", "templating", "environment variables", "labels", "cancellation", "heartbeat", "result encapsulation"], "summary_hash": "054681978704", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:30:10+00:00"}
