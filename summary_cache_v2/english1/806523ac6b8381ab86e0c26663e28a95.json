{"summary": "The script demonstrates how to regrid spatial data arrays from MODFLOW 6 packages onto a different model grid using the xugrid library. It explains the choice of regridding methods based on whether a property is intensive (e.g., temperature) or extensive (e.g., mass), handles no‑data values, and visualizes the original and regridded data with side‑by‑side histograms.", "business_intent": "Provide a practical guide for modelers to correctly transfer package data when changing the simulation grid, ensuring appropriate method selection and preserving data integrity across grid transformations.", "keywords": ["regridding", "MODFLOW 6", "spatial data", "xugrid", "grid transformation", "intensive property", "extensive property", "averaging", "sampling", "no-data handling", "histogram visualization", "regridder", "weights cache"], "summary_hash": "0416e03de6f1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:02:46+00:00"}
