{"summary": "Implements a high‑performance data pipeline that reads audio files and their transcriptions from one or more manifest files, optionally filters by duration, trims silence, resamples audio, extracts acoustic features (e.g., mel‑spectrogram or MFCC), tokenizes the text into sub‑word IDs, adds optional BOS/EOS tokens and padding, and yields batched tensors suitable for training or inference on CPU or GPU using NVIDIA DALI.", "business_intent": "Accelerate large‑scale speech‑recognition model training and inference by providing an efficient, configurable dataset that combines audio preprocessing and sub‑word tokenization in a single DALI pipeline, supporting distributed sharding, shuffling, and batch handling.", "keywords": ["audio loading", "NVIDIA DALI", "manifest", "subword tokenization", "speech recognition", "batching", "feature extraction", "GPU acceleration", "distributed sharding", "padding", "BOS EOS tokens", "silence trimming"], "summary_hash": "0ae34341fc2c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:15:09+00:00"}
