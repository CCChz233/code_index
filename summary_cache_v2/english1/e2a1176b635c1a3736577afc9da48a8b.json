{"summary": "The module implements a set of Albumentations image‑only transforms designed for domain adaptation. It includes a Fourier‑domain style transfer that swaps low‑frequency components with reference images, histogram matching to align intensity distributions, pixel‑distribution adaptation, and template blending with optional additional augmentations, all equipped with validation schemas.", "business_intent": "Provide ready‑to‑use augmentation utilities that modify image statistics to bridge domain gaps, helping computer‑vision models trained on one dataset perform better on different target domains without requiring labeled data.", "keywords": ["domain adaptation", "image augmentation", "Fourier transform", "histogram matching", "pixel distribution adaptation", "template blending", "Albumentations", "computer vision", "semantic segmentation", "unsupervised learning"], "summary_hash": "052839bd6a05", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:28:34+00:00"}
