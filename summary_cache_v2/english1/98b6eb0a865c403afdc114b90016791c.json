{"summary": "Implements an optimal assignment between model predictions and ground‑truth targets using the Hungarian algorithm, weighting classification error, L1 bounding‑box distance, and GIoU loss. Handles cases where predictions outnumber targets by matching the best predictions and treating the rest as background.", "business_intent": "Facilitates precise loss calculation for training a table detection transformer, improving detection accuracy by correctly pairing predictions with actual objects.", "keywords": ["Hungarian matching", "prediction‑target assignment", "object detection", "classification cost", "bounding box L1 loss", "GIoU loss", "training loss computation", "table transformer"], "summary_hash": "41518326c17f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:12:05+00:00"}
