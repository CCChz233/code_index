{"summary": "The class provides a reusable regridding engine that compiles the chosen aggregation or interpolation routine once and then applies it repeatedly to datasets with matching dimensionality, handling optional dimension inference, relative weighting, and extra cell overlap for chunked operations.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, scalable spatial or multidimensional data resampling in scientific workflows by minimizing compilation overhead and allowing custom aggregation functions, thereby improving performance for repeated regridding tasks.", "keywords": ["regridding", "data resampling", "JIT compilation", "Numba", "performance optimization", "multidimensional interpolation", "custom aggregation", "chunked processing", "relative weights", "spatial analysis"], "summary_hash": "ca13a68ba98b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:31:25+00:00"}
