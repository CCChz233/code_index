{"summary": "The GRACE example implements an unsupervised graph contrastive learning pipeline using DGL and PyTorch. It provides utilities to load citation network datasets, generate perturbed graph views through feature and edge dropout, define a GCN‑based encoder with a projection head, train the model with a contrastive loss, and evaluate the learned node embeddings via linear classifiers. A command‑line interface ties together data preparation, augmentation, model construction, training, and evaluation, allowing configurable hyper‑parameters.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run reference implementation of the GRACE algorithm so that researchers and developers can apply contrastive graph representation learning to node classification problems on standard citation graphs and benchmark its performance against other methods.", "keywords": ["DGL", "PyTorch", "graph neural network", "contrastive learning", "GRACE", "node classification", "citation networks", "graph augmentation", "GCN encoder", "linear evaluation"], "summary_hash": "d4ddfb53db77", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:52:22+00:00"}
