{"summary": "The file defines unit‑test suites that verify the functionality of batched alignment and hypothesis data structures used in NeMo ASR decoding. Tests cover creation, result insertion (including masked entries), handling of invalid parameters, batch size constraints, conversion to hypothesis objects, and compatibility with Torch JIT compilation.", "business_intent": "Ensure the correctness and robustness of batched decoding utilities for speech recognition, enabling reliable and efficient inference pipelines in production ASR systems.", "keywords": ["ASR", "batched hypotheses", "batched alignments", "unit tests", "PyTorch JIT", "error handling", "hypothesis conversion", "speech recognition decoding"], "summary_hash": "6e79df90be55", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:32:31+00:00"}
