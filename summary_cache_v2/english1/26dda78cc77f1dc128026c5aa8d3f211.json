{"summary": "The module contains a collection of unit tests that verify CuPy's linear algebra operations such as determinant, matrix rank, norm, log‑determinant, and trace. The tests exercise these functions with a wide range of matrix dimensions, singular cases, empty inputs, and multi‑dimensional scenarios to ensure correct behavior and compatibility with NumPy.", "business_intent": "Provide comprehensive regression testing for CuPy's linear algebra library to guarantee reliable numerical results in scientific and engineering applications that depend on GPU‑accelerated matrix computations.", "keywords": ["CuPy", "linear algebra", "determinant", "matrix rank", "norm", "log-determinant", "trace", "unit testing", "pytest", "NumPy compatibility", "GPU acceleration"], "summary_hash": "8465202b1d5a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:27:03+00:00"}
