{"summary": "This module implements parallel algorithms for combining multiple DataFrames, including concatenation, joins, and merges. It distinguishes between operations on already partition‑aligned indexes—where it aligns partitions, prunes unnecessary ones, and runs per‑partition pandas joins—and operations on unpartitioned indexes or arbitrary columns—where it shuffles data to create aligned partitions and then performs hash‑based joins. Supporting utilities handle partition alignment, metadata management, and edge‑case handling for various join types.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient, scalable DataFrame combination operations in a distributed environment, allowing large datasets to be concatenated or joined across many workers with minimal data movement and maximal parallelism.", "keywords": ["parallel join", "partition alignment", "hash join", "shuffle", "distributed DataFrame", "concatenation", "merge", "Dask", "large‑scale data processing", "partitioned index", "unpartitioned index"], "summary_hash": "3c2363353c1e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:20:57+00:00"}
