{"summary": "A collection of utility modules that support a PyTorch implementation of hierarchical density‑peak clustering. The package offers tools for processing sparse adjacency matrices, estimating point densities and extracting peaks, constructing and managing k‑nearest‑neighbor graphs with FAISS (CPU/GPU), building hierarchical graph structures, evaluating clustering results with standard metrics, and assorted helper routines for reproducibility and timing.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and developers with ready‑to‑use, high‑performance utilities that simplify the development, scaling, and benchmarking of graph‑based clustering pipelines, especially those leveraging density‑peak methods and GPU‑accelerated nearest‑neighbor search.", "keywords": ["clustering", "density peak", "graph processing", "adjacency matrix", "FAISS", "k-nearest neighbors", "GPU acceleration", "PyTorch", "evaluation metrics", "utility functions"], "summary_hash": "3f8a102c8dc1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:55:53+00:00"}
