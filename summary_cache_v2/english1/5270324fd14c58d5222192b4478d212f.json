{"summary": "Implements an equalization augmentation that can be applied to inputs during training, optionally controlled by an initial probability and a temperature parameter for a relaxed Bernoulli sampling scheme. Gradient flow is handled with a straight‑through estimator.", "business_intent": "Enhance model generalization by augmenting training data with intensity equalization, allowing configurable stochastic application while maintaining differentiability for end‑to‑end learning.", "keywords": ["equalization", "augmentation", "probability", "temperature", "relaxed Bernoulli", "STE", "gradient estimator", "image preprocessing", "training robustness"], "summary_hash": "690fbfd8079a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:59:47+00:00"}
