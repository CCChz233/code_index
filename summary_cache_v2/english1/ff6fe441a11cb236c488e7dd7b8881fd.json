{"summary": "Implements an unconditional latent diffusion pipeline that encodes inputs into latent space with a vector‑quantized VAE, repeatedly denoises the latents using a UNet model driven by a DDIM scheduler, and decodes the final latents back into images, exposing a high‑level DiffusionPipeline interface.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to generate images without any conditioning prompts, facilitating creative content creation, prototyping of generative models, and integration of latent diffusion capabilities into applications.", "keywords": ["latent diffusion", "unconditional image generation", "VQ-VAE", "UNet", "DDIM scheduler", "diffusion pipeline", "image synthesis", "encoding", "decoding", "denoising"], "summary_hash": "4f4009a6a7f5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:28:22+00:00"}
