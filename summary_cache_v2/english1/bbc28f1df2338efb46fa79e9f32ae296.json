{"summary": "Implements the SABRE routing algorithm that maps a quantum circuit onto a device's coupling graph by iteratively executing adjacent two‑qubit gates and inserting SWAP operations for non‑adjacent qubits, using a restricted candidate set, a heuristic cost function, and multiple random trials to select the best routing solution.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient transpilation of quantum programs for execution on real hardware by automatically optimizing qubit placement and minimizing additional SWAP gates, thereby reducing circuit depth and error rates.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "routing", "SWAP insertion", "SABRE heuristic", "coupling map", "transpiler", "qubit layout", "optimization", "cost function", "random trials"], "summary_hash": "2544d6b6852b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:27:31+00:00"}
