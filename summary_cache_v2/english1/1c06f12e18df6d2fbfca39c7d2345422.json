{"summary": "The module defines a neural network class that implements the WaveGlow flow‑based vocoder. It transforms raw audio waveforms to and from latent Gaussian distributions conditioned on mel‑spectra, using invertible 1×1 convolutions and WaveNet‑style residual blocks. It provides training and inference pathways, supports model export, and can strip weight‑norm layers for efficient deployment.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑quality, fast neural vocoder for text‑to‑speech pipelines and streamline its deployment in production environments.", "keywords": ["WaveGlow", "neural vocoder", "audio synthesis", "flow‑based model", "mel‑spectrogram conditioning", "invertible convolution", "WaveNet residual block", "weight‑norm removal", "model export", "speech synthesis"], "summary_hash": "b5bf9ddf6be3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:01:39+00:00"}
