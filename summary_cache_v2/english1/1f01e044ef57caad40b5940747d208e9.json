{"summary": "This module provides a semi‑supervised training pipeline for the InfoGraph graph representation model applied to the QM9 molecular dataset. It defines a custom dataset class that loads dense edge representations of molecules, sets up data loading utilities, and includes helper routines for batching and optional evaluation.", "business_intent": "To demonstrate how to train a graph‑based self‑supervised model on molecular data with limited labeled examples, enabling researchers and developers to apply InfoGraph for property prediction in chemistry and materials science.", "keywords": ["semi-supervised learning", "graph neural networks", "InfoGraph", "QM9 dataset", "molecular property prediction", "DGL", "PyTorch", "dense edge representation", "graph data loading"], "summary_hash": "314f9bcc444b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:21:59+00:00"}
