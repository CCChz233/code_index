{"summary": "This module provides a suite of unit tests for the internal pytest helper utilities used in PlasmaPy. It defines simple helper functions and a collection of test cases that verify the behavior of the run_test and run_test_equivalent_calls functions, including their handling of numerical tolerances, unit-aware quantities, warnings, exceptions, and type mismatches.", "business_intent": "To ensure that the custom pytest helper tools employed throughout the PlasmaPy codebase reliably validate scientific computations, correctly compare results with specified tolerances, manage Astropy units, and enforce proper warning and exception handling, thereby supporting robust automated testing of plasma physics software.", "keywords": ["testing", "pytest", "helper utilities", "run_test", "equivalent calls", "tolerance", "unit handling", "warnings", "exceptions", "type checking", "PlasmaPy"], "summary_hash": "e66158915f24", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:06:40+00:00"}
