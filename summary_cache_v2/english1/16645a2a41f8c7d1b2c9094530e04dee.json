{"summary": "This module implements a diffusion scheduler that leverages trajectory consistency distillation to perform flexible, unrestricted stochastic sampling across diffusion trajectories. It defines a configurable scheduler class handling timestep management, beta schedules, scaling, clipping, and prediction types, and provides the core stepping logic, noise addition, and model input scaling. A lightweight output container captures the results of each scheduler step, and auxiliary helpers generate beta schedules and rescale signal‑to‑noise ratios.", "business_intent": "Enable advanced generative AI pipelines to produce higher‑quality samples by offering a versatile diffusion scheduler that supports trajectory‑consistent stochastic sampling, improving model performance and flexibility in image and media generation tasks.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "trajectory consistency distillation", "stochastic sampling", "beta schedule", "noise scaling", "multistep consistency", "PyTorch", "generative models", "AI image synthesis"], "summary_hash": "6678721da99c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:12:42+00:00"}
