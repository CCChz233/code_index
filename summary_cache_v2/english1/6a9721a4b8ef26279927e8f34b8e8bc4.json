{"summary": "A lightweight wrapper around Python strings that treats characters case‑insensitively for all standard operations. It mimics the built‑in str interface while normalising case for equality, ordering, hashing and membership checks, and supplies convenience helpers for reverse containment, index lookup, lower‑casing and splitting.", "business_intent": "Enable case‑insensitive text handling without altering existing code, simplifying searches, deduplication, sorting and collection usage where string case should be ignored.", "keywords": ["case‑insensitive", "string wrapper", "equality", "ordering", "membership", "hashing", "collection compatibility", "Unicode folding", "helper methods"], "summary_hash": "4ee865acbda3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:53:59+00:00"}
