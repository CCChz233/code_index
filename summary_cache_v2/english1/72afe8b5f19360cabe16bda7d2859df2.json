{"summary": "Implements a PyTorch module that performs E(n)-equivariant graph convolution, generating messages from node features, pairwise distances and optional edge attributes via multilayer perceptrons, aggregating them to update node representations and simultaneously adjusting node coordinates in a distance‑weighted, normalized manner to preserve Euclidean symmetry.", "business_intent": "Provides a building block for constructing equivariant graph neural networks used in scientific and engineering domains such as molecular dynamics, physics simulations, and 3D point‑cloud processing, where respecting rotational and translational invariance is critical.", "keywords": ["equivariant", "graph convolution", "EGNN", "message passing", "node embeddings", "coordinate update", "Euclidean symmetry", "PyTorch", "DGL", "MLP", "edge attributes", "distance weighting"], "summary_hash": "9b3e47782ba6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:45:44+00:00"}
