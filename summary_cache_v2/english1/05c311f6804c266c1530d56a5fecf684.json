{"summary": "The module implements a PyTorch-based skip‑gram model with negative sampling to learn dense vector representations from sequences of graph nodes generated by random walks. It handles efficient forward passes, asynchronous parameter updates, device placement, and provides utilities to export the resulting embeddings in various formats.", "business_intent": "Create high‑quality node embeddings for graph data that can be leveraged in downstream machine‑learning tasks such as node classification, link prediction, or clustering within graph analytics pipelines.", "keywords": ["deepwalk", "skip-gram", "negative sampling", "node embeddings", "graph representation learning", "PyTorch", "asynchronous updates", "embedding export", "OGB"], "summary_hash": "2f9a4b380c35", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:28:04+00:00"}
