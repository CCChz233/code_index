{"summary": "This module provides a collection of utilities that integrate Megatron‑LM models with the Accelerate library. It defines an abstract training‑step interface and concrete implementations for BERT, GPT, and T5 models, a high‑level engine that bundles a Megatron‑LM model with its accelerator, optimizer, and scheduler, wrappers for Megatron‑LM optimizers and learning‑rate schedulers, dummy data‑loader and scheduler components for synthetic runs, and helper functions for distributed loss averaging and GPU tensor gathering.", "business_intent": "To simplify and standardize the training, evaluation, checkpointing, and text‑generation workflows for large language models built with Megatron‑LM, allowing them to be run efficiently on distributed hardware through the Accelerate framework, while also supporting placeholder data pipelines for testing and development.", "keywords": ["megatron-lm", "accelerate", "distributed training", "training step abstraction", "engine wrapper", "optimizer wrapper", "scheduler wrapper", "dummy data loader", "BERT", "GPT", "T5", "loss averaging", "gpu gather"], "summary_hash": "3707647afc22", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:18:19+00:00"}
