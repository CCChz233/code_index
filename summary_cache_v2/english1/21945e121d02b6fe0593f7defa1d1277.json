{"summary": "This module implements a sinusoidal positional embedding component that deterministically generates position‑dependent vectors for sequence data using sine and cosine functions. It integrates with the xformers positional‑embedding registry and produces embeddings during the forward pass based on configurable dimensions and scaling.", "business_intent": "Offer a lightweight, parameter‑free method for encoding positional information in transformer‑style models, enhancing sequence understanding while reducing model size and training overhead.", "keywords": ["sinusoidal", "positional embedding", "deterministic", "transformer", "sequence modeling", "torch", "configuration", "registry"], "summary_hash": "f56e58fe4aca", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:32:15+00:00"}
