{"summary": "Implements the post‑attention processing for a Dinov2 self‑attention block, applying a linear projection and dropout to the attention output. Residual addition and layer‑normalization are performed elsewhere, so this component solely transforms the data before it is merged with the residual path.", "business_intent": "Provide a modular component that prepares self‑attention outputs for integration into the Dinov2 model, ensuring correct projection and regularization while keeping residual handling separate for flexibility.", "keywords": ["Dinov2", "self-attention", "output projection", "dropout", "layer normalization", "residual connection", "transformer", "neural network", "model layer", "forward pass"], "summary_hash": "df232bd19db4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:52:32+00:00"}
