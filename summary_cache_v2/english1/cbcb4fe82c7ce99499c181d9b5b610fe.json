{"summary": "The module provides a utility class that interfaces with Google AI Studio's /batchEmbedContents endpoint to generate text embeddings in bulk. It converts input data from OpenAI‑style structures to Gemini content, sends synchronous or asynchronous HTTP requests, and transforms the service response into Litellm EmbeddingResponse objects.", "business_intent": "Enable Litellm users to obtain large‑scale text embeddings efficiently via Google’s Gemini/Vertex AI service, supporting both sync and async workflows for downstream AI applications such as search, recommendation, and semantic analysis.", "keywords": ["embeddings", "batch processing", "Google AI Studio", "Vertex AI", "Gemini", "async", "sync", "HTTP request", "response transformation", "Litellm integration", "OpenAI compatibility"], "summary_hash": "622c3ea2f0c3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:58:14+00:00"}
