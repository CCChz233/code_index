{"summary": "The class orchestrates a latent diffusion workflow that converts a textual description into an image. It tokenizes and encodes the prompt with a BERT model, conditions a UNet denoiser with this encoding, iteratively refines latent image representations using a scheduler, and finally decodes the latents back to pixel space with a vector‑quantized VAE.", "business_intent": "Enable end‑to‑end AI generation of images from text for creative content, marketing, product visualization, and rapid prototyping.", "keywords": ["latent diffusion", "text-to-image", "BERT encoder", "tokenizer", "UNet denoiser", "scheduler", "VQ‑VAE", "image generation", "AI art", "pipeline"], "summary_hash": "ea581f6150e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:15:13+00:00"}
