{"summary": "An example script that trains a graph classification model using a gated graph neural network with early stopping. It loads a benchmark graph dataset, preprocesses node and edge features, builds a GraphClassifier, and runs training, validation, and testing loops while monitoring performance to stop training when improvement stalls.", "business_intent": "Provide a reproducible reference for developers and researchers to quickly set up and evaluate graph neural network models with early stopping on standard graph classification benchmarks.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "early stopping", "graph classification", "DGL", "PyTorch", "benchmark dataset", "training loop", "validation", "testing", "Gated Graph Neural Network"], "summary_hash": "a77c070cca89", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:18:22+00:00"}
