{"summary": "ImagicStableDiffusionPipeline orchestrates the components of a Stable Diffusion model to perform text‑guided image editing. It encodes input images into latent representations, applies a conditional UNet denoising process driven by a frozen CLIP text encoder and tokenizer, decodes the edited latents back to images, and runs a safety checker on the outputs. The pipeline also provides utilities for training the model.", "business_intent": "Enable businesses and creators to generate or modify visual content from textual prompts, supporting marketing, design, and product visualization workflows while automatically filtering potentially unsafe imagery.", "keywords": ["image editing", "stable diffusion", "text-to-image", "latent diffusion", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "safety checker", "CLIP", "pipeline", "training helper", "content generation", "creative AI"], "summary_hash": "c92ca873fdf7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:03:37+00:00"}
