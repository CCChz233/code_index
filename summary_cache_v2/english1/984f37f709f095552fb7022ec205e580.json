{"summary": "The module implements a highly configurable UNet‑style network for image segmentation. It provides a registry for interchangeable encoder backbones that must produce progressively down‑sampled feature maps, a decoder that reconstructs spatial resolution via up‑sampling and concatenation, and a segmentation head that maps the final features to class logits with optional scaling and activation.", "business_intent": "Offer an extensible, plug‑and‑play UNet implementation that can be tailored to diverse medical imaging modalities and research experiments, reducing development effort when swapping encoders or adjusting network depth and channel sizes.", "keywords": ["UNet", "encoder‑decoder", "segmentation", "flexible architecture", "backbone registry", "medical imaging", "PyTorch", "MONAI", "configurable depth", "feature scaling"], "summary_hash": "07bb671859b1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:16:41+00:00"}
