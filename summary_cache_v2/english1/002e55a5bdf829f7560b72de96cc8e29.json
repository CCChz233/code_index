{"summary": "This module defines a configurable neural autoencoder for raw audio signals. It provides an encoder that maps waveforms to a latent Gaussian distribution and a decoder that reconstructs waveforms from those latents. The architecture includes hierarchical encoder and decoder blocks, residual units that combine snake activations with weight‑normalized dilated convolutions, and utilities for handling diagonal Gaussian distributions and output containers. The model integrates generic utilities for saving, loading, and interfacing with diffusion pipelines.", "business_intent": "To supply a trainable audio compression and generation component that can be incorporated into diffusion‑based speech or music synthesis systems, enabling efficient encoding, latent manipulation, and high‑quality reconstruction of audio.", "keywords": ["audio autoencoder", "latent representation", "encoder", "decoder", "residual block", "snake activation", "diagonal Gaussian distribution", "diffusion model", "speech synthesis", "audio compression", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "4d883a56a82e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:29:52+00:00"}
