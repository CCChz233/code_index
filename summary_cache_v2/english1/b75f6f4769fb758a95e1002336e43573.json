{"summary": "This module implements a comprehensive prostate cancer disease model for a population health simulation. It defines events for diagnostic investigations triggered by pelvic pain, urinary symptoms, or positive PSA results, manages treatment initiation, palliative care, and post‑treatment follow‑up, and periodically updates disease status, progression, symptom onset, and mortality. The core class orchestrates population setup, parameter loading, event scheduling, and outcome reporting such as DALYs, while auxiliary logging captures module‑specific events.", "business_intent": "To provide a realistic, configurable prostate cancer component that can be integrated into health system simulations for evaluating disease burden, screening strategies, treatment pathways, and resource allocation decisions.", "keywords": ["prostate cancer", "disease simulation", "population health model", "diagnostic investigation", "PSA testing", "pelvic pain", "urinary symptoms", "treatment initiation", "palliative care", "disease progression", "DALYs", "health outcomes", "event-driven simulation", "symptom management"], "summary_hash": "b8b547365ded", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:49:38+00:00"}
