{"summary": "This module implements a scheduler tailored for the RePaint diffusion inpainting algorithm. It manages timestep configuration, beta schedules, noise injection, sample clipping, input scaling, and iterative state updates while respecting a user-provided mask. It also defines a lightweight output container for each diffusion step and includes a helper to derive beta values from a target alpha schedule.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to perform high‑quality image inpainting using diffusion models by providing a ready‑to‑use scheduler that orchestrates the RePaint process, handling mask‑aware generation and integration with existing DDPM pipelines.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "inpainting", "scheduler", "RePaint", "beta schedule", "timestep", "noise injection", "mask handling", "DDPM", "PyTorch", "dataclass"], "summary_hash": "6bf5fbcf03cc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:13:37+00:00"}
