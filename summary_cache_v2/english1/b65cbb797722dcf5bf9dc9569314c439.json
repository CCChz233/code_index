{"summary": "This module defines a suite of client‑side network protocol classes for JoinMarket and related services. It implements the BIP78 payment protocol client, generic client utilities, and specific JM client protocols for makers, takers, and SNICKER interactions. Each protocol manages connections, processes messages such as offers, signatures, status updates, hidden‑service details, and error conditions, while accompanying factory classes handle their instantiation.", "business_intent": "To provide JoinMarket clients with the networking layer required to negotiate coinjoin offers, execute the BIP78 payment flow, and interact with privacy‑preserving services like SNICKER, thereby automating transaction coordination, signature exchange, and status monitoring in a secure and resilient manner.", "keywords": ["JoinMarket", "client protocol", "BIP78", "payment protocol", "network communication", "offer exchange", "transaction signing", "SNICKER", "hidden service", "factory pattern", "Twisted", "cryptocurrency", "coinjoin", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "9a0f773fa5b6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:18:47+00:00"}
