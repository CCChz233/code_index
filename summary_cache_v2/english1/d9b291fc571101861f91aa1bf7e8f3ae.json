{"summary": "The module implements a suite of control‑flow primitives for Qiskit circuits, including conditional branches, classical loops (for, while), switch/case dispatch, and early‑exit statements (break, continue). It provides abstract base classes, builders, context managers, and placeholder mechanisms that automatically manage qubit and classical‑bit resources across nested subcircuits, ensuring consistent scope and validation of conditions.", "business_intent": "To give quantum algorithm developers expressive, high‑level constructs for embedding classical control logic directly into quantum circuits, simplifying circuit composition, readability, and downstream compilation while preserving correct resource accounting.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "control flow", "conditional execution", "loop constructs", "if‑else", "for loop", "while loop", "break statement", "continue statement", "switch case", "resource tracking", "placeholder", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "73c8405fb336", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:06:50+00:00"}
