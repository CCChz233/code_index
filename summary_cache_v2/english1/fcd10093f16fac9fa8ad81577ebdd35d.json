{"summary": "A lazy‑evaluated quantum circuit blueprint that can construct its internal representation on demand once all required configuration (such as qubit count) is known. It mimics a regular circuit with indexing, length, composition, copying, analysis (depth, size, parameters, connectivity) and conversion to gates or instructions, automatically invoking a build step to validate and materialize the circuit", "business_intent": "Enable developers to pass around circuit templates without needing full specification, allowing dynamic construction, reuse, and manipulation of quantum circuits in applications such as circuit optimization, compilation, or runtime generation.", "keywords": ["blueprint", "lazy construction", "quantum circuit", "deferred building", "composition", "copy", "depth analysis", "parameter handling", "gate conversion", "instruction conversion", "circuit decomposition", "connectivity", "nonlocal gates", "size measurement", "quantum registers"], "summary_hash": "a9b7ac30fba5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:09:13+00:00"}
