{"summary": "A configurable diffusion UNet model enhanced with ControlNet functionality that processes latent inputs together with optional conditioning images, time and class embeddings, and cross‑attention to encoder states. It assembles customizable down‑sampling, middle, and up‑sampling blocks with flexible channel dimensions, attention heads, activation and normalization options to output denoised latents for each diffusion step.", "business_intent": "Enable versatile text‑to‑image or image‑to‑image generation pipelines that require precise control via additional conditioning signals, supporting creative content creation, visual editing, and AI‑assisted design applications.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "controlnet", "conditioning", "cross‑attention", "UNet", "time embedding", "image generation", "neural network", "configurable architecture"], "summary_hash": "af9718ab7cf4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:37:20+00:00"}
