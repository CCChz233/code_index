{"summary": "The module implements robust version handling compliant with PEP 440. It defines an immutable version object that parses a version string into its constituent parts (epoch, release segment, pre‑release, post‑release, development release, and local identifier) and provides rich comparison, equality, and hashing behavior. An exception type signals malformed version strings, and a base class supplies common ordering logic for derived version entities.", "business_intent": "Enable Metaflow's packaging utilities to reliably parse, validate, and compare software version identifiers, ensuring consistent dependency resolution and release management across the platform.", "keywords": ["version parsing", "PEP 440", "semantic versioning", "immutable version object", "comparison", "ordering", "invalid version handling", "packaging", "dependency management"], "summary_hash": "d6e4cf61c6af", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:19:04+00:00"}
