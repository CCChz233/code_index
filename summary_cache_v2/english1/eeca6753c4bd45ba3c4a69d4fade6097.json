{"summary": "Implements a high‑level pipeline that converts textual prompts into images using a diffusion model. The class orchestrates tokenization, text encoding, latent preparation, stochastic noise addition, iterative denoising with a UNet, and final decoding through a VAE to produce PIL images.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑use example for developers and researchers to integrate text‑to‑image diffusion capabilities into applications, accelerating prototyping and product development of AI‑generated visual content.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "text-to-image", "pipeline", "latent space", "scheduler", "UNet", "VAE", "tokenizer", "CLIP", "image generation", "AI"], "summary_hash": "a05116b26cd1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:02:20+00:00"}
