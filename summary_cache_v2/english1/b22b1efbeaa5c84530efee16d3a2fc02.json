{"summary": "The script evaluates a pretrained Transformer language model as a rescoring component for automatic speech recognition. It reads beam hypothesis files, aligns them with reference transcripts from a manifest, tokenizes the text, computes word error rates, and searches for optimal interpolation weights (alpha, beta) to combine the neural LM scores with existing scores, reporting the resulting WER.", "business_intent": "To enhance ASR system performance by leveraging a neural language model for rescoring beam outputs, enabling quantitative assessment of the rescoring impact and selection of optimal weighting parameters.", "keywords": ["ASR", "neural language model", "Transformer", "rescoring", "beam search", "WER", "evaluation", "tokenization", "alpha beta weighting", "NeMo", "language modeling"], "summary_hash": "87f18af16fc8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:51:54+00:00"}
