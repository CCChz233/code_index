{"summary": "Implements a server that loads a graph partition and exposes its structure, node attributes, and edge attributes through an RPC service so that trainer and sampler processes can read the data remotely. Each instance manages a single partition, supports main and backup instances sharing data via shared memory, and can operate without shared memory for cross‑machine deployments.", "business_intent": "Facilitates large‑scale distributed graph learning by providing reliable, low‑latency access to partitioned graph data for multiple training and sampling clients across a cluster.", "keywords": ["distributed graph", "partitioned data", "RPC service", "shared memory", "backup server", "graph training", "graph sampling", "scalable graph processing"], "summary_hash": "e6d10516ff27", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:41:10+00:00"}
