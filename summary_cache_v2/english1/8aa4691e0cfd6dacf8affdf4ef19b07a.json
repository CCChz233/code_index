{"summary": "The module defines a DPMSolver class that implements a numerical solver for diffusion probabilistic models, providing functions to predict data and noise, perform denoising updates, and generate samples using first-order and multistep integration schemes. It also defines a NoiseScheduleVP class that encapsulates mathematical utilities for variance‑preserving diffusion noise schedule, offering calculations of marginal coefficients, standard deviations, and inverse transformations needed to map between time steps and noise levels. Additionally, the module includes several helper functions for gradient computation, model input handling, and noise prediction.", "business_intent": "The module aims to provide an efficient and accurate sampling method for diffusion models used in text‑to‑image generation, enabling faster generation of high‑quality images while reducing computational overhead.", "keywords": ["diffusion probabilistic models", "DPMSolver", "NoiseScheduleVP", "stable diffusion", "sampler", "numerical solver", "multistep integration", "image generation", "text‑to‑image", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "5f6d605c4e01", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:06:02+00:00"}
