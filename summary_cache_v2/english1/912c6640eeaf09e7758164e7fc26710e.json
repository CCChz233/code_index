{"summary": "This module implements support for NumPy generalized universal functions (gufuncs) within Dask arrays. It defines a gufunc class that parses gufunc signatures, validates axes, and orchestrates blockwise computation across Dask's high‑level graph infrastructure, allowing complex NumPy operations to be executed lazily and in parallel on distributed or out‑of‑core arrays.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, parallel execution layer for advanced NumPy gufunc operations on large datasets, enabling scientific and data‑intensive applications to leverage Dask's distributed array capabilities without rewriting existing NumPy code.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "gufunc", "generalized universal function", "blockwise", "parallel computation", "NumPy", "signature parsing", "lazy evaluation", "distributed computing"], "summary_hash": "0c75307bad4a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:17:53+00:00"}
