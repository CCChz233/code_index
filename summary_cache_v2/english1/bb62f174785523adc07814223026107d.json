{"summary": "This module defines a plugin system and a transformation pass for high‑level synthesis in the Qiskit transpiler. It supplies configurable synthesis strategies for abstract quantum objects such as Clifford operators, linear functions, and permutation gates, and uses these plugins to replace annotated operations and custom gates in a circuit DAG with primitive gate sequences that respect a target device’s connectivity and gate set.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, configurable way to translate high‑level mathematical descriptions of quantum operations into hardware‑compatible gate sequences, optimizing for metrics like gate count and depth while handling different qubit connectivity constraints, thereby streamlining the compilation of quantum programs for execution on real devices.", "keywords": ["high-level synthesis", "quantum transpilation", "gate decomposition", "Clifford synthesis", "linear function synthesis", "permutation synthesis", "plugin architecture", "connectivity constraints", "circuit optimization", "quantum compilation"], "summary_hash": "b85a71dc12c2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:25:51+00:00"}
