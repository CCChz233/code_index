{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have multiple scripts in the snicker folder. The module_path is scripts/snicker. So we need to summarize the overall purpose of the module (the collection of scripts). Provide business intent: what business problem it solves. Provide keywords.\n\nLet's analyze each script:\n\n- create-snicker-proposal.py: CLI utility that assembles a mixing proposal for the SNICKER network, attaches proof-of-work, sends to SNICKER servers using JoinMarket client services.\n\n- receive-snicker.py: CLI utility that sets up a JoinMarket wallet and runs a SNICKER receiver service to accept incoming SNICKER payments, handling config, options, reactor lifecycle.\n\n- snicker-finder.py: CLI utility that scans Bitcoin blockchain for transactions matching criteria (\"snicker\" candidates), logs findings, optionally writes candidate data to file for later processing.\n\n- snicker-recovery.py: CLI utility that builds and broadcasts a recovery transaction for a JoinMarket wallet, extracting public keys and input indices from ancestor and current inputs to reconstruct spendable outputs.\n\n- snicker-seed-tx.py: CLI utility that constructs a Bitcoin transaction to seed a JoinMarket wallet, selecting inputs, estimating fees, optionally broadcasting.\n\n- snicker-server.py: Twisted-based web server that runs as a Tor hidden service. Stores incoming proposals in SQLite DB, accepts them via POST in base64 with proof-of-work, returns list of stored proposals on GET. Handles creation of persistent or ephemeral onion endpoints and clean shutdown.\n\nOverall, this module implements the SNICKER network utilities for mixing proposals, receiving payments, scanning blockchain for candidates, recovery, seeding, and a server for proposals. It integrates with JoinMarket (a Bitcoin mixing service) and uses Tor hidden services for anonymity. Business intent: Provide privacy-enhancing Bitcoin mixing service (SNICKER) with proposal handling, payment receiving, candidate discovery, wallet recovery, and seeding, leveraging JoinMarket and Tor.\n\nKeywords: Bitcoin, mixing, privacy, JoinMarket, SNICKER, Tor hidden service, proof-of-work, blockchain scanning, transaction recovery, seed transaction, proposal server, SQLite, Twisted, command-line utilities.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed to avoid listing function names verbatim. That's fine.\n\nProvide summary: \"The snicker package provides a suite of command‑line tools and a Tor‑based server that enable creation, submission, receipt, discovery, and management of mixing proposals for the SNICKER privacy network built on top of Join", "business_intent": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have multiple scripts in the snicker folder.
