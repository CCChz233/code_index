{"summary": "Defines a concrete job class used by Qiskit's primitive interfaces to submit, monitor, and retrieve the results of quantum primitive computations. It handles job identification, asynchronous execution via a thread pool, status transitions, and error propagation.", "business_intent": "Provide a unified, easy‑to‑use job abstraction for quantum primitive operations so that developers and end‑users can launch primitive tasks, track their progress, and obtain results in a consistent manner within the Qiskit ecosystem.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "primitive", "job", "asynchronous execution", "thread pool", "status tracking", "result retrieval", "UUID", "error handling", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "221a0839c8b2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:54:39+00:00"}
