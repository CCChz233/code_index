{"summary": "The module defines a readout error mitigation class that models each qubit independently using a 2×2 assignment matrix per qubit. It can be calibrated from experimental counts or backend calibration data and applies the local tensor product of these matrices to correct raw measurement results, yielding adjusted expectation values and quasi‑probability distributions with a computational cost that scales as O(2^N).", "business_intent": "Enable quantum computing users to reduce measurement errors in their experiments by providing an easy‑to‑use, per‑qubit readout correction tool that improves the reliability of expectation values and probability estimates without requiring full‑system tomography.", "keywords": ["readout error mitigation", "local tensor product", "assignment matrix", "calibration", "expectation value correction", "quasi‑probability distribution", "per‑qubit correction", "quantum measurement", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "384638049998", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:01:48+00:00"}
