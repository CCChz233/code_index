{"summary": "Provides an internal representation of a quantum circuit as a directed acyclic graph that captures non‑commutation dependencies between operations. The class builds the graph from circuit instructions, incorporates registers and calibrations, and offers queries for structural metrics such as depth, width, ancestors, successors, and topological ordering.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate analysis and optimization of quantum circuits by modeling operation ordering constraints, facilitating scheduling, validation, and transformation processes within the Qiskit framework.", "keywords": ["DAG", "dependency graph", "quantum circuit", "non-commutation", "depth", "width", "topological order", "ancestors", "successors", "registers", "calibrations", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "45b6faa13fba", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:51:44+00:00"}
