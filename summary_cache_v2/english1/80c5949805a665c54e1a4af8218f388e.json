{"summary": "The feedforward package defines a registry and factory for interchangeable feed‑forward modules used in transformer architectures, offering a base configurable component and concrete implementations such as a standard MLP, a convolution‑based MLP for vision models, and a mixture‑of‑experts layer that routes inputs to multiple expert networks.", "business_intent": "Provide a modular, extensible way to plug different feed‑forward designs into transformer models, allowing developers to experiment with and scale various architectures (standard, vision‑oriented, or expert‑based) without rewriting core model code.", "keywords": ["feedforward", "transformer", "MLP", "convolutional MLP", "mixture of experts", "registry", "factory", "configurable", "PyTorch", "xformers"], "summary_hash": "834001530770", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:34:52+00:00"}
