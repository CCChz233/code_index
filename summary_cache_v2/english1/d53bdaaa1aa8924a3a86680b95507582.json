{"summary": "Internal helper class that models how a single dimension is broken into consecutive blocks of varying lengths. It records the longest and shortest block sizes, the cumulative start positions both as a Python list and as a PyTorch integer tensor, and offers utilities to generate the structure from a list of lengths, compute interval ranges, partition tensors according to the blocks, and move the stored tensor to a different device or dtype.", "business_intent": "Facilitate efficient handling of variable‑length sequences in batch operations, enabling fast indexing, slicing, and device placement for downstream neural‑network processing.", "keywords": ["sequence partitioning", "block lengths", "cumulative start indices", "PyTorch tensor", "internal utility", "variable-length sequences", "batch processing"], "summary_hash": "42d18eecbe39", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:22:53+00:00"}
