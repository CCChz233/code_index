{"summary": "Manages a sequence of compilation stages, each encapsulated by a PassManager, to transform quantum circuits from a high‑level description to a backend‑compatible form. It enforces a default ordering of stages (initialization, layout, routing, translation, optimization, scheduling), supports pre‑ and post‑hooks for each stage, and provides utilities to add, replace, or remove entire stages while preserving compatibility with the overall transpilation flow.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, modular framework for constructing and executing quantum circuit transpilation pipelines, allowing developers and users to customize compilation stages, inject additional processing, and maintain a stable, extensible workflow for preparing circuits for execution on diverse quantum hardware.", "keywords": ["quantum transpilation", "pass manager", "staged pipeline", "compilation stages", "layout", "routing", "optimization", "scheduling", "modular composition", "stage replacement", "flow controller"], "summary_hash": "b209d11612af", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:55:29+00:00"}
