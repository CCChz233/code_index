{"summary": "Defines the FavorAttention class, a custom attention mechanism that computes causal attention, optionally promotes tensor dimensions, and integrates with the xformers attention framework via registration. The module imports necessary utilities, feature‑map types, and registers the attention implementation for use in transformer models.", "business_intent": "Provide a performant and flexible attention component for deep‑learning models, enabling causal (autoregressive) attention with optional tensor reshaping to improve efficiency in transformer‑based applications such as language modeling, generation, and other sequence tasks.", "keywords": ["attention", "causal attention", "transformer", "feature map", "SMHyperbolic", "SMOrf", "SMReg", "PyTorch", "xformers", "neural network", "dimension promotion", "register_attention"], "summary_hash": "ba8a09d54c83", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:31:42+00:00"}
