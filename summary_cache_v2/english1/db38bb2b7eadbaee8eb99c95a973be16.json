{"summary": "Implements a Home Assistant sensor platform that connects to the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) service. It validates configuration, creates sensor entities for configured locations or stations, periodically retrieves air‑quality data via asynchronous HTTP calls, parses pollutant and environmental measurements, and exposes them as sensor attributes such as PM2.5, PM10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, temperature, humidity, pressure, and the dominant pollutant.", "business_intent": "Provide Home Assistant users with real‑time outdoor air‑quality monitoring, enabling dashboards and automations that react to pollutant levels and related environmental conditions.", "keywords": ["air quality", "WAQI", "sensor", "Home Assistant", "API", "asynchronous HTTP", "pollutants", "PM2.5", "PM10", "ozone", "nitrogen dioxide", "sulfur dioxide", "temperature", "humidity", "pressure", "dominant pollutant"], "summary_hash": "586c05982fd1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:04:10+00:00"}
