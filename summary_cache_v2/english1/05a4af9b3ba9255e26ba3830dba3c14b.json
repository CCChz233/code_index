{"summary": "Provides a command‑line utility that reads a CSV file containing ASR experiment results, filters and groups the data by dataset type and experiment category, computes word‑error‑rate (WER) metrics, compares against baseline values, and presents the best or top‑k hyperparameter configurations. It supports both adapter‑based and fine‑tuning experiments, allows constrained or unconstrained hyperparameter selection, and can display detailed analysis tables.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and engineers to quickly evaluate and compare the performance of different ASR adapter and fine‑tuning configurations, identify optimal hyperparameters, and assess degradation relative to baseline systems.", "keywords": ["CSV analysis", "ASR experiment evaluation", "adapter hyperparameters", "fine‑tuning results", "WER calculation", "baseline comparison", "top‑k ranking", "command‑line tool", "result scoring", "hyperparameter selection"], "summary_hash": "b2d121b0ea0c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:39:21+00:00"}
