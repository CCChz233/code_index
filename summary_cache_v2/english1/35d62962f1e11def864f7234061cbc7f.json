{"summary": "The module implements a TCP proxy that intercepts, buffers, and forwards network traffic, primarily targeting Kerberos (KRB5) authentication messages. It defines connection wrappers, a factory for creating intercepted connections, and a server that listens for incoming connections. Helper functions parse command‑line arguments and provide utilities for handling specific Kerberos structures, though some are currently unused.", "business_intent": "To provide a tool for security analysts or penetration testers to capture, inspect, and potentially modify Kerberos authentication exchanges in order to assess or exploit authentication mechanisms.", "keywords": ["Kerberos", "TCP proxy", "network interception", "authentication", "ticket manipulation", "security testing", "packet capture", "asyncore", "S4U2Self", "TGS request"], "summary_hash": "3d0292d405c0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:14:04+00:00"}
