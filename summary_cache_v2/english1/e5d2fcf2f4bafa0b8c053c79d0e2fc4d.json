{"summary": "A training script that prepares the MS MARCO dataset, configures a SentenceTransformer bi-encoder, and optimizes it using a margin‑based mean‑squared‑error loss. It manages data loading, model initialization, training loops, evaluation, and checkpointing to produce a dense retrieval model.", "business_intent": "To develop and fine‑tune a high‑performance dense retrieval model for question‑answering or search applications, enhancing relevance ranking on large‑scale text corpora such as MS MARCO.", "keywords": ["bi-encoder", "MS MARCO", "margin MSE loss", "dense retrieval", "sentence transformers", "training script", "PyTorch", "model checkpointing", "information retrieval", "neural ranking"], "summary_hash": "1622f20f7934", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:58:21+00:00"}
