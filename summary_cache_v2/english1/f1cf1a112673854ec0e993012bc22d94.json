{"summary": "XPOTrainer orchestrates the training of a causal language model using the eXtreme Preference Optimization (XPO) framework. It coordinates the main model, optional reference and reward models, and a pairwise judge, handling dataset preparation, generation of model completions, calculation of log‑probabilities, rewards, and loss components, and performing the optimization step while logging metrics and supporting evaluation.", "business_intent": "Provide a streamlined solution for fine‑tuning large language models to align with human preferences through preference‑based reinforcement learning, reducing reliance on handcrafted reward functions and accelerating the deployment of safer, more useful AI systems.", "keywords": ["model fine‑tuning", "preference optimization", "reward modeling", "pairwise comparison", "XPO trainer", "reinforcement learning", "language model alignment", "PEFT support", "evaluation metrics", "logging"], "summary_hash": "19a239e9257a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:00:01+00:00"}
