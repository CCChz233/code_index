A regular grid of control points is randomly displaced within a configurable range, and a continuous deformation field is computed and applied uniformly to all targets.", "business_intent": "Enhance model robustness by augmenting training data with realistic elastic distortions, helping computer‑vision systems handle variations in object shape and pose.", "keywords": ["thin plate spline", "elastic deformation", "non‑rigid warping", "data augmentation", "smooth interpolation", "control point grid", "random displacement", "computer vision", "image transformation", "augmentation robustness"], "summary_hash": "a384ac76eb51", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:26:08+00:00"}
