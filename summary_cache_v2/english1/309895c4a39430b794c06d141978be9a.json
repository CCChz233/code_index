{"summary": "Implements the Quantum Shannon Decomposition to transform any unitary matrix into a Qiskit QuantumCircuit using elementary gates. Provides recursive utilities for multiplexed rotations, controlled‑U constructions, and combines one‑ and two‑qubit decomposers to produce circuits built from CX, UCRY, UCRZ and related primitives.", "business_intent": "Allows developers and researchers to automatically synthesize executable quantum circuits from arbitrary unitary operators, supporting circuit design, compilation, and simulation workflows in quantum computing projects.", "keywords": ["Quantum Shannon Decomposition", "unitary synthesis", "circuit decomposition", "Qiskit", "controlled-U", "multiplexed rotations", "CX gate", "UCRY", "UCRZ", "recursive algorithm"], "summary_hash": "533af9c9ee0c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:04:16+00:00"}
