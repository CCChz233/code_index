{"summary": "Implements an inverted residual block from MobileNetV2, consisting of an optional expansion via 1x1 convolution, a depthwise convolution with configurable stride, and a projection 1x1 convolution that restores the channel dimension. The block supports residual connections when input and output dimensions match and stride equals one.", "business_intent": "Provides a computationally efficient building unit for lightweight convolutional neural networks targeting mobile and edge devices, enabling fast image classification and feature extraction with reduced memory and power consumption.", "keywords": ["MobileNetV2", "inverted residual", "depthwise separable convolution", "expansion ratio", "lightweight CNN", "mobile inference", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "1053be15eaf7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:48:05+00:00"}
