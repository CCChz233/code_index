{"summary": "Encapsulates the AM RDF dataset, downloading and preprocessing raw files to construct a DGL graph for node classification. It parses entity and relation URIs, builds directed edges (optionally adding reverse edges), stores label masks for training and testing, and exposes dataset metadata such as the target node category and number of classes through a standard dataset interface.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use, preprocessed graph dataset that can be directly fed into graph neural network pipelines for evaluating node classification models on the AM collection.", "keywords": ["node classification", "RDF", "graph dataset", "DGL", "reverse edges", "train/test split", "label masks", "preprocessing", "graph neural networks"], "summary_hash": "840a4536237b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:45:13+00:00"}
