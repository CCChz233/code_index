{"summary": "This module implements a training pipeline for the Wuerstchen prior diffusion model that learns to map textual descriptions to image latent representations. It handles argument parsing, dataset loading and preprocessing, tokenization, model and optimizer setup, distributed training with Accelerate, learning rate scheduling, periodic validation, checkpointing, and optional model card creation.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to train a high‑quality text‑to‑image prior model, facilitating the generation of realistic images from natural language prompts within the Wuerstchen diffusion framework.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "diffusion prior", "model training", "accelerate", "dataset preprocessing", "tokenization", "learning rate scheduler", "checkpointing", "validation", "Wuerstchen", "HuggingFace", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "669be17000a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:08:42+00:00"}
