{"summary": "Provides a high‑level pipeline that generates images from textual prompts using the Stable Diffusion XL model, augmented with ControlNet conditioning and optional adapter modules (LoRA, textual inversion, IP‑Adapter). It orchestrates prompt encoding, image preprocessing, latent preparation, guidance scaling, denoising via the UNet, VAE decoding, watermarking, and scheduler integration.", "business_intent": "Empowers developers and creators to produce customized, high‑fidelity images from text with fine‑grained control and extensible adapters, supporting rapid prototyping, content creation, and integration into AI‑driven visual applications.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion XL", "ControlNet", "text-to-image generation", "diffusion pipeline", "adapter modules", "LoRA", "IP‑Adapter", "textual inversion", "UNet denoiser", "VAE decoder", "scheduler", "watermarking"], "summary_hash": "6f754b62bccc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:40:17+00:00"}
