{"summary": "The PhaseGate class implements a single‑qubit diagonal gate that rotates the quantum state about the Z axis by a configurable angle λ. It is represented by the matrix diag(1, e^{iλ}) and can be applied virtually with zero error and duration, making it an efficient building block for quantum circuits.", "business_intent": "Provide a parameterized, hardware‑friendly phase rotation gate that can be inserted into quantum circuits for algorithm design, error‑free virtual Z operations, and compatibility with other Qiskit components.", "keywords": ["quantum gate", "phase rotation", "Z axis", "diagonal", "virtual gate", "zero error", "single-qubit", "parameterized", "Qiskit", "quantum circuit"], "summary_hash": "4acbdf9d1998", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:31:57+00:00"}
