{"summary": "The module defines a suite of Pydantic models that represent the request payloads for creating and updating resources via the Prefect REST API, covering artifacts, blocks, deployments, flows, runs, logs, variables, work pools, queues, concurrency limits, and related entities. It also provides lightweight validation helpers for keys and names, ensuring payloads conform to expected schemas before transmission.", "business_intent": "To provide a typed, validated, and serializable representation of API actions so that client code can reliably construct, validate, and send correct request bodies to the Prefect server, reducing errors and simplifying integration.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "REST API", "schemas", "actions", "create", "update", "Pydantic", "validation", "payload", "deployment", "flow", "run", "artifact", "block", "concurrency limit", "variable", "work pool", "work queue", "log", "state", "task run", "notification policy", "saved search"], "summary_hash": "0574383aaab3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:54:53+00:00"}
