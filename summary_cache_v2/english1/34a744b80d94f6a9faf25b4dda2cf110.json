{"summary": "The module defines data structures and a processor for handling the SQuAD question‑answering dataset. It loads JSON files, extracts contexts, questions, and answer spans, normalizes text, tokenizes using BERT utilities, and creates example objects suitable for training, evaluation, or inference within the NeMo NLP framework. It also provides helper routines for computing exact‑match and F1 scores, optimizing answerability thresholds, and post‑processing predicted answer spans.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the preparation, preprocessing, and evaluation of SQuAD‑style QA data for building and assessing neural question‑answering models in a production‑ready NLP pipeline.", "keywords": ["SQuAD", "question answering", "data preprocessing", "tokenization", "evaluation metrics", "exact match", "F1 score", "threshold optimization", "unanswerable questions", "NeMo", "NLP"], "summary_hash": "954eb9aaad87", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:27:03+00:00"}
