{"summary": "Provides a PyTorch 2‑D convolution layer that enforces causality by masking the kernel so each output location can only use input pixels from the same row or earlier rows and from the same column or earlier columns, effectively preventing access to rightward or downward positions. The layer retains the same API as nn.Conv2d, with padding handled internally to preserve the causal constraint.", "business_intent": "Facilitates autoregressive or sequential deep‑learning models on two‑dimensional data (e.g., image generation, video frame prediction, spatiotemporal forecasting) where future information must be excluded from the receptive field.", "keywords": ["causal convolution", "2D", "nn.Conv2d", "autoregressive", "masking", "PyTorch", "deep learning", "spatiotemporal", "image generation"], "summary_hash": "f00be9367118", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:30:10+00:00"}
