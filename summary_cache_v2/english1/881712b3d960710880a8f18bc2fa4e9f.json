{"summary": "Implements a quantum feature map that encodes each input dimension into a Z‑rotation on a separate qubit. The circuit consists of a Hadamard gate followed by a parameter‑dependent U1 rotation for each qubit, repeated as specified, without any entangling operations.", "business_intent": "Provides a lightweight, first‑order data encoding primitive for quantum machine‑learning models, allowing users to map classical feature vectors onto quantum states with minimal circuit depth.", "keywords": ["quantum feature map", "Pauli Z", "data encoding", "Qiskit", "non‑entangling", "parameterized rotation", "machine learning"], "summary_hash": "dc1d80e49963", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:37:31+00:00"}
