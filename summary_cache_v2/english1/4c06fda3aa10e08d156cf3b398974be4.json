{"summary": "The module implements a SPADE‑based generative architecture comprising an encoder, a decoder, and a full network that converts semantic label maps (and optionally latent style vectors) into high‑resolution images. It provides configurable convolutional parameters, up‑sampling blocks, spatially‑adaptive normalization, and activation layers, supporting both GAN‑style generation and VAE‑based synthesis.", "business_intent": "Enable advanced medical image synthesis and data augmentation by translating segmentation maps into realistic images, facilitating research, training of downstream models, and potential clinical decision support.", "keywords": ["SPADE", "image synthesis", "semantic label maps", "latent style vector", "variational autoencoder", "generative adversarial network", "up‑sampling", "spatially adaptive normalization", "PyTorch", "MONAI", "residual block"], "summary_hash": "d0f866c822ac", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:17:00+00:00"}
