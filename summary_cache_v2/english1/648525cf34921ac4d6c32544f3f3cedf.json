{"summary": "This module supplies utilities to generate and manage randomly sampled camera poses for neural radiance field (NeRF) training. It implements an iterable dataset that yields pose batches, supports batch collation, and allows progressive updating of view parameters. Helper functions provide linear normalization and various strategies for sampling poses on orbits or uniformly over a sphere.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient creation of synthetic view data to train and refine NeRF models for 3D scene reconstruction and rendering, facilitating scalable and progressive pose generation within the NeMo multimodal framework.", "keywords": ["NeRF", "random camera poses", "iterable dataset", "pose sampling", "view direction", "ray generation", "3D reconstruction", "computer vision", "progressive training", "multimodal data"], "summary_hash": "ec90a83c5f52", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:04:44+00:00"}
