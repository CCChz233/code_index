{"summary": "The core package supplies the infrastructure for CuPy's operation‑fusion system and synchronization safety. It offers proxy objects that capture array and scalar expressions, utilities to emit and format CUDA source fragments, mechanisms to infer types and assemble fused elementwise and reduction kernels, and tools to normalize and optimize the resulting operation graphs. Additionally, it includes helpers to detect and control illegal GPU synchronization events.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑performance numerical computing on NVIDIA GPUs by automatically merging multiple array operations into a single CUDA kernel, thereby reducing memory traffic and launch overhead, while safeguarding against unintended device synchronizations.", "keywords": ["GPU", "CUDA", "kernel generation", "operation fusion", "code emission", "optimization", "synchronization detection", "CuPy", "elementwise", "reduction", "proxy objects", "expression tree"], "summary_hash": "2486e99ff535", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:34:56+00:00"}
