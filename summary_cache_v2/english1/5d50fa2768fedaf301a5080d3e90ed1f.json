{"summary": "This module contains unit tests for the structured exchange creator used in MODFLOW 6 multimodel simulations. It constructs submodel partitions, invokes the exchange creation logic, and verifies that cell identifiers, exchange counts, and geometric properties are correctly generated.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness of exchange generation between submodels in a groundwater modeling framework, ensuring reliable coupling and accurate representation of inter-model flow.", "keywords": ["testing", "exchange creation", "structured model", "MODFLOW 6", "multimodel", "submodel partition", "cell identifiers", "geometric attributes", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "d7c7e6c7d333", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:59:56+00:00"}
