{"summary": "The module defines a suite of helper utilities that build synthetic allocation, distribution, and boundary‑condition datasets for the topsystem preparation component. These helpers create varied configurations (elevation‑based, first‑active‑layer, transmissivity‑based, thickness‑based, cross‑cut, layer‑based, equal distribution, etc.) and generate structured or unstructured representations of drains, general head boundaries, recharge, and rivers, which are then used as parametrized test cases.", "business_intent": "To enable thorough and automated testing of the topsystem preparation logic by providing a rich set of predefined scenarios that cover multiple allocation and distribution strategies and different types of boundary condition data.", "keywords": ["testing", "groundwater modeling", "allocation strategies", "distribution methods", "boundary conditions", "synthetic data generation", "pytest_cases", "helper functions", "topsystem preparation", "parameterized tests"], "summary_hash": "35d980a6ef6b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:55:24+00:00"}
