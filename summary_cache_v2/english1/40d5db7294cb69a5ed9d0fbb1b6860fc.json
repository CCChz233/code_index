{"summary": "This module implements a transform that programmatically renders text onto images. It selects random bounding boxes, scales font size to box dimensions, applies configurable fonts, colors, optional background clearing, and can incorporate additional text augmentations, all driven by metadata and applied with a configurable probability.", "business_intent": "To enrich image datasets for tasks such as OCR, scene text detection, and document analysis by generating realistic synthetic text overlays, thereby improving model training and robustness.", "keywords": ["text overlay", "image augmentation", "synthetic text generation", "OCR", "scene text detection", "font rendering", "bounding box handling", "probabilistic transform", "Albumentations", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "0594c74243bb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:29:20+00:00"}
