{"summary": "The ImmobileStorageTransfer class encapsulates the configuration and state of an immobile fraction within a groundwater transport model, allowing multiple immobile domains to be defined. It stores arrays for initial concentration, porosity, mass‑transfer coefficients, decay rates, bulk density, and distribution coefficients, and manages optional features such as sorption, first‑ or zero‑order decay, and budget output. The class also handles file specifications for writing immobile concentration data and budget information, and provides validation of input parameters.", "business_intent": "Enable groundwater modelers to represent and simulate immobile storage and exchange processes—such as triple porosity, mass transfer between mobile and immobile zones, decay, and sorption—within a GWT framework, while offering configurable output and validation to support accurate analysis and reporting.", "keywords": ["groundwater", "transport", "immobile", "storage", "mass transfer", "decay", "sorption", "porosity", "simulation", "output", "validation", "budget"], "summary_hash": "7ffaafc4af57", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:48:43+00:00"}
