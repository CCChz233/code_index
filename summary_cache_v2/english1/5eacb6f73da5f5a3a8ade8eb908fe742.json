{"summary": "A comprehensive test suite for Qiskit's QuantumCircuit class that verifies a wide range of circuit operations, including instruction addition, barriers, parameter binding, copying, composition, control‑flow constructs, inversion, exponentiation, repetition, reversal, tensor products, measurement handling, removal of final measurements, and proper error handling for invalid inputs. It also includes tests that directly exercise internal methods such as gate decomposition, instruction stack manipulation, and scope validation.", "business_intent": "Ensure the correctness, stability, and regression safety of quantum circuit manipulation features in Qiskit, providing confidence to developers and users that circuit operations behave as expected across diverse scenarios.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "Qiskit", "unit testing", "instruction addition", "barrier", "parameter binding", "circuit copy", "circuit composition", "control flow", "if‑else", "circuit inversion", "exponentiation", "repetition", "reversal", "tensor product", "measurement handling", "final measurement removal", "error handling", "private methods", "gate decomposition", "instruction stack", "scope validation"], "summary_hash": "6ab339c3ab64", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:43:13+00:00"}
