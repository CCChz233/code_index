{"summary": "Implements the Mega block attention mechanism using a moving‑average gated formulation. The module computes attention scores, applies additive or multiplicative masks, and updates an internal hidden state to support efficient long‑range sequence processing in PyTorch models.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑performance, reusable attention component for deep learning applications that require scalable handling of long sequences, such as natural language processing, speech, or time‑series models.", "keywords": ["attention", "moving average", "gated", "PyTorch", "sequence modeling", "transformer", "long‑range", "neural network", "mask handling", "hidden state"], "summary_hash": "17251a1a3889", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:17:07+00:00"}
