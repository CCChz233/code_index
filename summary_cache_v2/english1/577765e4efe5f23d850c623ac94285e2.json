{"summary": "Implements the Glorot (Xavier) uniform weight initializer, generating tensor values from a uniform distribution bounded by ±sqrt(6/(fan_in+fan_out)). The class optionally accepts a seed or seed generator to make the sampling deterministic across calls.", "business_intent": "Provides a reliable, mathematically‑grounded initialization strategy for neural‑network layers, helping models converge faster and more stably when used in frameworks such as Keras.", "keywords": ["Glorot uniform", "Xavier initializer", "weight initialization", "uniform distribution", "deterministic seed", "deep learning", "Keras", "neural network", "fan_in", "fan_out"], "summary_hash": "d4b1d752898e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:52:00+00:00"}
