{"summary": "This module implements ShaDow-GNN subgraph samplers, providing k‑hop neighborhood extraction with support for shadow nodes, lazy loading of node and edge features, and edge exclusion utilities. It builds on the generic sampler framework to generate subgraphs suitable for efficient GNN training.", "business_intent": "Facilitate scalable and memory‑efficient training of graph neural networks by supplying a specialized sampler that creates compact subgraphs with shadow nodes and on‑demand feature loading.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "subgraph sampling", "k‑hop", "shadow nodes", "lazy feature loading", "DGL", "data loader", "edge exclusion", "transform"], "summary_hash": "10fa002a5d19", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:36:14+00:00"}
