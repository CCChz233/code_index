{"summary": "BlockwiseDep is a lightweight descriptor that represents an indexable I/O dependency within a Dask Blockwise layer. It stores the shape of the block grid (numblocks) and a flag indicating whether the dependency yields nested tasks (produces_tasks). Instances can be used in place of concrete collection names when defining Blockwise operations, allowing new collections to be materialized on‑the‑fly during execution.", "business_intent": "Enable dynamic creation and tracking of I/O‑based collections inside blockwise computations, facilitating lazy, partition‑aware data flow without requiring pre‑existing Dask collections.", "keywords": ["blockwise", "IO dependency", "indexable", "partition", "numblocks", "produces_tasks", "lazy evaluation", "Dask", "dynamic collection", "task generation"], "summary_hash": "e1ec78bcce7e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:07:50+00:00"}
