{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class Disk: interface to store files. Methods: __init__, exists, make_filename, read, write.

The constraint: \"Do NOT list method names verbatim.\" So we shouldn't include method names like \"write\", \"read\" in keywords?
