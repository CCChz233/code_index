So we shouldn't mention \"cancel\", \"submit\" etc? The summary can mention actions but not method names exactly? It says \"Do NOT list method names verbatim.\" So we should avoid using method names exactly as they appear. Use synonyms: \"cancel a job\", \"submit a job\". That's okay maybe not verbatim? The method names are cancel, submit, etc. Using \"cancel a job\" includes the word cancel but not as method name? Might be okay. Safer to avoid using the exact method names? Could phrase \"terminate a job\" instead of cancel. Use \"initiate\" instead of submit. Use \"check if job is completed\" instead of done. Use \"retrieve result\". Use \"monitor status\". Use \"wait until final state\".
