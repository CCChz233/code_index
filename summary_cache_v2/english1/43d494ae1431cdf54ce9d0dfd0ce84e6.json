{"summary": "This module implements data loading and preprocessing utilities for training Stable Diffusion models. It defines a synthetic dataset container, image‑size handling and square‑crop helpers, resolution‑based filtering, and a suite of functions that assemble training and validation datasets (including variants with precached CLIP embeddings and SDXL support) from WebDataset shards. The pipelines apply configurable augmentations and TorchVision transforms to prepare image‑text pairs for diffusion model training.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, flexible data pipeline that supplies correctly sized and augmented image‑text samples to Stable Diffusion training jobs, enabling efficient handling of large web‑scale datasets and synthetic data sources.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "dataset", "webdataset", "image preprocessing", "augmentation", "resolution filter", "synthetic dataset", "training validation split", "CLIP", "SDXL", "torch", "torchvision"], "summary_hash": "731c63fee82b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:05:31+00:00"}
