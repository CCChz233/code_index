{"summary": "This module implements image‑based registration utilities. It defines an enumeration of supported registration algorithms and a helper to invoke the chosen method. The core routine computes the translational shift between two image volumes, handling region‑of‑interest extraction, metadata loading, and writing the resulting shift table, while supporting Dask, Zarr and NGFF formats.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, automated way to align microscopy image datasets by calculating physical translation offsets, facilitating downstream analysis and integration in imaging pipelines.", "keywords": ["image registration", "translation shift", "microscopy", "region of interest", "phase cross correlation", "chi-squared", "enumeration", "metadata", "Zarr", "NGFF", "Dask"], "summary_hash": "356a5925aa93", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:56:34+00:00"}
