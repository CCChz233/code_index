{"summary": "This module defines core utilities for building and managing diffusion pipelines, including lightweight output containers for image and audio results, a base pipeline class that orchestrates models, schedulers, and processors, and a mixin that adds Stable Diffusion‑specific configuration helpers. It also bundles functions for loading, saving, device placement, and performance optimizations such as attention slicing and memory‑efficient attention.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to easily load, configure, and run diffusion models for image and audio generation, while providing tools to optimize resource usage and integrate with the Hugging Face Hub.", "keywords": ["diffusion pipeline", "model loading", "device placement", "attention slicing", "memory optimization", "image generation", "audio generation", "stable diffusion", "VAE", "UNet", "Hugging Face Hub", "torch", "numpy", "PIL"], "summary_hash": "be0441168cca", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:11:58+00:00"}
