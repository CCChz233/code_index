{"summary": "This module implements dataset wrappers for PyTorch that allow combining multiple audio corpora, generating synthetic code-switched samples with language-aware segment selection, duration limits, normalization, pauses, scaling, and augmentation, and providing flexible concatenation with configurable sampling policies such as temperature-adjusted probabilities, random weighting, or deterministic round-robin.", "business_intent": "To simplify the creation of multilingual and code-switching speech training pipelines, giving developers a ready-made way to merge and sample diverse audio datasets, thereby accelerating model development for robust automatic speech recognition across languages.", "keywords": ["dataset", "audio", "code-switching", "multilingual", "speech recognition", "PyTorch", "data augmentation", "normalization", "sampling strategy", "temperature weighting", "round-robin", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "e4f3d1ea34a6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:01:10+00:00"}
