{"summary": "The module defines a hierarchy of camera models used in neural radiance field (NeRF) pipelines. It provides an abstract base class for common camera operations such as intrinsic computation and projection matrix generation, and concrete implementations for pinhole, orthographic, and cube (six‑face) cameras, handling calibration parameters and supporting both NumPy and PyTorch tensors.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate camera calibration and projection handling for 3D scene reconstruction and rendering in multimodal AI systems, facilitating training and inference of NeRF models and related computer‑vision applications.", "keywords": ["camera model", "intrinsic parameters", "projection matrix", "pinhole camera", "orthographic camera", "cube map camera", "NeRF", "3D rendering", "multimodal AI", "calibration", "torch", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "1ca4cd834547", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:04:55+00:00"}
