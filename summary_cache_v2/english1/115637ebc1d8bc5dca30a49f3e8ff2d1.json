{"summary": "This module contains unit tests for the gradient norm utility in Lightning PyTorch. The tests verify that the utility correctly computes gradient norms, raises appropriate errors for unsupported norm types, and works with double-precision tensors.", "business_intent": "Validate the reliability of gradient norm calculations used during model training, ensure proper error handling for invalid inputs, and confirm compatibility with double-precision data types.", "keywords": ["gradient norm", "PyTorch", "Lightning", "unit testing", "error handling", "double precision", "tensor dtype"], "summary_hash": "12445b5469da", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:35:17+00:00"}
