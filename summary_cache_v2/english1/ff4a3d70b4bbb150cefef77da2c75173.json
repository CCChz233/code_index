{"summary": "This module defines a comprehensive test suite for the ControlNet inpainting pipelines in the Diffusers library. It includes lightweight fast tests that use mock components to verify core functionalities such as attention slicing, batch versus single inference consistency, and xformers attention integration, as well as slower integration tests that exercise real inpainting scenarios with Canny edge detection and generic masks. Additional test classes cover the simple and multi‑ControlNet variants, checking weight initialization, control guidance toggling, and handling of unimplemented features.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correctness, performance, and compatibility of ControlNet-based image inpainting pipelines, ensuring reliable behavior across different configurations and hardware setups before release.", "keywords": ["ControlNet", "inpainting", "pipeline testing", "fast unit tests", "slow integration tests", "attention slicing", "xformers", "batch inference", "multi-controlnet", "dummy components", "torch GPU", "diffusers"], "summary_hash": "9fb5e80f62ce", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:49:24+00:00"}
