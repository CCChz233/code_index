{"summary": "This module implements a diffusion‑based text‑to‑video pipeline. It combines a frozen T5 text encoder, a 3‑D variational auto‑encoder, a transformer denoiser, and a scheduler to iteratively refine latent video representations, finally decoding them into video frames. Helper utilities manage timestep selection and other preprocessing steps.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use solution for generating video clips from natural language prompts, supporting creative content creation, advertising, entertainment, and rapid prototyping of visual ideas.", "keywords": ["text‑to‑video", "diffusion model", "video generation", "transformer denoiser", "3‑D VAE", "T5 encoder", "scheduler", "AI pipeline", "generative AI", "media creation"], "summary_hash": "c219c0bd8f89", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:23:54+00:00"}
