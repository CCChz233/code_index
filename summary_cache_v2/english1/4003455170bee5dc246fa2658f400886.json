{"summary": "A Keras training callback that automatically saves model checkpoints to a local directory and synchronizes them with a Hugging Face Hub repository according to a configurable save strategy (e.g., each epoch or a fixed number of steps). It can also upload the associated tokenizer and manage authentication, optionally storing full training state for later resumption.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless, automated publishing of trained models to the Hugging Face Hub during training, supporting versioned model distribution and easy downstream loading.", "keywords": ["model checkpoint", "hub synchronization", "training callback", "save strategy", "tokenizer upload", "repository authentication", "resume training"], "summary_hash": "75e412536734", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:22:08+00:00"}
