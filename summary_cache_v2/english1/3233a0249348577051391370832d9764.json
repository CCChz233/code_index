{"summary": "Implements a configurable sliding‑window extractor that sweeps an entire image in row‑major order to produce a stack of patches. It supports custom patch size, start offset, fractional overlap, optional padding to include boundary patches, limiting the number of patches, sorting by patch intensity, and filtering by an intensity threshold. The result is a tensor of patches enriched with metadata such as each patch’s origin, total patch count, spatial shape, and offset.", "business_intent": "Facilitate patch‑based image processing workflows—such as training or inference of deep‑learning models, data augmentation, or localized analysis—by providing an efficient, flexible way to extract, filter, and rank image patches with full positional context.", "keywords": ["patch extraction", "sliding window", "overlap", "offset", "padding", "patch selection", "intensity threshold", "metadata", "image analysis", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "4a09b14b8777", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:07:49+00:00"}
