{"summary": "Implements a collection of internal validator functions that compare runtime values against Python typing constructs (e.g., literals, unions, callables, collections, IO types, NewType, etc.) and raise descriptive errors when mismatches occur. It also handles forward‑reference resolution, memoization of checks, and plugin loading for extensible type‑guard behavior.", "business_intent": "Provide a robust runtime type‑checking engine that enforces declared type hints, helping developers catch type errors during execution and supporting advanced typing features such as forward references and custom plugins.", "keywords": ["runtime type checking", "typing validation", "type hints", "Literal", "Union", "Callable", "IO", "NewType", "forward reference", "memoization", "plugin", "TypeCheckError"], "summary_hash": "9414e7e49e70", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:16:38+00:00"}
