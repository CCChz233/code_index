{"summary": "Implements a dataset that pre‑computes and caches the outcomes of deterministic (non‑random) preprocessing transforms, delivering cached data during training while still applying random transforms in real time. Allows configurable cache size or rate, data updates, and integrates with PyTorch DataLoader and MONAI lazy resampling.", "business_intent": "Accelerate deep‑learning training pipelines by avoiding repeated execution of static preprocessing steps, thereby reducing computational overhead and improving throughput.", "keywords": ["dataset", "caching", "deterministic transforms", "non-random preprocessing", "training acceleration", "PyTorch", "MONAI", "cache_rate", "cache_num", "lazy resampling", "data loader", "subset"], "summary_hash": "ec84e854da42", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:19:56+00:00"}
