{"summary": "The module offers mock implementations of core rocket hardware interfaces and supporting utilities, including a simulated camera feed, an inertial measurement unit that replays recorded sensor logs, a logger that auto‑cleans its output, and a terminal‑based visualizer that continuously renders flight telemetry. These components enable developers to test and debug flight software in a fully simulated environment without needing physical devices.", "business_intent": "Provide a complete, self‑contained simulation layer for rocket flight software, allowing safe, repeatable testing, development, and debugging of sensor processing, logging, and real‑time display functionalities without reliance on actual hardware.", "keywords": ["mock hardware", "simulation", "camera", "IMU", "logger", "terminal visualizer", "flight telemetry", "testing", "data stream", "temporary logs"], "summary_hash": "69a87ec44154", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:30:07+00:00"}
