{"summary": "The module defines a hierarchy of regular‑expression components and helper utilities that construct finite‑state automata for the Python lexical analyser. It includes constructs for alternation, sequencing, repetition, character code ranges, special line/file markers, and optional case‑insensitive matching, allowing complex token patterns to be built and rendered as textual regexes.", "business_intent": "Supply the core pattern‑building infrastructure needed by a Python lexer to recognize language tokens through compiled regular‑expression state machines.", "keywords": ["regular expression", "lexical analysis", "tokenizer", "finite state machine", "pattern composition", "alternation", "sequence", "repetition", "character range", "special symbols", "case insensitive", "Python lexer"], "summary_hash": "a94bb60ea297", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:29:00+00:00"}
