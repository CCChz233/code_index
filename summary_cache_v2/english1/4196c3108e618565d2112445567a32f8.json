{"summary": "A dataset class that reads a line‑by‑line JSON manifest describing video files and their corresponding transcripts, filters entries based on duration limits, optionally trims silence, selects audio channels, and converts the text into byte‑pair‑encoded token sequences (with optional BOS/EOS tokens). It returns tensors ready for training or inference in video‑based automatic speech recognition models.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient preparation of video‑speech training data for ASR systems, providing configurable preprocessing, tokenization, and filtering to streamline model development and deployment.", "keywords": ["video dataset", "manifest JSON", "byte pair encoding", "tokenizer", "duration filtering", "silence trimming", "channel selection", "ASR preprocessing", "start/end tokens", "sample ID"], "summary_hash": "333c86d3174e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:49:05+00:00"}
