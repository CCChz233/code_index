{"summary": "The script orchestrates the end‑to‑end workflow for training, evaluating and optionally predicting with a CompGCN‑based knowledge‑graph embedding model. It parses command‑line arguments, loads graph data, constructs the CompGCN‑ConvE model, runs the training loop, computes evaluation metrics and can generate predictions.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example that demonstrates how to apply the CompGCN model to knowledge‑graph completion tasks, enabling researchers and developers to benchmark, fine‑tune, or extend the model in their own projects.", "keywords": ["CompGCN", "ConvE", "knowledge graph embedding", "graph neural network", "PyTorch", "DGL", "training loop", "evaluation", "prediction", "command line interface"], "summary_hash": "fa9e179ac3aa", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:22:35+00:00"}
