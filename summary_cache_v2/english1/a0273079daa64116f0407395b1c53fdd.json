{"summary": "This module implements a generic decoder neural module for natural‑language processing models. It encapsulates common configuration options such as embedding size, hidden dimension, vocabulary size, maximum output length, and defines the expected input and output neural types (e.g., encoded representations and masks). The class can be subclassed to create task‑specific decoders for sequence‑to‑sequence, language modeling, or other generation tasks within the NeMo framework.", "business_intent": "Offer a reusable, configurable decoder component that can be integrated into various NLP pipelines to generate token sequences, enabling rapid development of translation, summarization, speech‑to‑text, and other generative models.", "keywords": ["decoder", "NLP", "NeMo", "neural module", "embedding", "hidden dimension", "vocabulary size", "max sequence length", "neural types", "encoded representation", "mask", "sequence generation", "configurable"], "summary_hash": "f8e1a3d8a944", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:21:10+00:00"}
