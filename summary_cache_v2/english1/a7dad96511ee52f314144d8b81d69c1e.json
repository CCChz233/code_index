{"summary": "Utility module for working with NetCDF files via the netCDF4 library. It offers a wrapper that presents a collection of files sharing the same dimensions as a single dataset, and provides functions to retrieve latitude/longitude data, determine coordinate orientation, recognize CF‑standard names for geographic, temporal, and vertical axes, and convert numeric time values to datetime objects.", "business_intent": "Streamline the ingestion and manipulation of geophysical and atmospheric data stored in NetCDF format, making it easier for scientific applications to access spatial and temporal coordinates and to handle multi‑file datasets as a unified source.", "keywords": ["netCDF", "netCDF4", "CF conventions", "latitude", "longitude", "time conversion", "vertical axis", "multi‑file dataset", "data extraction", "coordinate orientation", "scientific data processing"], "summary_hash": "d49a3172fe1c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:48:57+00:00"}
