{"summary": "This module implements a set of launchers that manage external processes required by Lightning training strategies. It provides an abstract lifecycle manager and concrete implementations for multiprocessing on CPUs/GPUs, spawning multiple script instances on a single node, and orchestrating XLA‑compatible workers for TPUs, handling state propagation, environment configuration, and graceful termination.", "business_intent": "To simplify and standardize the execution of distributed PyTorch Lightning training across diverse hardware setups (multi‑GPU, multi‑node, TPU) by abstracting process creation, synchronization, and cleanup, thereby improving scalability and reliability for users and enterprise ML pipelines.", "keywords": ["launcher", "process management", "distributed training", "PyTorch Lightning", "multiprocessing", "subprocess", "XLA", "TPU", "GPU", "environment variables", "state synchronization", "signal handling"], "summary_hash": "a3638013a8bc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:14:05+00:00"}
