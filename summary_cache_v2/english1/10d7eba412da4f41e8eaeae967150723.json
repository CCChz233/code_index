{"summary": "This module defines a comprehensive suite of unit tests that exercise Django's database backend layer. It validates core backend behavior such as cursor management, query execution, parameter formatting, Unicode handling, transaction control, constraint enforcement, sequence generation, and thread‑local connection handling across multiple database engines (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, and the dummy backend). The tests also cover utility functions, signal emission, and edge‑case scenarios like long identifiers and zero primary keys.", "business_intent": "To ensure the reliability, compatibility, and correctness of Django's database backend implementations by automatically detecting regressions and verifying that each supported database engine conforms to expected behavior under a wide range of conditions.", "keywords": ["Django", "database backend", "unit testing", "PostgreSQL", "MySQL", "Oracle", "SQLite", "dummy backend", "cursor management", "query execution", "transaction handling", "constraint enforcement", "sequence reset", "thread safety", "parameter formatting", "Unicode handling", "referential integrity", "signal testing"], "summary_hash": "248d7b928c2e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:49:19+00:00"}
