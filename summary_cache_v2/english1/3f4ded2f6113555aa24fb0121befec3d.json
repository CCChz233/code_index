{"summary": "The module aggregates a suite of differentiable loss utilities for training deep learning models, primarily targeting medical image segmentation and related tasks. It offers a range of similarity‑based and classification losses—including overlap‑based measures, focal variants, and regularization terms—implemented with PyTorch and supporting multi‑class, binary, and combined configurations.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and developers of medical imaging AI with ready‑to‑use, numerically stable loss functions that address class imbalance, multi‑class segmentation, and training stability, thereby accelerating model development and improving performance on clinical image analysis.", "keywords": ["medical imaging", "deep learning", "segmentation loss", "overlap metric", "class imbalance handling", "PyTorch", "composite loss", "training stability", "similarity measure"], "summary_hash": "afb697a76d47", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:29:29+00:00"}
