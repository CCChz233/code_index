{"summary": "A configuration container for MobileBERT models that holds all architectural hyperparameters such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, dropout rates, bottleneck settings, and normalization options. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate a MobileBERT model with the desired structure and behavior.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to easily customize and instantiate MobileBERT models by specifying model architecture details and training settings, supporting both standard and specialized MobileBERT variants for downstream NLP tasks.", "keywords": ["MobileBERT", "configuration", "hyperparameters", "transformer", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "dropout", "bottleneck", "normalization", "pretrained config"], "summary_hash": "54c5c99f834f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:38:08+00:00"}
