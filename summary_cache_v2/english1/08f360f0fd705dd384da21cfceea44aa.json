{"summary": "Utility module that builds and manages k‑nearest neighbor graphs using FAISS (both CPU and GPU). It provides classes to construct FAISS indexes, insert vectors, perform fast similarity queries, filter neighbor lists by distance thresholds, and retrieve stored neighbor information. Helper functions convert neighbor data into sparse matrix formats and ordered neighbor lists.", "business_intent": "To provide fast, scalable nearest‑neighbor search and graph construction for clustering, recommendation, or other machine‑learning workflows that require similarity queries over large high‑dimensional datasets.", "keywords": ["k-nearest neighbor", "FAISS", "GPU acceleration", "sparse matrix", "similarity search", "clustering", "high-dimensional vectors", "neighbor graph", "threshold filtering", "multiprocessing"], "summary_hash": "dd063d5bdd49", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:26:40+00:00"}
