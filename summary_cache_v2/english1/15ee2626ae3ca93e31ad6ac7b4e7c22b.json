{"summary": "A command‑line example that trains an unconditional DDPM diffusion model on an image dataset using PyTorch, the Diffusers library, and Accelerate for distributed execution. It handles data loading, image preprocessing, model and scheduler setup, optimizer and learning‑rate scheduling, EMA, periodic evaluation with a pipeline, checkpoint saving, and optional logging to TensorBoard/W&B and repository upload.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run reference implementation for developers and researchers to train or fine‑tune unconditional image generation diffusion models, accelerating product prototyping and research in generative AI.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "unconditional image generation", "training script", "accelerate", "pytorch", "unet", "ddpm", "scheduler", "ema", "huggingface", "dataset", "checkpoint", "logging", "tensorboard", "wandb"], "summary_hash": "8d83165513c5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:58:24+00:00"}
