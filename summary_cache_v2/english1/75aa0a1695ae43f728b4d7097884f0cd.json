{"summary": "This module implements a multiprocessing launcher for Lightning Fabric that spawns several worker processes, assigns each a unique rank, prepares the execution environment (device placement, RNG states, thread settings), runs a target callable in parallel, and guarantees proper joining and cleanup of all processes. It also provides safety checks for CUDA forking, main‑guard presence, and utilities to disable shared memory and unshare namespaces.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient, reliable parallel execution of training or inference workloads across multiple processes, abstracting away low‑level process management and environment setup to support scalable distributed training within the Lightning ecosystem.", "keywords": ["multiprocessing", "process launcher", "parallel execution", "PyTorch", "process coordination", "rank assignment", "device management", "RNG state handling", "CUDA fork safety", "main guard verification", "memory sharing control", "namespace unshare"], "summary_hash": "2dc69373a0b5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:05:07+00:00"}
