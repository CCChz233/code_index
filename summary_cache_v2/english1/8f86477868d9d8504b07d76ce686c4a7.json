{"summary": "The module implements a Flax‑based safety checker for Stable Diffusion image generation. It defines a model class that loads a CLIP vision encoder, computes similarity between generated images and a set of unsafe concepts, and provides a callable interface to flag potentially inappropriate content. A helper routine computes cosine distances using JAX.", "business_intent": "To automatically detect and filter out policy‑violating or unsafe images produced by Stable Diffusion, helping developers maintain compliance and protect end‑users from harmful visual content.", "keywords": ["Flax", "JAX", "Stable Diffusion", "image safety", "content moderation", "CLIP vision model", "cosine similarity", "neural network", "AI ethics", "policy compliance"], "summary_hash": "5603737a64ed", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:24:34+00:00"}
