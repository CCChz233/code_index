{"summary": "A collection of command‑line training scripts that demonstrate how to fine‑tune the decoder and prior components of the Kandinsky 2.2 text‑to‑image diffusion model, including LoRA‑based parameter‑efficient adaptation. The pipelines cover dataset loading, preprocessing, model initialization, optimizer and scheduler configuration, distributed training with Accelerate, periodic validation image generation, checkpoint management, and optional publishing to the Hugging Face Hub.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to customize Kandinsky 2.2 for their own image‑caption datasets, improving text‑to‑image generation quality while providing easy integration with cloud storage, experiment tracking, and scalable multi‑GPU training.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "diffusion model", "Kandinsky 2.2", "decoder", "prior", "LoRA", "fine-tuning", "Accelerate", "distributed training", "Hugging Face Hub", "checkpointing", "validation", "multi‑GPU"], "summary_hash": "01904b3401bd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:39:38+00:00"}
