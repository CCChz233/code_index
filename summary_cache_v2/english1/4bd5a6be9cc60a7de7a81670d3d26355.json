{"summary": "Provides a Cluster‑GCN sampler that partitions a homogeneous CPU graph using METIS, caches node lists for each partition, and builds induced subgraphs for selected partition IDs. It supports optional prefetching of node and edge attributes, lazy feature handling, and placement of the sampled subgraph on a target device.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable mini‑batch training of graph neural networks on large graphs by efficiently sampling clusters of nodes, reducing memory usage and computation while integrating with DGL's data loading pipeline.", "keywords": ["Cluster-GCN", "graph sampler", "METIS partitioning", "subgraph extraction", "lazy feature loading", "prefetching", "device placement", "DGL", "graph neural network", "mini-batch training"], "summary_hash": "0d50510bee87", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:36:03+00:00"}
