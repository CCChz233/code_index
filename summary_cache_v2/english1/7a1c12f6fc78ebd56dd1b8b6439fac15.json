{"summary": "The module defines dataset utilities for automatic speech recognition that read pre‑computed audio feature manifests and associated transcriptions, apply optional preprocessing (normalization, augmentation, channel selection, silence trimming, RTTM‑based masking/dropping), and convert the text into token sequences using either byte‑pair‑encoding or character tokenizers. It also provides a processor for extracting text information from feature manifests.", "business_intent": "To supply ready‑to‑use, configurable ASR training data pipelines that map audio features to tokenized text, facilitating model development and experimentation with various preprocessing and tokenization strategies.", "keywords": ["ASR", "dataset", "feature manifest", "tokenization", "BPE", "character", "preprocessing", "normalization", "augmentation", "channel selection", "silence trimming", "RTTM masking", "duration filtering", "NeMo", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "2a141a6e63c0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:09:24+00:00"}
