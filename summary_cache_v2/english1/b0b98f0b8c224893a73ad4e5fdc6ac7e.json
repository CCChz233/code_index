{"summary": "This module contains a collection of lightweight model and callback definitions along with a comprehensive set of unit tests that validate the Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) spawn strategy in PyTorch Lightning. The tests cover launcher configuration, process creation, barrier synchronization, optimizer device placement, zero‑redundancy optimizer support, early stopping, handling of unused parameters, and multi‑GPU execution scenarios.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that Lightning's DDP spawn implementation functions correctly across various hardware configurations and edge cases, thereby providing reliable distributed training capabilities for end‑users.", "keywords": ["DDP", "spawn", "distributed training", "PyTorch Lightning", "multi‑GPU", "zero redundancy optimizer", "early stopping", "process launcher", "barrier synchronization", "optimizer device placement", "unused parameters"], "summary_hash": "903fcc3657a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:33:49+00:00"}
