{"summary": "The module implements a Maui‑style lexical matching system for the Annif framework. It generates candidate subject terms from input text, converts these candidates into feature vectors using token‑set statistics and IDF weighting, and trains a bagging ensemble of decision‑tree classifiers to rank and predict the most relevant subjects.", "business_intent": "To enhance automatic subject indexing and document classification by combining lexical term extraction with machine‑learning ranking, enabling more accurate and scalable annotation of textual resources.", "keywords": ["lexical matching", "candidate generation", "feature conversion", "IDF weighting", "bagging classifier", "decision tree", "token set", "subject indexing", "Annif", "Maui-inspired"], "summary_hash": "44201d46a01d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:34:29+00:00"}
