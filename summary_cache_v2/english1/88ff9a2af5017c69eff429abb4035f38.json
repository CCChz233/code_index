{"summary": "A training script that fine‑tunes the CogVideoX diffusion model using parameter‑efficient LoRA adapters. It defines a video dataset loader with preprocessing, prepares text and video embeddings, configures the optimizer and scheduler, runs a distributed training loop with Accelerate, and handles checkpoint saving and optional model‑card publishing to the Hugging Face hub.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to adapt the large‑scale CogVideoX video generation model to custom video datasets with minimal compute overhead, facilitating the creation of specialized text‑to‑video generation capabilities.", "keywords": ["CogVideoX", "LoRA", "video generation", "fine‑tuning", "diffusion model", "parameter‑efficient adaptation", "distributed training", "Accelerate", "Hugging Face", "dataset preprocessing", "model checkpoint", "model card"], "summary_hash": "bb7065c696de", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:58:44+00:00"}
