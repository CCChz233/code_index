{"summary": "Test module that validates the StableUnCLIP image‑to‑image diffusion pipeline. It provides a fast test suite using lightweight dummy components to check core features such as attention slicing, handling missing image embeddings, batch inference consistency, and xformers‑based attention, as well as an integration suite that runs the pipeline with real model weights across various scales and CPU offloading configurations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness, stability, and performance of the StableUnCLIP Img2Img generation pipeline before deployment, ensuring it works reliably under different hardware setups and model sizes while supporting advanced features like efficient attention mechanisms.", "keywords": ["StableUnCLIP", "image-to-image", "diffusion pipeline", "unit testing", "integration testing", "attention slicing", "xformers", "CPU offloading", "batch inference", "dummy components", "torch", "transformers"], "summary_hash": "6771d8236f7c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:50:27+00:00"}
