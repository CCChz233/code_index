{"summary": "The module implements a custom diffusion pipeline that extends the standard Stable Diffusion workflow with a high‑resolution fixing technique. It coordinates the VAE, CLIP text encoder, tokenizer, UNet denoiser, scheduler, and safety checker, while providing built‑in mechanisms for loading LoRA weights, textual inversion embeddings, IP adapters, and checkpoint files. It also defines a modified UNet that scales intermediate activation maps at selected timesteps and blocks to improve high‑resolution image synthesis.", "business_intent": "To empower developers and artists to generate higher‑quality, high‑resolution images using Stable Diffusion, offering an out‑of‑the‑box solution that incorporates advanced fine‑tuning methods and safety features.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "high resolution", "kohya fix", "custom pipeline", "UNet", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "IP adapter", "checkpoint loading", "image generation", "diffusion model", "safety checker", "VAE", "CLIP"], "summary_hash": "28550ee0cb16", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:03:18+00:00"}
