{"summary": "Implements a 1‑dimensional adaptive average pooling layer that reduces a temporal dimension to a specified output length, automatically computing the kernel size and stride. Supports both channels‑last and channels‑first tensor formats.", "business_intent": "Enable models to accept inputs of varying sequence lengths while producing a consistent pooled representation, simplifying architecture design for tasks such as time‑series analysis, audio processing, or NLP.", "keywords": ["adaptive average pooling", "1D", "fixed output size", "variable input length", "channels_last", "channels_first", "TensorFlow", "neural network layer"], "summary_hash": "7a00af80c418", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:31:33+00:00"}
