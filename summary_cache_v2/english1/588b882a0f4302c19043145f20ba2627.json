{"summary": "Implements a Lightning strategy that orchestrates model‑parallel training across multiple devices. It sets up a distributed device mesh, manages process group initialization, handles sharded checkpoint saving/loading, synchronizes collective operations, and ensures optimizers and seeds are correctly configured for model‑parallel execution.", "business_intent": "Provide users a high‑level, plug‑and‑play solution for scaling large neural networks with model parallelism, abstracting the low‑level distributed setup and checkpoint handling so they can focus on model development.", "keywords": ["model parallel", "distributed training", "device mesh", "sharded checkpoint", "Lightning strategy", "PyTorch", "process group", "collective communication", "optimizer device placement", "seed synchronization"], "summary_hash": "ff216acade89", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:52:50+00:00"}
