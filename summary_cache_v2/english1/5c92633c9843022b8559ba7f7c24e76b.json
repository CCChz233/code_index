{"summary": "The GRZ class models a global RZ rotation gate that applies the same Z‑axis phase shift to every qubit in a register simultaneously. It is a native operation for ion‑trap and neutral‑atom hardware and mathematically corresponds to exp(-i φ Σ_i Z_i). For a single qubit it reduces to the standard RZ gate, while for multiple qubits it acts as the direct sum of individual RZ rotations.", "business_intent": "Provide a hardware‑native multi‑qubit phase‑rotation gate abstraction within Qiskit, enabling users to construct and simulate circuits that exploit the global RZ capability of ion‑trap and neutral‑atom quantum processors, thereby improving circuit efficiency and fidelity.", "keywords": ["global RZ", "quantum gate", "multi‑qubit rotation", "ion‑trap", "neutral‑atom", "phase gate", "Qiskit", "circuit library", "native gate", "Z rotation"], "summary_hash": "3889dd8ffa50", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:14:30+00:00"}
