{"summary": "Provides a flexible base class for defining ordered binary structures where each field is described by a name and a format specifier or a nested structure. It manages field ordering, alignment, size calculations, and conversion between Python values and their byte representation using the struct module and additional custom specifiers.", "business_intent": "Enables developers to serialize and deserialize protocol messages, file records, or any fixed‑layout binary data without manually handling byte offsets, making it easier to implement network services, file parsers, and low‑level data exchange formats.", "keywords": ["binary serialization", "struct packing", "ordered fields", "custom format specifiers", "nested structures", "size calculation", "alignment handling", "protocol parsing", "byte conversion", "data unpacking"], "summary_hash": "7663938cbf21", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:27:44+00:00"}
