{"summary": "This module defines automated tests for the DeepFloyd IF inpainting super‑resolution pipeline, covering both quick unit checks with dummy components and a comprehensive integration test. The tests validate forward passes, attention slicing, batch inference consistency, model serialization across formats, and compatibility with optimized attention mechanisms on GPU devices.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness, performance, and deployability of the inpainting super‑resolution pipeline, enabling reliable image editing services and supporting efficient hardware acceleration.", "keywords": ["inpainting", "super-resolution", "pipeline testing", "unit tests", "integration tests", "attention slicing", "batch inference", "model serialization", "GPU acceleration", "xformers", "deepfloyd", "diffusers"], "summary_hash": "78e8bb8b981e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:52:09+00:00"}
