{"summary": "Implements a uniformly controlled (multiplexed) single‑qubit gate that applies a specific 2×2 unitary to a target qubit based on the binary state of multiple control qubits. It constructs the block‑diagonal matrix, validates inputs, provides inversion, and performs the reference decomposition into elementary operations.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable component for building, validating, and decomposing multiplexed quantum gates, allowing quantum circuit designers to efficiently synthesize and simulate controlled operations with many control qubits.", "keywords": ["uniformly controlled gate", "multiplexed gate", "quantum circuit synthesis", "control qubits", "target qubit", "block diagonal unitary", "gate decomposition", "parameter validation", "inverse operation", "Bergholm decomposition"], "summary_hash": "9589d9f79b56", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:35:13+00:00"}
