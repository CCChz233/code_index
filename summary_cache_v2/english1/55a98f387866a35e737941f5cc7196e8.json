{"summary": "Provides a hybrid encoder‑decoder RNNT model augmented with an auxiliary CTC decoder and loss, using subword (BPE) tokenization. It manages data loading for training and transcription, allows runtime changes to decoding strategy and vocabulary, and can enumerate compatible model variants.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and enterprises to build flexible, high‑accuracy speech‑to‑text solutions that leverage both RNNT and CTC objectives, with easy reconfiguration of token vocabularies and decoding methods for diverse deployment scenarios.", "keywords": ["RNNT", "CTC", "encoder-decoder", "subword tokenization", "BPE", "speech recognition", "model configuration", "data loading", "decoding strategy", "vocabulary management"], "summary_hash": "a5ffbdb5dce0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:19:41+00:00"}
