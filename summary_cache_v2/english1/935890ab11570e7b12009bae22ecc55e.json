{"summary": "The module defines a suite of unit tests that validate the functionality of a statistics handling component used during model training. It checks that loss and metric values are correctly recorded, internal counters are updated, logging output is generated as expected, and edge cases such as missing attributes or raised exceptions are handled gracefully.", "business_intent": "Ensure reliable monitoring and reporting of training metrics in a deep‑learning workflow, providing confidence that the statistics handler integrates correctly with the training engine and logs information needed for model evaluation and debugging.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "statistics handler", "training metrics", "loss tracking", "logging", "event filtering", "ignite engine", "MONAI", "exception handling", "parameterized tests"], "summary_hash": "171d7b4c86b3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:26:03+00:00"}
