{"summary": "Encapsulates the definition and processing of horizontal flow barriers for a MODFLOW‑6 groundwater model. It takes a GeoDataFrame of barrier geometries with associated multiplier values, determines the appropriate barrier type and variable names, computes barrier parameters, and generates the HFB6 package input, applying the multiplier to whole layers when barriers intersect them.", "business_intent": "Enable modelers to easily incorporate spatially varying flow resistance into MODFLOW‑6 simulations by specifying barrier shapes and multipliers, automating the creation of correct package input for accurate groundwater flow modeling.", "keywords": ["horizontal flow barrier", "MODFLOW 6", "groundwater modeling", "multiplier", "GIS", "GeoDataFrame", "barrier geometry", "simulation input", "hydraulic resistance", "vertical layer handling"], "summary_hash": "d8e5386dd63e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:33:59+00:00"}
