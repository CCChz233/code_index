{"summary": "A command‑line utility that prepares a text‑image dataset, configures a Stable Diffusion pipeline with LoRA attention adapters, and runs a distributed fine‑tuning loop using Accelerate. It handles tokenization, preprocessing, training hyper‑parameters, checkpointing, optional logging, and model‑card generation for publishing the adapted model.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and developers with an out‑of‑the‑box script to efficiently adapt Stable Diffusion to new visual concepts via low‑rank adaptation (LoRA), reducing compute cost and enabling rapid deployment of customized text‑to‑image generators.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion", "LoRA", "text-to-image", "fine-tuning", "diffusion model", "accelerate", "distributed training", "dataset preprocessing", "tokenization", "CLIP", "UNet", "checkpointing", "model card", "Hugging Face", "wandb", "xformers"], "summary_hash": "d0a4e04931be", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:07:39+00:00"}
