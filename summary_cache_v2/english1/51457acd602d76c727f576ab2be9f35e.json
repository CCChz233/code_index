{"summary": "This module defines a suite of unit tests that exercise the secret‑scanning functionality over Git commit histories. The tests simulate various repository scenarios—adding, removing, renaming, and modifying files, handling multiline and JSON/YAML/Terraform content, merge commits, and timeout conditions—to verify that the GitHistorySecretStore and the secret‑detection runner correctly identify added and removed secrets across commits.", "business_intent": "Validate that the secret detection engine can reliably scan Git histories, correctly report secrets introduced or deleted in each commit, and handle complex file changes and edge cases, thereby ensuring security compliance for code repositories.", "keywords": ["secret detection", "git history", "unit tests", "commit analysis", "added secrets", "removed secrets", "file rename", "file modify", "multiline files", "merge commits", "timeout handling", "runner", "store"], "summary_hash": "1ae676f6b709", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:58:54+00:00"}
