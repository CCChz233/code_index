{"summary": "The module builds PyVista unstructured grids directly from xarray DataArrays, handling voxel, layered, and 2‑D surface data while preserving discontinuities and nodata cells. It also supplies utilities for creating and animating 3‑D time‑varying grid visualizations with configurable rendering settings.", "business_intent": "Facilitate high‑performance scientific visualization of spatial model outputs (e.g., groundwater or MODFLOW simulations), enabling users to explore, animate, and export detailed 3‑D representations of time‑dependent data for analysis and communication.", "keywords": ["pyvista", "unstructured grid", "voxel model", "layered model", "DEM", "3D animation", "time‑varying data", "scientific visualization", "groundwater modeling", "grid construction"], "summary_hash": "20149e255717", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:44:34+00:00"}
