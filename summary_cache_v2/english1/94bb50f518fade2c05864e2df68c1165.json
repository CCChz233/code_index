{"summary": "Implements a diffusion scheduler that governs the evolution of noise across discrete timesteps, providing utilities to set timesteps, inject noise, and iteratively update samples during the generative process. Includes a lightweight output container for each step and auxiliary routines for generating Gumbel noise and applying random top‑k masking.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable and configurable sampling in diffusion‑based generative AI models, allowing developers to control noise schedules and improve the quality and efficiency of image generation pipelines.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "noise schedule", "timesteps", "generative AI", "sampling", "denoising", "Gumbel noise", "top‑k masking", "image generation"], "summary_hash": "ae95bf2cb78d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:14:39+00:00"}
