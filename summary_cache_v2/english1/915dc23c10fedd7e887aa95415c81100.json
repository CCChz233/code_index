{"summary": "A test suite that validates the functionality of various logits processors used in language model generation, checking that they correctly adjust token probability distributions for constraints such as forced start/end tokens, minimum sequence length, temperature scaling, and top‑k/top‑p filtering, both in standard and JIT‑compiled execution paths.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of text generation pipelines by verifying that custom logits processing components enforce desired generation rules and performance optimizations, thereby improving model output quality and reliability.", "keywords": ["logits processing", "language model generation", "forced token constraints", "minimum length enforcement", "temperature scaling", "top‑k sampling", "top‑p (nucleus) sampling", "processor list composition", "JIT compilation", "unit testing"], "summary_hash": "69cd4e2eb3df", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:24:22+00:00"}
