{"summary": "Provides comprehensive unit tests for a commutation checking component used in quantum circuit analysis, verifying that the checker correctly identifies commuting and non‑commuting operations across a wide range of gate types, parameters, barriers, measurements, resets, conditional and annotated operations, as well as handling caching, wide‑gate interactions, UTF‑8 gate names, and disjoint qubit sets.", "business_intent": "Ensures the reliability and correctness of the commutation analysis logic that underpins quantum circuit optimization and transformation tools, by systematically testing its behavior with standard, complex, and edge‑case quantum operations.", "keywords": ["quantum", "commutation", "gate", "unit test", "caching", "parameterized", "barrier", "measurement", "reset", "wide gate", "UTF-8", "conditional", "annotated operations", "circuit optimization"], "summary_hash": "4a9cc4c4a17b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:13:36+00:00"}
