{"summary": "The module implements a Qiskit transpiler pass that traverses a quantum circuit, detects consecutive single‑qubit rotation gates (U1, U2, U3, Phase) and replaces each run with a single equivalent rotation gate. It supports both numeric and symbolic parameters, leverages a fast Rust composition routine when available, and falls back to quaternion‑based math for accurate merging.", "business_intent": "To streamline quantum circuits by fusing adjacent single‑qubit rotations, thereby lowering gate count and circuit depth, which improves execution fidelity, reduces runtime, and enhances overall transpilation efficiency.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit optimization", "single-qubit gate fusion", "transpiler pass", "gate composition", "parameterized rotations", "Qiskit", "U1", "U2", "U3", "Phase gate", "quaternion", "Rust acceleration"], "summary_hash": "78c954273580", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:24:46+00:00"}
