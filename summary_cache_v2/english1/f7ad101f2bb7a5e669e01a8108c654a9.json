{"summary": "The module offers a complete example of the Scalable Inception Graph Neural Network (SIGN) applied to Open Graph Benchmark node property prediction tasks. It includes utilities to load OGB datasets, transform them into homogeneous DGL graphs, and evaluate results, as well as an implementation of the SIGN architecture that aggregates multi‑scale neighbor features and a feed‑forward classifier, together with training and evaluation pipelines.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run reference implementation for researchers and engineers to experiment with a scalable GNN model on standard OGB benchmarks, enabling performance comparison, model development, and deployment of graph‑based machine learning solutions.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "SIGN", "OGB", "node classification", "PyTorch", "DGL", "multi‑scale aggregation", "homogeneous graph", "scalable GNN", "benchmark"], "summary_hash": "f6d84abb362c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:56:43+00:00"}
