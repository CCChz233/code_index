{"summary": "A test suite that runs slow integration checks on the Stable Diffusion ControlNet pipeline when the model is stored as a single-file checkpoint. It verifies correct component loading, respects both diffusers and original configuration files, handles local‑only file scenarios, confirms that inference results match the reference pretrained behavior, and validates datatype handling such as fp16.", "business_intent": "Ensure that deploying Stable Diffusion ControlNet models in a single-file format is reliable and production‑ready by confirming proper loading, configuration compliance, deterministic inference, and correct performance across data types.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "controlnet", "single-file checkpoint", "integration testing", "model loading", "configuration validation", "inference consistency", "fp16", "GPU", "deterministic testing"], "summary_hash": "3065c76d0a52", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:45:35+00:00"}
