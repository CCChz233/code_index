{"summary": "HardNet is a neural module that generates 128‑dimensional HardNet descriptors from 32×32 single‑channel image patches. It optionally loads pretrained weights, normalizes the input patches, and runs the forward pass to produce a descriptor tensor for each patch.", "business_intent": "Enable applications that require robust local feature matching such as image retrieval, visual SLAM, structure‑from‑motion, and object recognition by providing high‑quality learned descriptors.", "keywords": ["HardNet", "descriptor", "local features", "grayscale patches", "pretrained", "deep learning", "PyTorch", "128‑dimensional", "feature extraction"], "summary_hash": "17b8039de69a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:41:14+00:00"}
