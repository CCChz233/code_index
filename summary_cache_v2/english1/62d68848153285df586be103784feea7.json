{"summary": "The module implements a PyQt5 based control panel that lets users create, edit, display and manage several flight trajectories on the top‑view map. It handles conversion between geographic and planar coordinates, renders the paths, provides access to their longitude/latitude data, and supports adding, removing and updating individual routes. Additional UI components manage operation lists and interaction with the Mscolab collaborative service.", "business_intent": "Enable users of the MSS platform to efficiently configure and visualise multiple flight paths within a single interface, facilitating planning, monitoring and collaborative sharing of routes.", "keywords": ["flightpath", "multiple routes", "control widget", "topview map", "PyQt5", "coordinate conversion", "rendering", "add remove update", "UI", "Mscolab", "collaboration"], "summary_hash": "4d24a7b8bfb3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:50:58+00:00"}
