{"summary": "This module implements the core neural type system for the NeMo framework, defining classes that describe a tensor's structural and semantic properties—including axis semantics, element data type, and optionality—and providing mechanisms to validate and compare these specifications. It also defines specialized exceptions for mismatched port names and incompatible tensor types, enabling robust error reporting during model composition.", "business_intent": "To enforce strict compatibility of tensor interfaces between neural modules, catching shape, axis, and data‑type mismatches early, thereby improving model reliability, safety, and ease of integration within deep‑learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["NeuralType", "tensor validation", "axis semantics", "element type", "type compatibility", "error handling", "NeMo framework", "deep learning", "type safety"], "summary_hash": "dd1d3083ebb2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:41:29+00:00"}
