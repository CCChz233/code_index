{"summary": "The module defines a client‑side algorithm that orchestrates the loading of a MONAI bundle, prepares the training and evaluation workflows, manages device allocation and checkpoint handling, and extracts either full model weights or weight differences for federated learning. It also provides utilities for loading bundle configurations and computing detailed data statistics, optionally including histograms, to support federated training scenarios.", "business_intent": "To facilitate federated learning in medical imaging applications by providing a ready‑to‑use client component that can locally train and evaluate MONAI segmentation models, manage model updates, and share concise weight information with a central server.", "keywords": ["federated learning", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "segmentation", "client algorithm", "bundle workflow", "local training", "model weight extraction", "weight difference", "checkpoint management", "device selection", "data statistics"], "summary_hash": "305ca6222e67", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:15:48+00:00"}
