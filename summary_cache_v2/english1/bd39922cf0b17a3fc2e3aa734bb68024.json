{"summary": "The module showcases an early-binding approach using Cython's cpdef to accelerate area calculations for rectangular shapes. It defines a class that stores width and height and provides a method to compute the surface area, along with a lightweight helper routine for the same purpose.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate a performance‑oriented coding pattern that leverages static binding to reduce overhead in geometric computations, serving as a reference for developers seeking speed improvements in numerical or graphics applications.", "keywords": ["Cython", "cpdef", "early binding", "performance optimization", "rectangle area", "geometry", "class abstraction", "helper function"], "summary_hash": "f0f012926100", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:16:04+00:00"}
