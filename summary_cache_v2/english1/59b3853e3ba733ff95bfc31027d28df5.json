{"summary": "Implements a high‑level pipeline that clusters speaker embeddings extracted from long audio recordings. The module validates inputs, splits embeddings into overlapping windows, applies offline/online clustering algorithms to assign speaker IDs per window, merges and aggregates the results across windows, and produces final speaker label sequences.", "business_intent": "Enable automatic speaker diarization for extended recordings, facilitating downstream speech analytics, transcription, and content indexing.", "keywords": ["speaker clustering", "long-form audio", "speaker diarization", "embedding windowing", "offline clustering", "online clustering", "PyTorch", "label aggregation"], "summary_hash": "d338425ba159", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:13:14+00:00"}
