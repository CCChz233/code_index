{"summary": "The module defines a set of lightweight helper functions that serve as overrides for local and remote execution contexts, handling custom exception and class serialization/deserialization as well as simple attribute get/set and print operations. These utilities are used to emulate and test Metaflow's environment escape behavior.", "business_intent": "Provide mock implementations for serialization, deserialization, and attribute manipulation that enable reliable testing of Metaflow's environment escape mechanism across local and remote environments.", "keywords": ["Metaflow", "environment escape", "overrides", "serialization", "deserialization", "local execution", "remote execution", "testing", "mock functions", "exception handling", "attribute access"], "summary_hash": "bd8c008f450c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:15:48+00:00"}
