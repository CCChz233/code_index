{"summary": "Represents a node that models an indexing operation within the compiler’s abstract syntax tree. It analyses the target and index expressions, determines their types (including buffers, C arrays, C functions, C tuples, C++ objects, Python objects, and fused types), infers result types, computes compile‑time constants, and generates the appropriate C/Cython code for getitem, setitem, assignment and deletion, while handling none‑checks and type dependencies.", "business_intent": "Enable the compiler to perform static type analysis and generate efficient low‑level code for indexed access across a wide range of data structures, improving performance and correctness of generated C/Cython code.", "keywords": ["indexing", "type analysis", "code generation", "Cython", "compile‑time evaluation", "buffer handling", "C array", "C function", "C++ object", "Python object", "fused types", "none check", "type inference"], "summary_hash": "b3950ee3fbec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:58:07+00:00"}
