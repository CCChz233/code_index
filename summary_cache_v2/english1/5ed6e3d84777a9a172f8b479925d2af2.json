{"summary": "The module provides the core infrastructure for visualising Qiskit execution timelines. It defines an abstract plotting interface that manages canvas creation, primitive drawing, image extraction and export, and supplies a concrete Matplotlib‑based implementation that maps timeline drawing objects to Matplotlib primitives, builds figures and axes, and renders or saves the timeline visualisations.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to generate clear visual representations of quantum circuit execution schedules for debugging, performance analysis, and presentation purposes.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "timeline", "visualization", "plotting", "abstract base", "Matplotlib", "rendering", "export", "execution schedule", "canvas"], "summary_hash": "b2354cd0ce6e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:05:46+00:00"}
