{"summary": "The module defines a suite of unit tests that verify the correct operation of an NVTX range decorator used for performance profiling. It checks the decorator's behavior as a context manager, its integration with loss functions, neural network forward passes, and its interaction with a variety of MONAI data transformation utilities across different data types.", "business_intent": "Validate that the profiling decorator reliably marks code regions for NVTX tracing, ensuring accurate performance measurement in deep-learning workflows and data preprocessing pipelines.", "keywords": ["NVTX", "decorator", "performance profiling", "unit testing", "context manager", "loss computation", "neural network", "MONAI transforms", "PyTorch", "CuPy", "data preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "bd2c5c930267", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:33:41+00:00"}
