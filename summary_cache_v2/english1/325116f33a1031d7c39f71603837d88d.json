{"summary": "This module implements the core framework for executing Ansible sanity test suites. It defines abstractions for representing test outcomes, processing ignore directives, managing collections of test targets, and orchestrating test execution across single or multiple Python interpreter versions. The implementation also includes utilities for virtual‑environment handling, dependency verification, and result aggregation.", "business_intent": "Provide a robust, version‑aware infrastructure that runs Ansible sanity checks, respects ignore/skip rules, prepares appropriate Python environments, and reports success or failure to ensure code quality and compatibility across supported Python releases.", "keywords": ["Ansible", "sanity testing", "test framework", "Python version compatibility", "ignore processing", "virtual environment", "test targets", "result aggregation", "plugin architecture", "multi‑version execution"], "summary_hash": "01fe5834e8a3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:55:33+00:00"}
