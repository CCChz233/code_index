{"summary": "Implements a hybrid model that merges a graph neural network with gradient‑boosted decision trees to improve semi‑supervised node classification or regression. Manages the creation of both GNN and GBDT components, coordinates alternating training phases of back‑propagation and tree fitting, optionally enriches node features with tree outputs, sets up optimizers, applies early‑stopping, and offers evaluation and inference utilities.", "business_intent": "Enable practitioners to achieve higher predictive accuracy on graph‑structured data by leveraging boosting techniques alongside deep GNNs, supporting applications such as recommendation, fraud detection, and biological network analysis.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "GNN", "gradient boosted decision trees", "GBDT", "boosting", "semi-supervised learning", "node classification", "node regression", "graph data", "feature augmentation", "early stopping", "training loop", "prediction", "deep learning", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "af1874646a6c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:14:49+00:00"}
