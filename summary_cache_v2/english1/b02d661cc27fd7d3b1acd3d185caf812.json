{"summary": "This module defines a container class that manages ionization state information for a collection of elements or isotopes. It stores fractional ionic abundances, relative elemental abundances, and a scaling density, and can compute absolute number densities using optional electron temperature and non‑thermal kappa parameters. The class behaves like a dictionary for accessing or updating individual species, validates normalization, supports tolerant equality checks, and provides utilities such as average ion charge.", "business_intent": "Facilitates plasma and astrophysical modeling workflows by providing a robust, programmatic way to represent and manipulate multi‑species ionization distributions, enabling downstream calculations of densities, emissivities, and charge‑state‑dependent processes in research, simulation, and diagnostic software.", "keywords": ["ionization state", "plasma modeling", "particle collection", "fractional abundances", "relative abundances", "density scaling", "electron temperature", "kappa distribution", "average ion charge", "dictionary-like access", "normalization validation"], "summary_hash": "487a9d19545c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:04:42+00:00"}
