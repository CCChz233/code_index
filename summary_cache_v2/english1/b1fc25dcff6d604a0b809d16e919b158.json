{"summary": "A fast ELECTRA tokenizer built on HuggingFace's tokenizers library that implements WordPiece subword segmentation. It loads a vocabulary file and provides configurable preprocessing options such as lower‑casing, text cleaning, Chinese character handling, accent stripping, and special token definitions (CLS, SEP, PAD, MASK, UNK). The tokenizer produces token IDs, attention masks, and token type IDs suitable for ELECTRA‑based models.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑performance preprocessing of raw text for ELECTRA models, allowing developers to efficiently convert sentences into token sequences with appropriate special tokens and metadata for downstream NLP tasks like classification, question answering, and language modeling.", "keywords": ["ELECTRA", "fast tokenizer", "WordPiece", "HuggingFace", "vocabulary", "special tokens", "lowercasing", "text cleaning", "Chinese characters", "accent stripping", "subword prefix"], "summary_hash": "4abd05d86439", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:17:52+00:00"}
