{"summary": "A dictionary‑based transform that injects synthetic spike artifacts into the k‑space representation of MRI data. It randomly selects specified entries (e.g., images) and, with a configurable probability, adds localized spikes whose log‑intensity is sampled from user‑defined ranges, optionally per channel.", "business_intent": "Generate realistic MRI artifact variations during training to increase model robustness and generalization to scans affected by spike noise, thereby improving diagnostic performance in clinical imaging pipelines.", "keywords": ["k-space", "spike artifact", "MRI augmentation", "randomized transform", "dictionary input", "intensity range", "channel‑wise", "probability", "medical imaging", "data augmentation"], "summary_hash": "f5b204a47e70", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:55:15+00:00"}
