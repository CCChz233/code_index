{"summary": "The Kedro runner module provides a set of classes and utilities for executing data pipelines. It includes an abstract base runner that handles common execution logic such as executor acquisition, worker count calculation, logging, error handling, dataset lifecycle management, validation, and resumable runs. Concrete implementations include a sequential runner for ordered node execution, a thread-based runner for parallel execution using threads, and a parallel runner that utilizes multiprocessing for parallel execution. The module also defines a task abstraction that manages node execution, data retrieval, bootstrapping, input aggregation, hook invocation, and synchronization across different execution strategies.", "business_intent": "To enable flexible and reliable execution of Kedro pipelines by providing a reusable abstract runner framework and concrete runner implementations that support sequential, threaded, and multiprocessing execution modes, ensuring proper handling of dependencies, resources, and error management.", "keywords": ["Kedro", "pipeline execution", "abstract runner", "sequential runner", "threaded runner", "parallel runner", "task abstraction", "dependency management", "concurrency", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "8427ad6a9e33", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:22:25+00:00"}
