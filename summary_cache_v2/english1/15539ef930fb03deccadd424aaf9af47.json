{"summary": "Implements a cross‑encoder component that loads a transformer‑based sequence classification model to jointly encode two texts, producing either a similarity score or a categorical label. It handles tokenization, truncation, device placement, training loops, evaluation, inference, ranking of candidates, model persistence, and integration with the HuggingFace model hub.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use solution for developers to apply transformer models to pairwise text tasks such as similarity measurement, duplicate detection, and ranking, accelerating development of semantic search and related applications.", "keywords": ["cross-encoder", "transformer", "sequence classification", "sentence pair", "similarity scoring", "ranking", "training", "inference", "tokenization", "device management", "model saving", "hub integration", "PyTorch", "HuggingFace"], "summary_hash": "c6af1ec5bacf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:51:26+00:00"}
