{"summary": "Provides an end‑to‑end diffusion pipeline that merges a UNet denoiser with a variance‑exploding Score SDE scheduler to generate images from pure random noise in an unconditional manner. The pipeline handles model loading, device allocation, and runs the iterative denoising loop to produce final image tensors.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to quickly incorporate state‑of‑the‑art Score SDE VE image generation into their applications or experiments without building the underlying diffusion mechanics from scratch.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "Score SDE", "variance exploding", "UNet", "image synthesis", "unconditional generation", "pipeline", "model loading", "device placement", "latent denoising"], "summary_hash": "1f33d588a496", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:43:52+00:00"}
