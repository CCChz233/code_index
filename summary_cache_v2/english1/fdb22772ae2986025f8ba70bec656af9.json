{"summary": "The module implements a load‑test harness that drives an asynchronous LLM routing component with concurrent requests while measuring its memory consumption using memory_profiler. It sets up environment variables, creates a thread pool for parallel execution, and records memory usage over time to assess the router's scalability and detect potential leaks.", "business_intent": "To evaluate and ensure the scalability and stability of the LLM routing service under high‑throughput conditions by profiling its memory behavior, helping developers identify performance bottlenecks or memory leaks before production deployment.", "keywords": ["litellm", "router", "async completion", "memory profiling", "load testing", "performance", "memory usage", "concurrency", "asyncio", "thread pool"], "summary_hash": "a2cb6ec3f9b0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:16:11+00:00"}
