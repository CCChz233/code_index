{"summary": "The module defines a Grid class that builds and manages a ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System) domain, generating the horizontal layout, land‑sea mask, bathymetry, and vertical stretching based on user‑provided dimensions, geographic location, rotation, and topography source. It includes validation, visualization, and saving to files or YAML, and supports later updates to bathymetry or vertical parameters.", "business_intent": "To provide ocean modelers with a streamlined, reliable way to configure and generate ROMS model grids, ensuring correct spatial geometry, masking, depth fields, and vertical coordinate systems, while facilitating visualization and reproducible configuration storage for simulation workflows.", "keywords": ["ROMS", "grid generation", "ocean modeling", "bathymetry", "land-sea mask", "vertical stretching", "coordinate transformation", "visualization", "YAML configuration", "data persistence"], "summary_hash": "1b8e5c830736", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:15:45+00:00"}
