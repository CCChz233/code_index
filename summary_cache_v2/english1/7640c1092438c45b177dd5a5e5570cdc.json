{"summary": "Applies a configurable motion blur filter to batched 2‑D images (tensor of shape B×C×H×W). The filter is generated from an odd‑sized kernel rotated by a specified angle and weighted by a direction parameter; padding and interpolation options control border handling and kernel rotation.", "business_intent": "Enables realistic motion‑blur augmentation or preprocessing in deep‑learning pipelines, helping models become robust to motion artifacts or creating visual effects.", "keywords": ["motion blur", "image augmentation", "convolution", "kernel rotation", "directional blur", "padding", "interpolation", "PyTorch", "computer vision", "tensor"], "summary_hash": "b8489a99bf92", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:44:28+00:00"}
