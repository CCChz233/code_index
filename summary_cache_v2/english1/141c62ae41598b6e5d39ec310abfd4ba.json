{"summary": "A collection of command‑line training utilities for fine‑tuning Stable Diffusion and Stable Diffusion XL text‑to‑image models. The scripts handle dataset loading and caption tokenization, model preparation (including optional LoRA adapters), loss scheduling with a custom Huber loss, optimizer and learning‑rate configuration, EMA, distributed execution via Accelerate/DeepSpeed, periodic validation, checkpointing, and optional publishing to the Hugging Face hub.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and developers with ready‑to‑use, scalable pipelines for customizing state‑of‑the‑art text‑to‑image diffusion models, enabling efficient experimentation with loss functions and parameter‑efficient adapters while simplifying model sharing and deployment.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "diffusion models", "Stable Diffusion", "Stable Diffusion XL", "scheduled Huber loss", "LoRA adapters", "fine‑tuning", "distributed training", "Accelerate", "DeepSpeed", "dataset preprocessing", "tokenization", "EMA", "checkpointing", "Hugging Face hub"], "summary_hash": "829b9246447d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:39:29+00:00"}
