{"summary": "Provides a command‑line utility that transforms a plain list of audio file paths into a JSON manifest suitable for speaker embedding training. It can also post‑process an existing manifest to filter speakers, split the data into training and development sets, and optionally generate shorter random‑duration audio segments, writing the resulting files to the current directory.", "business_intent": "Automate the creation and preparation of speaker recognition training data, enabling efficient dataset generation, balancing, and augmentation for machine‑learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["audio manifest", "speaker labeling", "filelist conversion", "train/dev split", "random segment generation", "duration filtering", "data preprocessing", "speech recognition", "Nemo", "StratifiedShuffleSplit"], "summary_hash": "d699eba40c9e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:44:23+00:00"}
