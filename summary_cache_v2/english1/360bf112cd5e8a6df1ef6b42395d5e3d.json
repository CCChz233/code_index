{"summary": "This module supplies the core utilities for managing keypoint annotations within the Albumentations image augmentation framework. It defines a configuration class that specifies how keypoints are interpreted (coordinate order, scale, orientation, visibility, angle units, linked label fields) and a processor class that validates keypoint data, filters out invalid entries, assigns default field names, and converts keypoints between Albumentations' internal format and external representations. Additional helper functions handle angle normalization and basic keypoint checks.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to reliably incorporate keypoint data (e.g., landmarks, joint positions) into augmentation pipelines, ensuring correct formatting, validation, and transformation handling while maintaining compatibility with Albumentations' data structures.", "keywords": ["keypoints", "annotation", "validation", "conversion", "filtering", "configuration", "Albumentations", "image augmentation", "angle normalization", "visibility handling", "scale", "orientation"], "summary_hash": "c9ad563cf1d1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:27:51+00:00"}
