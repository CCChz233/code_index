{"summary": "Applies a spatial crop to dictionary entries, extracting a region of interest of either a fixed size or a randomly sampled size within specified bounds. The crop can be centered randomly or at the image center, respects per‑dimension size limits, and can operate lazily for deferred execution.", "business_intent": "Provides data augmentation and preprocessing for deep‑learning pipelines, especially in medical imaging, by generating varied sub‑volumes from larger images to improve model robustness and reduce memory usage.", "keywords": ["random cropping", "region of interest", "dictionary transform", "spatial crop", "lazy execution", "data augmentation", "medical imaging", "ROI size constraints", "random center", "allow missing keys"], "summary_hash": "03aabb971fb1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:04:31+00:00"}
