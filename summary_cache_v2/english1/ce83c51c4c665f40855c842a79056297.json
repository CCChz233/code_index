{"summary": "The module defines a callable component that automatically injects simulated user interactions, such as click points, into each iteration of an Ignite engine during Deepgrow model training or evaluation. It optionally applies transforms to the interaction data, limits the number of interactions per sample, and records interaction probabilities under a configurable dictionary key.", "business_intent": "Enable hands‑free, reproducible training and evaluation of Deepgrow interactive segmentation models by programmatically generating user input, thereby reducing manual effort and facilitating automated pipelines within the MONAI framework.", "keywords": ["Deepgrow", "simulated interaction", "user clicks", "Ignite engine", "MONAI", "training automation", "evaluation automation", "segmentation", "transform pipeline", "interaction probability", "max interaction limit"], "summary_hash": "3f0fa9e74c2a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:25:37+00:00"}
