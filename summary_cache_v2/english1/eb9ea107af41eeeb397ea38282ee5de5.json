{"summary": "The module supplies core abstract model classes for natural‑language processing in the NeMo framework. It centralises common functionality such as encoder‑decoder composition, tokenizer and vocabulary handling, checkpoint management, artifact registration and integration with NeMo’s saving/restoring and model‑parallel utilities, enabling derived seq2seq models to share a consistent configuration and training workflow.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, standardized foundation that accelerates development, training and deployment of NLP models—especially encoder‑decoder and other sequence‑to‑sequence architectures—by abstracting repetitive engineering tasks and ensuring compatibility with NeMo’s ecosystem.", "keywords": ["NLP", "encoder-decoder", "seq2seq", "base model", "tokenizer", "vocabulary", "checkpoint", "model parallel", "NeMo", "artifact registration", "saving", "restoring"], "summary_hash": "8dd287f09b40", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:08:05+00:00"}
