{"summary": "The module defines a mixin that equips transformer‑based NLP models with lightweight adapter capabilities, offering methods to add, configure, load, save, merge, and manage adapter weights, including support for parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning features such as selective layer activation and weight tying. It also provides a helper for adjusting parameter name prefixes during state‑dict operations.", "business_intent": "Enable easy integration and management of adapter modules for NLP models to facilitate efficient fine‑tuning, model customization, and deployment while handling persistence and merging of adapter weights.", "keywords": ["adapter", "PEFT", "transformer", "NLP", "mixin", "load", "save", "merge", "weight tying", "selective activation", "state dict", "prefix replacement", "parameter-efficient fine-tuning"], "summary_hash": "c2999d2d30b9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:20:29+00:00"}
