{"summary": "This module implements the core data models and backend logic for a mock Secrets Manager service. It defines objects representing secrets with version control, replication handling, lifecycle states, and associated metadata. The backend class orchestrates creation, retrieval, updating, deletion, rotation, replication, policy enforcement, and tagging of secrets, while a lightweight store class provides dictionary‑like access to secret key‑value pairs. Helper utilities support filtering and identifier parsing.", "business_intent": "To provide a fully functional in‑memory simulation of AWS Secrets Manager, enabling developers to write and run tests that involve secure storage, rotation, and management of confidential data without accessing real AWS resources.", "keywords": ["secrets", "versioning", "replication", "lifecycle", "rotation", "policy", "tagging", "backend", "mock", "AWS", "testing", "storage", "retrieval", "deletion"], "summary_hash": "a595729153d5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:48:03+00:00"}
