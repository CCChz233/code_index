{"summary": "The module defines a notebook‑oriented runner that simplifies launching Metaflow flow runs from a Jupyter notebook cell. It wraps the standard Metaflow Runner with sensible defaults for notebook environments, automatically determines the current cell, manages temporary directories, and ensures cleanup after execution. An accompanying exception class signals initialization failures.", "business_intent": "Allow data scientists and analysts to execute Metaflow workflows directly within interactive notebooks without manual configuration, while handling resource management and error reporting transparently.", "keywords": ["Metaflow", "Jupyter notebook", "NBRunner", "flow execution", "temporary directory", "automatic cleanup", "cell detection", "exception handling"], "summary_hash": "260432768ff9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:05:02+00:00"}
