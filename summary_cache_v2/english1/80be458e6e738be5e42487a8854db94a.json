{"summary": "The module implements differentiable loss functions that combine Dice similarity with connectivity constraints for training segmentation models of tubular structures. It provides utilities for soft Dice computation and soft morphological operations (dilation, erosion, opening, skeletonization) and defines two loss classes that integrate these components to enforce topology‑preserving segmentation.", "business_intent": "To improve deep‑learning based medical image segmentation of vessels, ducts, and other tube‑like anatomy by providing loss functions that preserve structural connectivity during model optimization.", "keywords": ["clDice", "loss function", "segmentation", "tubular structures", "connectivity", "Dice similarity", "soft morphological operations", "skeletonization", "medical imaging", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "ef5a4d59b413", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:15:18+00:00"}
