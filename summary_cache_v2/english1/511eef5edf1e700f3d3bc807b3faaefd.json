{"summary": "Implements a Matplotlib‑based renderer that converts a Qiskit QuantumCircuit into a 2‑D schematic diagram. It computes wire coordinates, determines gate symbols, colors, and annotations, and draws various quantum operations—including standard gates, controls, measurements, barriers, swaps, and control‑flow constructs—while applying configurable styling. Includes a data container for per‑node drawing metadata.", "business_intent": "Enable Qiskit users to generate clear, customizable visual representations of quantum circuits for debugging, analysis, documentation, and presentation, leveraging Matplotlib's plotting capabilities.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit visualization", "Matplotlib", "circuit drawer", "layout computation", "gate rendering", "control flow", "measurement", "barrier", "swap", "styling", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "f193f7c6f37e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:03:03+00:00"}
