{"summary": "The module implements a complete example for node classification using a GraphSAGE architecture built with DGL and PyTorch. It defines a model wrapper, prepares benchmark datasets, and provides training, evaluation, and inference pipelines that leverage neighbor sampling and multi‑layer full‑neighbor sampling.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run reference implementation that helps practitioners and developers quickly apply GraphSAGE to graph‑structured data for node classification tasks, benchmark performance on standard datasets, and serve as a template for integrating graph neural networks into production workflows.", "keywords": ["GraphSAGE", "node classification", "DGL", "PyTorch", "graph neural network", "neighbor sampling", "OGB", "training loop", "evaluation", "inference"], "summary_hash": "87a03b536569", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:17:21+00:00"}
