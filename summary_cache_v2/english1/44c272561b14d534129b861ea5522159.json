{"summary": "This module implements the internal machinery that powers Dask DataFrame's high‑level methods. It provides a collection of helper routines that translate pandas‑style operations—such as cumulative aggregations, descriptive statistics, indexing, assignment, sampling, and value counting—into the chunk‑aggregate‑combine workflow required for distributed execution. The functions handle data‑type checks, partitioning, and result concatenation, enabling lazy, parallel computation over large datasets.", "business_intent": "To extend pandas‑like DataFrame capabilities to a distributed environment, allowing users to perform common data manipulation and analysis tasks on out‑of‑core or cluster‑scale data with Dask's parallel execution model.", "keywords": ["dask", "dataframe", "parallel computation", "lazy evaluation", "aggregation", "cumulative operations", "indexing", "assignment", "sampling", "descriptive statistics", "value counts", "pandas compatibility"], "summary_hash": "113acf4e0acc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:20:26+00:00"}
