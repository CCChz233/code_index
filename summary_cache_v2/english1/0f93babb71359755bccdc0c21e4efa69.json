{"summary": "This module provides utilities for associating well observations with model layers. It includes functions to compute geometric overlaps between well trajectories and grid cells, locate wells within a spatial grid, and perform vectorized overlap calculations to efficiently assign wells to the appropriate geological layers.", "business_intent": "Enable preprocessing of well data for subsurface or groundwater models by determining which model layers each well intersects, facilitating accurate integration of observational data into simulation workflows.", "keywords": ["well assignment", "layer overlap", "spatial indexing", "grid location", "hydrogeology", "geospatial analysis", "numpy", "pandas", "xarray", "xugrid"], "summary_hash": "2649e2575413", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:46:03+00:00"}
