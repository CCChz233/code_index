{"summary": "A unit‑test suite dedicated to validating the ViTMSN vision transformer model. It prepares test fixtures, checks the model's configuration, runs inference on image classification data, verifies handling of embedding inputs (while omitting typical NLP inputs), ensures core model attributes are present, and confirms that pretrained weights can be loaded correctly.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the ViTMSN model functions reliably for image classification tasks, adheres to its expected configuration and attribute contract, and can be instantiated from pretrained checkpoints without relying on unsupported input types.", "keywords": ["ViTMSN", "vision transformer", "unit testing", "image classification", "model configuration", "pretrained weights", "embedding inputs", "model validation"], "summary_hash": "0cb61c20e029", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:15:56+00:00"}
