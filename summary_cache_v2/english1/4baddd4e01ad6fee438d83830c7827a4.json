{"summary": "A utility that instruments a neural network model with forward hooks to monitor the absolute minimum and maximum values of weights, inputs, and outputs during each forward pass. It records a configurable number of recent frames and raises an exception when NaN or infinite values appear, printing the recent frames to pinpoint the layer where numerical instability originated. It also supports a tracing mode that logs per‑batch min/max statistics for selected batches and can abort training after a specified batch.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to detect and diagnose numerical underflow/overflow issues in deep learning models, especially under mixed‑precision training, by providing detailed layer‑wise value ranges and early stopping capabilities, thereby improving model stability and reducing debugging time.", "keywords": ["debugging", "underflow", "overflow", "nan", "inf", "forward hook", "min max tracing", "batch tracing", "early abort", "numerical stability", "mixed precision"], "summary_hash": "2b7c99eb19d6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:20:11+00:00"}
