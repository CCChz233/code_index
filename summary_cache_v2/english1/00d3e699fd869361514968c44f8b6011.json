{"summary": "The class constructs a multi‑scale image pyramid by iteratively applying Gaussian smoothing and down‑sampling, optionally prepending an up‑scaled image, to produce a hierarchy of images together with the corresponding scale (sigma) and pixel‑distance conversion factors.", "business_intent": "Facilitate robust local feature detection and matching (e.g., SIFT) by providing a consistent multi‑scale representation of input images for downstream computer‑vision pipelines.", "keywords": ["scale pyramid", "Gaussian blur", "image downsampling", "multi‑scale representation", "local feature detection", "SIFT", "computer vision", "PyTorch", "octave", "sigma", "pixel distance"], "summary_hash": "cec584d644d4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:04:42+00:00"}
