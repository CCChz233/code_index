{"summary": "Encapsulates a left and right PCR primer that together define an amplicon, ensuring both primers reside on the same chromosome. Provides access to the expected amplicon sequence, its melting temperature, penalty score, and optional naming. Supplies utilities for computing the amplicon span, length, base composition, comparing pairs, extracting inner regions, and exporting the pair in BED12 format, as well as adding custom names or tail sequences.", "business_intent": "Support primer design and analysis pipelines by representing and evaluating primer pairs, allowing downstream selection of optimal pairs based on thermodynamic properties and genomic coordinates.", "keywords": ["primer pair", "PCR", "amplicon", "melting temperature", "penalty score", "genomic coordinates", "BED12", "bioinformatics", "primer design"], "summary_hash": "8230e7f67ec8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:11:53+00:00"}
