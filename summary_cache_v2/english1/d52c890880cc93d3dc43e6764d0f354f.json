{"summary": "Implements a guided source separation estimator that computes time‑frequency masks for multi‑microphone audio using an EM‑based complex angular Central Gaussian Mixture Model. The estimator iteratively refines mixture weights, shape matrices and masks, applying regularization and normalization to produce reliable mask outputs given source activity information.", "business_intent": "Enable robust speech enhancement and source separation in noisy, reverberant environments such as conference or dinner‑party recordings, supporting downstream applications like automatic speech recognition or audio analytics.", "keywords": ["mask estimation", "guided source separation", "complex angular CGMM", "EM algorithm", "microphone array", "speech enhancement", "source activity", "mixture weights", "shape matrix", "iterative refinement"], "summary_hash": "427491b2d8e5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:12:45+00:00"}
