{"summary": "The package implements a unified interface for collective communication used by Lightning Fabric plugins. It defines an abstract contract for group management and tensor exchange, provides a single‑device implementation that emulates distributed primitives locally, and wraps PyTorch’s distributed backend to expose a consistent API for operations such as broadcast, gather, reduce and scatter.", "business_intent": "Enable Lightning Fabric to support scalable multi‑process and multi‑node training by abstracting away the details of the underlying communication library, while also allowing seamless operation on a single device for development or debugging.", "keywords": ["collective communication", "distributed training", "Lightning Fabric", "process group", "broadcast", "gather", "reduce", "scatter", "single-device fallback", "PyTorch distributed"], "summary_hash": "02e627ed5869", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:15:15+00:00"}
