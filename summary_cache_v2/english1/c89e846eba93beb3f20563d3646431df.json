{"summary": "The class orchestrates a pipeline of image transformations, accepting various input types and producing a single image tensor while offering built-in visualization and file‑saving capabilities. It can toggle optional memory‑intensive features to preserve the original lightweight behavior.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to construct end‑to‑end image processing workflows with automatic visual output and persistence, simplifying integration of sequential image operations in machine‑learning or computer‑vision applications.", "keywords": ["image processing", "sequential pipeline", "visualization", "file saving", "memory management", "tensor output", "feature toggle"], "summary_hash": "67ca142e999a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:49:05+00:00"}
