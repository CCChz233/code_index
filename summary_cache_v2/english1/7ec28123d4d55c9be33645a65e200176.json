{"summary": "A suite of scripts that orchestrate the extraction, comparison, and visualisation of health‑system simulation outputs against observed data for calibration purposes. They load scenario results, align metrics such as mortality, disability, demographics, and appointment usage with reference datasets, generate tables, charts, and legends, and bundle the artifacts for review.", "business_intent": "Enable model developers and analysts to validate and fine‑tune the simulation model by providing calibrated evidence of how closely simulated health outcomes and service utilisation match real‑world benchmarks, facilitating reporting and decision‑making.", "keywords": ["calibration", "simulation analysis", "health system interaction", "cause of death", "disability-adjusted life years", "demographic validation", "appointment usage", "comparative visualization", "data aggregation", "report generation", "model validation"], "summary_hash": "9e13e8ca8949", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:04:49+00:00"}
