{"summary": "Provides a comprehensive test suite for the neural-network utilities in the library, exercising activation functions, softmax, attention mechanisms, one-hot encoding, and weight initializers. The tests verify functional correctness, gradient computation, datatype handling, edge-case behavior, and compatibility with CUDA/cuDNN backends.", "business_intent": "Guarantee reliable and numerically stable neural-network operations across different data types and hardware configurations, preventing regressions in core math primitives and initializer logic that could affect model training and inference.", "keywords": ["neural network", "activations", "softmax", "attention", "one-hot encoding", "weight initializers", "variance scaling", "type casting", "gradient checking", "JAX", "CUDA", "cuDNN", "parameterized testing", "edge cases"], "summary_hash": "a65baddd99c1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:04:24+00:00"}
