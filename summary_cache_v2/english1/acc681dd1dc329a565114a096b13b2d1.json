{"summary": "The script builds a regional groundwater model for the Hondsrug area in the northeast Netherlands using MODFLOW‑6. It ingests and preprocesses external spatial datasets such as topography, ditch networks, pipe drainage, and climate variables, converts them into a multi‑layer grid, assigns hydraulic properties to aquifers and aquitards, and sets up surface‑water and climate forcing for simulation.", "business_intent": "To provide a reproducible, end‑to‑end example that enables hydrogeologists, water‑resource managers, and planners to evaluate groundwater flow dynamics, assess the influence of drainage infrastructure, and support decision‑making for water management in the Hondsrug region.", "keywords": ["groundwater modeling", "MODFLOW6", "regional model", "Hondsrug", "Netherlands", "aquifer", "aquitard", "ditch network", "pipe drainage", "precipitation", "evapotranspiration", "data preprocessing", "Python", "imod", "xarray", "numpy", "pandas", "scipy"], "summary_hash": "8243b1006178", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:06:47+00:00"}
