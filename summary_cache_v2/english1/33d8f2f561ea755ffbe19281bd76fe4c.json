{"summary": "A dataset class that reads a manifest describing input, target, and optional reference audio files, loads them at a specified sample rate, and returns synchronized or independent audio segments. It supports configurable keys, optional fixed or random sub‑segment durations, channel selection, length filtering, maximum utterance limits, and optional normalization based on a chosen signal.", "business_intent": "Enable training and evaluation of audio‑to‑audio models that leverage an auxiliary reference recording, such as speech enhancement, echo cancellation, or multi‑sensor audio reconstruction, by providing a flexible, filtered, and normalized data pipeline.", "keywords": ["audio dataset", "input‑target mapping", "reference audio", "manifest loading", "sample rate", "segment duration", "random offset", "channel selection", "synchronization", "normalization", "speech enhancement", "echo cancellation", "multi‑sensor fusion"], "summary_hash": "73592357a82f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:15:29+00:00"}
