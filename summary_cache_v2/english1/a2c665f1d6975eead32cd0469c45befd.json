{"summary": "This module supplies low‑level ctypes prototypes and associated utilities that let Django’s GIS layer call GDAL C functions safely. It builds function signatures, attaches error‑checking callbacks, and wraps geometry and spatial reference system operations, converting GDAL error codes into Django GIS exceptions and Python objects.", "business_intent": "To provide a reliable bridge between Django’s GIS framework and the GDAL library, enabling Python code to invoke GDAL functionality with proper type definitions and error handling, thereby supporting spatial data processing within Django applications.", "keywords": ["Django", "GIS", "GDAL", "ctypes", "function prototypes", "error handling", "geometry", "spatial reference system", "C library bindings"], "summary_hash": "7505613cc443", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:33:51+00:00"}
