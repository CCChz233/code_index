{"summary": "The module defines a suite of custom data transforms used in MONAI's DeepEdit application. These transforms generate and manipulate guidance information such as point‑based cues, Gaussian‑blurred guidance channels, random seed points, and discrepancy regions, as well as utilities for slice selection, label normalization, and resizing to keep guidance aligned with image transformations. They are designed to prepare and augment data for interactive deep learning‑based medical image segmentation workflows.", "business_intent": "Enable an interactive deep learning segmentation pipeline for medical imaging by providing automated generation, augmentation, and alignment of user guidance signals and label data, facilitating model training and inference that can incorporate corrective clicks and seed points.", "keywords": ["deep edit", "medical imaging", "interactive segmentation", "data transforms", "guidance points", "seed point generation", "discrepancy detection", "label normalization", "slice selection", "resizing", "multi‑label"], "summary_hash": "821cb2fdaff0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:24:26+00:00"}
