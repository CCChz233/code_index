{"summary": "An abstract base class that defines the contract for tools used by an autonomous agent, specifying a human‑readable description, a performative name, expected input and output modalities, and requiring concrete subclasses to implement the execution logic. It also offers optional lifecycle hooks for expensive preparation and utilities for Gradio integration, model hub publishing, and persistence.", "business_intent": "To provide a standardized, extensible framework for packaging and deploying reusable functional components that agents can invoke, simplifying development, deployment, and sharing of AI‑driven capabilities.", "keywords": ["abstract base class", "agent tool", "modality specification", "execution contract", "extensibility", "deployment utilities", "gradio integration", "model hub", "persistence"], "summary_hash": "35e3eb8c608e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:32:17+00:00"}
