{"summary": "This module implements a FastAPI‑based layer that creates, configures, and manages generic pass‑through endpoints. It forwards incoming requests to external LLM services, handling request/response bodies, headers, streaming responses, and optional metadata tagging, while integrating with the proxy's logging and authentication mechanisms.", "business_intent": "Enable customers to expose custom proxy routes that simply relay calls to external AI providers, allowing flexible integration, custom routing, and centralized monitoring without modifying the core LLM handling logic.", "keywords": ["pass‑through", "proxy endpoint", "request forwarding", "streaming response", "header propagation", "metadata tagging", "FastAPI", "async HTTP", "custom routing", "logging", "authentication"], "summary_hash": "66646bb0a52f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:47:05+00:00"}
