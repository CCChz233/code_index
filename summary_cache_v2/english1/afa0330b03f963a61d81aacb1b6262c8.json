{"summary": "This test module validates the SpectrogramEnhancerModel used in text‑to‑speech pipelines. It provides helper utilities to instantiate the enhancer and its configuration, generate sample spectrogram inputs, and runs a suite of unit tests checking discriminator behavior, generator output dimensions, model serialization, padding handling, and spectrogram normalization/unnormalization, including interactions with a FastPitch component.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of the spectrogram enhancement component in speech synthesis systems, ensuring it preserves expected shapes, correctly processes padding and normalization, and can be reliably saved and restored.", "keywords": ["spectrogram enhancer", "text-to-speech", "unit testing", "PyTorch", "model serialization", "padding", "normalization", "discriminator", "generator", "FastPitch"], "summary_hash": "1c9799a0d249", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:27:37+00:00"}
