{"summary": "The module implements a high‑level wrapper around the Primer3 command‑line application. It loads a reference genome, optionally masks polymorphic sites using a variant lookup, constructs design regions, runs Primer3 as a subprocess, parses its output, and returns structured primer or primer‑pair results together with failure statistics. It also handles resource cleanup and can be used as a context manager.", "business_intent": "Enable automated, programmatic PCR primer design within bioinformatics pipelines by providing a convenient Python interface to Primer3 that integrates genome sequences, variant masking, and detailed result reporting.", "keywords": ["primer design", "PCR", "Primer3 integration", "subprocess management", "genome reference", "variant masking", "oligo construction", "primer pair generation", "failure analysis", "context manager", "bioinformatics"], "summary_hash": "9e0173be90ee", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:11:42+00:00"}
