{"summary": "Provides a thread‑safe, awaitable synchronization primitive for asynchronous code. The object can be signaled and queried for its state, and tasks can wait until it becomes signaled. It does not bind to a specific event loop at creation and deliberately omits a clear operation, requiring a new instance for resetting.", "business_intent": "Enable safe coordination between concurrent asynchronous tasks across threads without relying on a particular event loop, simplifying synchronization patterns and avoiding bugs related to accidental resets.", "keywords": ["async", "event", "thread-safe", "synchronization", "awaitable", "concurrency", "signal", "wait", "no clear", "anyio", "asyncio"], "summary_hash": "b9baa2eeadd9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:35:59+00:00"}
