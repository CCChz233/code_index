{"summary": "Implements a residual module that processes input features through two convolution‑activation‑normalization stages, incorporates SPADE (spatially‑adaptive denormalization) conditioned on semantic label maps, and adds a skip connection to produce the final output.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable building block for generative or segmentation‑aware networks that require semantic conditioning, enabling more precise and controllable image synthesis or feature transformation.", "keywords": ["residual block", "SPADE", "spatially-adaptive denormalization", "semantic conditioning", "convolution", "activation", "group normalization", "deep learning", "image synthesis", "generator"], "summary_hash": "f4e67a2e3133", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:43:58+00:00"}
