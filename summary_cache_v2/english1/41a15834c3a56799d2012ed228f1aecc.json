{"summary": "A collection of unit‑test suites that exercise the ImpactPacket library’s handling of various network protocols (IPv6, ICMPv6, TCP, Ethernet). The tests construct packets, encode them into raw bytes, decode them back, and verify fields, checksums, extensions, and edge‑case behaviours against known reference data.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and stability of the packet‑processing components used in networking applications, enabling developers to detect regressions, validate protocol compliance, and maintain high‑quality code for packet creation and parsing.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "ImpactPacket", "IPv6", "ICMPv6", "TCP", "Ethernet", "packet encoding", "packet decoding", "protocol validation", "Impacket", "network protocols"], "summary_hash": "d7b26caed889", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:24:51+00:00"}
