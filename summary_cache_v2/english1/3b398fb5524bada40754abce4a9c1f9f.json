{"summary": "The module contains a comprehensive unit‑test suite that verifies the functionality of model hooks in the Accelerate library. It checks that hooks can be attached, detached and sequenced correctly, that pre‑forward and post‑forward hooks run at the appropriate times, that gradient settings are respected, and that device‑alignment hooks work for CPU offload and model‑parallel scenarios.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correctness of hook mechanisms used during model training and inference, ensuring reliable integration of custom preprocessing, post‑processing, and device‑placement logic across multi‑device environments.", "keywords": ["hooks", "model", "pre-forward", "post-forward", "device alignment", "CPU offload", "model parallelism", "unit testing", "accelerate", "torch"], "summary_hash": "f86fead2a90b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:14:00+00:00"}
