{"summary": "Partitions an input embedding into a configurable number of groups and applies a finite‑scalar quantizer to each group independently, while sharing the same quantization level configuration across groups. It manages codebook dimensions, sizes per group, and provides encoding, decoding, and forward operations on the grouped representation.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the use of group‑based residual vector quantization in high‑fidelity audio codecs and similar compression systems, offering a convenient way to apply consistent scalar quantization across multiple sub‑vectors without manual bookkeeping.", "keywords": ["grouped quantization", "finite scalar quantizer", "codebook management", "vector splitting", "audio codec compression", "HiFi‑Codec", "residual vector quantization", "embedding dimension", "neural compression"], "summary_hash": "68bea2111a23", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:37:54+00:00"}
