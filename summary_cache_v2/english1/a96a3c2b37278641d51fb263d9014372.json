{"summary": "Implements the GridDropout augmentation, which randomly masks square cells arranged in a grid over an image. The class integrates with Albumentations' dropout framework, offering configurable dropout probability, cell size, fill value, and per-channel handling, while using a pydantic schema for robust parameter validation.", "business_intent": "Enable computer‑vision models to learn more robust features by simulating occlusions and missing regions during training, thereby improving generalization and reducing overfitting.", "keywords": ["grid dropout", "image augmentation", "random masking", "computer vision", "data augmentation", "Albumentations", "pydantic validation", "dropout fill", "occlusion", "training robustness"], "summary_hash": "f539ef322883", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:29:03+00:00"}
