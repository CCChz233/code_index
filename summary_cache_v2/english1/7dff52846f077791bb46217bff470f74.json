{"summary": "Provides a hybrid learning framework that combines a graph neural network with gradient‑boosted decision trees for semi‑supervised node classification or regression on graph‑structured data. It builds and trains both GNN and GBDT components, alternates between back‑propagation and tree fitting, optionally augments node features with tree predictions, and includes utilities for optimization, early‑stopping, evaluation, and inference. An accompanying script prepares data (categorical encoding, normalization) using DGL and runs the BGNN predictor with PyTorch.", "business_intent": "Enable practitioners to achieve higher accuracy on graph‑based prediction tasks by leveraging the complementary strengths of deep graph neural networks and tree‑based models, reducing the need for extensive feature engineering and improving model robustness in semi‑supervised settings.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "gradient boosted decision trees", "semi-supervised learning", "node classification", "node regression", "PyTorch", "DGL", "hybrid model", "early stopping", "feature enrichment"], "summary_hash": "efb5671c23e2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:52:03+00:00"}
