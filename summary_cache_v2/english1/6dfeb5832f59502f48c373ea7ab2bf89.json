{"summary": "The module implements algorithms for constructing right‑angled paths through the Weyl alcove used in two‑qubit XX gate synthesis. It works with source and target canonical coordinates, interaction strength parameters, and pre‑computed polytope data to back‑solve for intermediate coordinates and generate feasible sequences of native interactions.", "business_intent": "Provide a computational foundation for efficient compilation of two‑qubit XX‑type operations by determining optimal interaction sequences, thereby reducing circuit depth and error rates in quantum hardware execution.", "keywords": ["quantum synthesis", "two-qubit gates", "XX decomposition", "Weyl alcove", "right-angled paths", "polytope data", "coordinate transformation", "circuit optimization", "native interactions", "monodromy polytope"], "summary_hash": "fdd896e711db", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:01:30+00:00"}
