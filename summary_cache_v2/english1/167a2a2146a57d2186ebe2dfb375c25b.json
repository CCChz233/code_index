{"summary": "Provides a high‑performance tokenizer for the LayoutLMv3 model, built on HuggingFace's tokenizers library and using byte‑pair encoding. It converts raw text into token IDs while managing special tokens, padding, masking, and associated bounding box coordinates, and supports configurable handling of subword labeling and offset trimming.", "business_intent": "Facilitates fast and accurate preprocessing of document text and layout information for downstream tasks such as document classification, information extraction, and question answering with LayoutLMv3.", "keywords": ["tokenization", "BPE", "fast tokenizer", "LayoutLMv3", "special tokens", "bounding boxes", "padding", "masking", "preprocessing", "HuggingFace"], "summary_hash": "7e1435a9bd80", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:45:17+00:00"}
