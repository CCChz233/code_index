{"summary": "The module implements an exponential moving average (EMA) mechanism for neural network training. It provides a training callback that maintains a shadow copy of model parameters updated with EMA, automatically swaps to these averaged weights during validation, testing, and inference, and integrates with checkpointing. An optimizer wrapper updates EMA weights after each optimizer step and offers a context manager for temporary weight swapping.", "business_intent": "To enhance model robustness and generalization by smoothing parameter updates through EMA, simplifying the integration of EMA into training pipelines, and ensuring consistent evaluation and deployment using averaged weights.", "keywords": ["exponential moving average", "EMA", "model parameters", "training callback", "optimizer wrapper", "weight swapping", "validation", "testing", "inference", "PyTorch Lightning", "checkpointing", "model stability", "generalization"], "summary_hash": "10504fb8a3da", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:51:20+00:00"}
