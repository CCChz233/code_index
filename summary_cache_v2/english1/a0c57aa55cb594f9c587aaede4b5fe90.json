{"summary": "Implements an end‑to‑end training pipeline for a ControlNet extension of Stable Diffusion XL. It defines a dataset that streams image‑caption pairs from WebDataset archives, applies preprocessing such as edge detection, depth estimation and tokenization, filters samples, and feeds them into a distributed training loop managed by Accelerate. The script loads the base diffusion model and ControlNet, configures optimizers and learning‑rate schedules, performs gradient accumulation, periodically validates by generating images, and saves checkpoints and model cards to Hugging Face.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and developers with a ready‑made solution to fine‑tune ControlNet models on large web‑scale datasets, accelerating the creation of conditional image generation systems and facilitating sharing of trained models and documentation on the Hugging Face platform.", "keywords": ["ControlNet", "Stable Diffusion XL", "WebDataset", "distributed training", "Accelerate", "image preprocessing", "edge detection", "depth estimation", "tokenization", "gradient accumulation", "validation", "checkpointing", "model card", "Hugging Face", "conditional image generation"], "summary_hash": "9840ad9df98d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:37:48+00:00"}
