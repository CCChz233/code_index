{"summary": "The module defines a class that translates an arbitrary isometric transformation between two quantum registers into a concrete quantum circuit. It implements the Iten et al. decomposition, handling full unitary synthesis and state‑preparation cases, and orchestrates the required diagonal, multi‑controlled, and uniformly controlled gate constructions.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable tool for quantum developers to generate efficient gate‑level implementations of any isometry, enabling the construction of custom unitaries and state‑preparation routines within Qiskit‑based quantum algorithms.", "keywords": ["isometry", "quantum circuit synthesis", "unitary decomposition", "state preparation", "multi-controlled gate", "uniformly controlled gate", "diagonal gate", "Qiskit", "quantum computing", "Iten algorithm"], "summary_hash": "2ddb9ff4ba81", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:15:01+00:00"}
