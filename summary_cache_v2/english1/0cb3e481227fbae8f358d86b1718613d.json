{"summary": "This test suite validates the image domain adaptation utilities provided by the Albumentations library, including histogram blending, histogram matching, and various scaling transformations (min‑max, standard, PCA). The tests cover a range of scenarios such as identity preservation, handling of different distributions, grayscale and multichannel images, shape and dtype compatibility, and proper inverse transformations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee reliable preprocessing of images for computer‑vision models by confirming that domain adaptation functions correctly adjust image statistics across datasets, thereby supporting robust model training and deployment.", "keywords": ["domain adaptation", "histogram matching", "histogram blending", "image scaling", "min‑max scaler", "standard scaler", "PCA transform", "image preprocessing", "computer vision", "unit testing", "Albumentations", "numpy", "scikit-image"], "summary_hash": "8a1db21ce6a3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:26:52+00:00"}
