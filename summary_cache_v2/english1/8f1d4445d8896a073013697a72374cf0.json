{"summary": "This module contains unit tests that verify the correct behavior of HE stain extraction and normalization transforms used in digital pathology workflows. The tests compare computed stain vectors and metrics against expected values, and also assess handling of transparent image regions.", "business_intent": "Validate the reliability of HE stain processing components to ensure accurate color deconvolution and consistent stain normalization for downstream pathology image analysis.", "keywords": ["unit test", "digital pathology", "HE stain extraction", "stain normalization", "MONAI", "image transforms", "color deconvolution", "transparent image handling", "numpy", "parameterized testing"], "summary_hash": "b52617651349", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:01:05+00:00"}
