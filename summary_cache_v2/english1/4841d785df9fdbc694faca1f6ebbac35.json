{"summary": "The remap package extends UXarray data structures with accessor methods and utilities that allow spatial data to be interpolated from a source grid onto a target grid. It supports simple interpolation schemes such as inverse‑distance weighting and nearest‑neighbor mapping, and includes helpers for parsing grid specifications and handling ancillary transformations.", "business_intent": "Provide a straightforward way for scientists and analysts to regrid geophysical datasets (e.g., climate, ocean) to different spatial resolutions, enabling seamless integration, comparison, and visualization across heterogeneous grid configurations.", "keywords": ["remap", "regrid", "interpolation", "inverse distance weighting", "nearest neighbor", "grid transformation", "UXarray", "spatial data", "accessor", "utility"], "summary_hash": "f593c8ab9319", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:30:53+00:00"}
