{"summary": "Metric serves as a foundational class for defining evaluation metrics in a deep‑learning framework. It manages internal state variables, provides utilities to add variables or weights, updates those variables with incoming data, computes the final scalar or dictionary result, and can reset its state. Subclasses implement the specific logic for each metric while leveraging the base class’s lifecycle and configuration handling.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to create, track, and report custom performance metrics during model training and evaluation, seamlessly integrating with the framework’s compile and fit APIs.", "keywords": ["metric", "stateful", "update_state", "result", "reset_state", "add_variable", "add_weight", "dtype", "configuration", "Keras", "model evaluation"], "summary_hash": "df8384c56a15", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:44:34+00:00"}
