{"summary": "Implements an encoding block that applies a series of convolutions followed by max‑pooling to reduce spatial dimensions while extracting features. The block also captures the pooling indices so they can be reused by the corresponding decoding stage for precise up‑sampling. Optional squeeze‑and‑excite and dropout layers can be inserted, and kernel size and filter count are configurable.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable component for the down‑sampling path of encoder‑decoder deep learning models, enabling efficient feature extraction and reversible pooling for later reconstruction in tasks such as segmentation or image generation.", "keywords": ["encoder", "convolution", "dense block", "downsampling", "max pooling", "pooling indices", "decoder", "upsampling", "squeeze-and-excite", "dropout", "kernel size", "filters", "neural network", "feature extraction"], "summary_hash": "643ae44f3ff9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:35:04+00:00"}
