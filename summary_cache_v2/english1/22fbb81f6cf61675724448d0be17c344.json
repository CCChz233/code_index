{"summary": "A collection of unit‑test modules that verify the functionality of various label source components in the Raster Vision framework, covering chip classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and the transformation between segmentation class indices and RGB colors. The tests assess initialization, configuration handling, geometry conversion, label map generation, and compatibility with legacy interfaces.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of label source implementations used for training and evaluating computer‑vision models in Raster Vision, thereby supporting reliable data preparation and model performance.", "keywords": ["unit tests", "label source", "chip classification", "object detection", "semantic segmentation", "segmentation class transformer", "configuration validation", "GeoJSON conversion", "raster vision", "computer vision testing"], "summary_hash": "381cd3270fbd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:03:20+00:00"}
