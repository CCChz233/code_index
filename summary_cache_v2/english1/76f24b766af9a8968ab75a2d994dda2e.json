{"summary": "The module implements a suite of array‑level transformations for spatial cropping, padding, and resizing of N‑dimensional image data. It supports deterministic and random cropping, label‑aware and foreground‑aware sampling, configurable padding modes, and lazy execution that defers actual data manipulation until later stages.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and efficient preprocessing and data augmentation of medical imaging datasets by providing configurable spatial crop/pad operations that can be integrated into training pipelines, improve memory usage through lazy evaluation, and support label‑guided sampling strategies.", "keywords": ["cropping", "padding", "spatial transform", "random crop", "label based crop", "lazy execution", "medical imaging", "preprocessing", "data augmentation", "array transform"], "summary_hash": "5d9de31026c9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:23:27+00:00"}
