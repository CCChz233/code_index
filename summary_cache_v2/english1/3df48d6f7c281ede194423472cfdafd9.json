{"summary": "Implements a quantum operation that applies Pauli rotations whose angles are determined by a piecewise‑linear function defined over the integer values of a set of state qubits. The class stores breakpoints, slopes and offsets, validates the configuration, prepares necessary ancilla registers, and provides utilities to evaluate and map the function for circuit synthesis.", "business_intent": "Enable algorithm designers to encode arbitrary piecewise‑linear amplitude or phase profiles into quantum circuits via controlled Pauli rotations, supporting tasks such as state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and variational ansätze.", "keywords": ["quantum", "piecewise linear", "Pauli rotation", "controlled rotation", "breakpoints", "slopes", "offsets", "quantum circuit", "state preparation", "variational ansatz"], "summary_hash": "addbd1c31f41", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:15:28+00:00"}
