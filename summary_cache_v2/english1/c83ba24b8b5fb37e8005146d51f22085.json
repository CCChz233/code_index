{"summary": "The script demonstrates an end‑to‑end workflow for training, evaluating, and performing inference with a BERT‑based text classification model using NVIDIA NeMo. It loads a configurable YAML file, allows command‑line overrides for dataset paths, number of classes, and training hyper‑parameters, runs the model with PyTorch Lightning, saves the trained model to a .nemo checkpoint, and shows how to restore and evaluate the saved model on new data.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example that enables developers to quickly build, train, assess, and deploy text classification solutions such as sentiment analysis or intent detection, with flexible configuration and checkpoint management.", "keywords": ["text classification", "BERT", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "training", "evaluation", "inference", "configuration", "checkpoint", "restore"], "summary_hash": "0c48e34298a1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:42:45+00:00"}
