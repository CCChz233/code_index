{"summary": "This module implements a diffusion pipeline that transforms textual prompts into animated video frames using the Stable Diffusion XL architecture. It orchestrates prompt encoding with dual CLIP text encoders, latent preparation, a conditional UNet denoising loop guided by various schedulers, classifier‑free guidance, optional LoRA/IP‑Adapter/textual‑inversion extensions, and VAE decoding, finally assembling the output as a video sequence. Helper utilities for noise rescaling and timestep handling are also provided.", "business_intent": "Offer developers and content creators a ready‑to‑use, extensible API for generating high‑quality AI‑driven video from text, streamlining creative workflows, rapid prototyping, and integration into media production pipelines.", "keywords": ["text-to-video", "stable diffusion XL", "diffusion pipeline", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "classifier-free guidance", "LoRA", "IP-Adapter", "textual inversion", "latent encoding", "video generation", "AI animation"], "summary_hash": "f7002057e398", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:19:05+00:00"}
