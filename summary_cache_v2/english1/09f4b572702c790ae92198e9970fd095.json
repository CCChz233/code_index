{"summary": "A reference script that demonstrates how to train a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement‑learning agent using PyTorch and Lightning Fabric. It parses command‑line arguments, creates a Gymnasium environment, builds the policy/value network, sets up optimizers and loss functions (policy, value, entropy), runs a distributed training loop with logging to TensorBoard, checkpointing, and periodic evaluation.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with a ready‑to‑run example for implementing and scaling PPO‑based RL training on multiple GPUs or nodes, illustrating best practices for distributed execution, monitoring, and evaluation within the Lightning ecosystem.", "keywords": ["PPO", "proximal policy optimization", "reinforcement learning", "Lightning Fabric", "PyTorch", "distributed training", "Gymnasium", "TensorBoard", "checkpointing", "policy gradient", "entropy regularization", "value function"], "summary_hash": "de8a747a6dd8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:50:21+00:00"}
