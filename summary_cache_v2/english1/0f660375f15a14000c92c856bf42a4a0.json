{"summary": "This module contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the GPU‑accelerated ndimage filtering functions provided by cupyx.scipy. It defines base utilities and multiple test classes that verify generic and fast filter implementations, handling of Fortran‑order arrays, one‑dimensional filters, invalid axes, modes, origins, special edge cases, weight data types, and internal algorithms such as ShellSort. The tests compare results against expected behavior to ensure correctness and robustness of the filtering operations.", "business_intent": "Validate and maintain the reliability of cupyx.scipy.ndimage filter functions, guaranteeing they produce correct results across diverse scenarios and match the reference SciPy behavior, thereby supporting stable GPU‑accelerated image processing in production applications.", "keywords": ["cupy", "scipy", "ndimage", "filter", "unit test", "GPU", "validation", "generic filter", "fast filter", "Fortran order", "invalid parameters", "edge cases", "weight dtype", "ShellSort"], "summary_hash": "6608e5e235cc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:30:51+00:00"}
