{"summary": "The module defines a set of utilities for processing service task events within a Step Functions state machine. It includes logic for evaluating task outcomes, converting failure details into ASL error representations, discovering supported parameters for various services, normalizing request payloads, and handling callbacks. Additionally, it defines a custom exception for entry count mismatches during event processing.", "business_intent": "To enable accurate simulation and handling of service task events in a mocked Step Functions environment, ensuring proper error translation, request formation, and execution flow for testing and development purposes.", "keywords": ["Step Functions", "service task", "event processing", "error handling", "request normalization", "AWS", "ASL", "failure conversion", "runtime resource", "callback", "environment", "boto client"], "summary_hash": "28d25d0bd64f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:00:36+00:00"}
