{"summary": "The module defines a set of provider interfaces used by Ansible Galaxy's dependency resolver to supply requirement information for collections. It includes a base provider that manages collection dependencies, preference handling, candidate matching, identification, and satisfaction checks, as well as version‑specific provider implementations that store a preference value and expose helpers for locating matching items. A utility function selects the appropriate provider based on the resolver library version.", "business_intent": "To enable Ansible Galaxy to resolve collection dependencies accurately across different Ansible versions by providing a flexible, version‑aware mechanism for matching requirements against available candidates and determining compatibility.", "keywords": ["dependency resolution", "provider", "collection", "requirement", "candidate", "version constraints", "preference handling", "resolver", "Ansible Galaxy", "resolvelib"], "summary_hash": "75e3db8a3a71", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:49:29+00:00"}
