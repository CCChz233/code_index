{"summary": "The module provides unit tests for MONAI's PatchDataset, generating synthetic image data, applying random spatial cropping and intensity shift transforms, wrapping the results in a PatchDataset, loading them with a DataLoader, and asserting that the extracted patches have the expected dimensions and dataset length. It also includes a trivial identity helper used within the tests.", "business_intent": "To ensure the reliability and correctness of patch extraction in medical imaging workflows, enabling reproducible model training and inference pipelines that depend on correctly sized image patches.", "keywords": ["unit test", "PatchDataset", "DataLoader", "random cropping", "intensity shift", "determinism", "synthetic data", "medical imaging", "MONAI", "numpy", "unittest"], "summary_hash": "4b4beecaebe8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:22:59+00:00"}
