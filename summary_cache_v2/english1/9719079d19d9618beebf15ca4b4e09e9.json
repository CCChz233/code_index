{"summary": "This module implements a Spectrogram Enhancer model based on a StyleGAN‑2 generative adversarial network. It provides end‑to‑end capabilities for training, inference, and auxiliary utilities such as data preparation and device management, aiming to restore fine details in low‑resolution or blurry spectrograms generated by text‑to‑speech pipelines.", "business_intent": "To boost the perceived quality and naturalness of synthetic speech by refining its spectrogram representation, enabling higher‑fidelity TTS products and services for commercial applications.", "keywords": ["spectrogram enhancement", "GAN", "StyleGAN2", "text-to-speech", "audio quality", "deep learning", "neural network", "model training", "inference", "data preparation", "device handling"], "summary_hash": "8eab33838cfa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:57:20+00:00"}
