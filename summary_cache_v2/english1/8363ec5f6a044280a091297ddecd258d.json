{"summary": "Implements a custom import hook that intercepts module loading, transforms source code to inject runtime type‑checking logic, and loads the instrumented module. It provides a manager for registering the hook, a finder that decides when to apply instrumentation, and a loader that compiles and executes the transformed code.", "business_intent": "Automatically apply Typeguard's runtime type checking to Python modules as they are imported, allowing developers to enforce type contracts without modifying source files.", "keywords": ["import hook", "runtime type checking", "module instrumentation", "AST transformation", "typeguard", "module loader", "import finder", "context manager"], "summary_hash": "cda9f97a88be", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:16:33+00:00"}
