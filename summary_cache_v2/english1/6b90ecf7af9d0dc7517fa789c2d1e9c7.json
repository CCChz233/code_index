{"summary": "The module defines a collection of neural‑network building blocks that embed squeeze‑and‑excitation (SE) channel‑attention mechanisms. It provides standard SE layers, residual SE modules, and several residual bottleneck variants (including SE‑ResNet, SE‑ResNeXt, and SENet‑style blocks) that can be combined with convolution, normalization, and activation layers to construct deep convolutional architectures.", "business_intent": "Supply reusable SE components for MONAI models, enabling developers to improve feature representation and accuracy in medical imaging deep‑learning pipelines by easily integrating channel‑wise attention and residual connections.", "keywords": ["squeeze-and-excitation", "channel attention", "residual block", "bottleneck", "SENet", "deep learning", "medical imaging", "MONAI", "feature recalibration", "convolutional neural network"], "summary_hash": "99b8445d3dd1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:22:17+00:00"}
