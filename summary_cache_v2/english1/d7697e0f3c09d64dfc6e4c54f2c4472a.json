{"summary": "The module implements a suite of dataset classes for sequence‑to‑sequence NLP tasks in the NeMo framework. It provides an abstract indexed dataset handling memory‑mapped files and concrete implementations for binarized token IDs and raw text, enabling fast random access, low‑memory loading, and seamless integration with tokenizers for large training corpora.", "business_intent": "To supply efficient, scalable data loading utilities that allow training of large‑scale seq2seq models (e.g., translation, summarization) with minimal memory footprint and high throughput.", "keywords": ["sequence-to-sequence", "dataset", "memory-mapped", "tokenization", "indexing", "PyTorch", "NeMo", "NLP", "large corpora", "fast loading"], "summary_hash": "17821f3792ad", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:27:26+00:00"}
