{"summary": "Provides scripts that define and execute long‑duration population health simulation scenarios used during model calibration. One scenario runs the full suite of disease and health‑system modules, while the other runs a synthetic population without disease or health‑system components to isolate demographic dynamics.", "business_intent": "Enable systematic calibration of the simulation model by generating reproducible, large‑scale runs that capture either the complete disease burden and health‑service usage or purely demographic behavior, supporting batch or local execution and detailed output collection.", "keywords": ["calibration", "population health simulation", "long‑run scenario", "disease modules", "health system interaction", "demographic behavior", "synthetic population", "batch execution", "logging", "output analysis"], "summary_hash": "8a5ba0e64422", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:04:53+00:00"}
