{"summary": "The module defines a flexible hook framework for PyTorch models that automatically synchronizes device placement of inputs, parameters, and buffers before forward execution, optionally offloads parameters to CPU, and allows insertion of custom pre‑ and post‑forward callbacks. It also provides utilities to attach and detach these hooks across modules and sub‑modules, supporting sequential composition and user‑friendly CPU offload management.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient memory utilization and performance optimization for large‑scale or resource‑constrained deep learning workloads by dynamically managing where model data resides and offering extensible hooks for custom execution logic.", "keywords": ["device alignment", "CPU offloading", "model hooks", "PyTorch", "memory management", "forward pass", "hook system", "tensor placement", "sequential hook", "accelerated training"], "summary_hash": "991bbaf36297", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:17:33+00:00"}
