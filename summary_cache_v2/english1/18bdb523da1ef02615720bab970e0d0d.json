{"summary": "The module implements a contrastive tension training framework for sentence embedding models, including a custom data loader that yields paired examples with occurrence counts and loss functions that compute a contrastive objective—optionally using all other batch elements as negatives—to pull semantically similar sentences together and push dissimilar ones apart.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to train more discriminative sentence transformers that achieve higher semantic similarity performance for downstream applications such as search, recommendation, and clustering.", "keywords": ["contrastive loss", "tension objective", "sentence embeddings", "in‑batch negatives", "data loader", "PyTorch", "metric learning", "semantic similarity"], "summary_hash": "24ab7d7bca27", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:52:21+00:00"}
