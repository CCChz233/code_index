{"summary": "Provides a PyTorch‑compatible dataset class that downloads the QM9 molecular collection, converts each molecule into a DGL graph with atom nodes and bond edges (using a configurable distance cutoff and optional edge functions), and supplies atomic features and a selectable set of regression targets such as dipole moment, polarizability, orbital energies, and thermodynamic properties. The class also manages caching of processed graphs.", "business_intent": "Supports development and evaluation of graph neural network models for predicting quantum‑chemical properties of small molecules, facilitating research and applications in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials design.", "keywords": ["QM9", "molecular graph", "regression", "graph neural network", "DGL", "dataset", "atomic features", "distance cutoff", "property prediction", "computational chemistry"], "summary_hash": "959e4827a651", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:16:17+00:00"}
