{"summary": "This module provides pulse-level instructions for adjusting the carrier frequency of a pulse channel. It includes an instruction to set an absolute frequency and another to apply a relative frequency shift, both performing validation and operating with zero duration.", "business_intent": "Allow quantum hardware developers to programmatically control and calibrate channel frequencies within pulse schedules, facilitating precise gate execution and hardware tuning.", "keywords": ["frequency", "pulse", "quantum control", "channel", "instruction", "set", "shift", "Qiskit", "parameter expression", "validation"], "summary_hash": "a6bccfbe362a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:04:37+00:00"}
