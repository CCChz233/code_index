{"summary": "This module supplies utilities for configuring, pruning, estimating performance, and launching tiled matrix‑multiplication kernels built with Triton. It defines a collection of kernel configurations for various data types and hardware constraints, and provides helper routines that select optimal configurations and invoke the Triton kernels for efficient GPU matmul.", "business_intent": "To accelerate transformer and other deep‑learning workloads by delivering high‑performance, low‑latency matrix‑multiplication kernels on GPUs, thereby reducing training and inference time and improving resource utilization.", "keywords": ["Triton", "tiled matrix multiplication", "GPU kernel", "performance modeling", "configuration pruning", "deep learning", "transformer optimization", "high‑performance computing", "xformers", "matmul acceleration"], "summary_hash": "9726a6e17a6f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:32:31+00:00"}
