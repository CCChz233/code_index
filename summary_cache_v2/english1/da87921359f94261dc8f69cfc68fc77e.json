{"summary": "Implements the recursive Solovay‑Kitaev algorithm that approximates an arbitrary unitary operation by a sequence of gates from a discrete universal set. It manages loading of pre‑computed elementary approximations, generates keys for lookup, and drives the recursive decomposition process used by the transpiler.", "business_intent": "Enable the quantum transpiler to compile high‑level circuits into hardware‑compatible gate sequences with provable approximation guarantees, reducing circuit depth and error while supporting scalable quantum compilation.", "keywords": ["solovay-kitaev", "gate decomposition", "quantum compilation", "recursive algorithm", "approximation", "transpiler"], "summary_hash": "de2016bec77c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:14:42+00:00"}
