{"summary": "The profiling package supplies command‑line tools that run the TLO simulation within a profiling session, gather runtime, memory, and disk I/O statistics, log execution details, and store configuration and performance results for later analysis. Shared utilities provide progress logging, checksum generation, population snapshot persistence, and scheduling of periodic profiling events.", "business_intent": "Enable systematic performance measurement and analysis of the simulation to detect bottlenecks, support scaling studies, and improve resource efficiency.", "keywords": ["profiling", "performance metrics", "runtime", "memory usage", "disk I/O", "simulation", "command-line tool", "logging", "configuration", "data aggregation", "progress tracker", "checksum", "snapshot persistence"], "summary_hash": "e3a4256568cb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:04:00+00:00"}
