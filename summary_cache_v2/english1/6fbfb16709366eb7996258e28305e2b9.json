{"summary": "The module implements the core functionality for building and running ensembles of trained 3‑D segmentation models. It manages collections of algorithms, automatically selects subsets based on validation performance (either the best model per cross‑validation fold or the top‑N models), configures an ensemble workflow, and executes inference with optional multi‑GPU support, aggregating predictions into final segmentation results.", "business_intent": "Automate the creation and execution of high‑accuracy model ensembles for medical image segmentation, reducing manual model selection and improving robustness of the Auto3Dseg inference pipeline.", "keywords": ["ensemble learning", "model selection", "cross-validation", "top‑N models", "best‑by‑fold", "medical imaging", "segmentation", "Auto3Dseg", "MONAI", "inference", "multi‑GPU", "prediction aggregation", "algorithm management"], "summary_hash": "e5067b9a22b3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:31:22+00:00"}
