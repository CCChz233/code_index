{"summary": "The test suite provides lightweight unit tests for the Wuerstchen diffusion pipelines (combined, decoder, and prior). Using mock models and inputs, it verifies essential functionalities such as callback execution, half‑precision and mixed‑precision inference, batch handling, attention slicing, model offloading, LoRA integration, and correct processing of text embedding dimensions.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the stability, performance, and correctness of the Wuerstchen pipelines before deployment, enabling rapid detection of regressions and ensuring efficient inference across different configurations.", "keywords": ["unit tests", "Wuerstchen", "diffusion pipeline", "combined pipeline", "decoder pipeline", "prior pipeline", "dummy models", "callbacks", "half-precision", "mixed-precision", "batch processing", "attention slicing", "model offloading", "LoRA", "text embeddings", "inference validation"], "summary_hash": "cd5f04656266", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:34:52+00:00"}
