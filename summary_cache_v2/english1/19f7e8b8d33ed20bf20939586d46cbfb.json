{"summary": "The package implements a complete workflow for training a Variational Graph Auto‑Encoder on citation network datasets. It includes utilities for loading and preprocessing graph data, a neural model that encodes nodes into probabilistic latent vectors using graph convolution layers, and a training script that optimizes the variational loss and evaluates link‑prediction performance with AUC and average‑precision metrics.", "business_intent": "To demonstrate how to apply unsupervised graph representation learning with a VGAE model on standard citation graphs, providing a ready‑to‑run example for researchers and developers interested in link prediction and graph embedding using PyTorch and DGL.", "keywords": ["Variational Graph Autoencoder", "VGAE", "graph neural network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "citation networks", "link prediction", "AUC", "average precision", "graph preprocessing", "latent embeddings"], "summary_hash": "fd576e3c89eb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:55:03+00:00"}
