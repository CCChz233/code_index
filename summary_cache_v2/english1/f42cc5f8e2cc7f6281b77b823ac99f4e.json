{"summary": "This module implements a synthesis routine for constructing Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) circuits that are compatible with linear nearest‑neighbor (LNN) qubit connectivity. It assembles the QFT using LNN‑friendly gate sequences, including Hadamard, controlled‑phase rotations, and CX stages provided by internal utilities.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to generate QFT circuits optimized for hardware with limited qubit connectivity, improving execution efficiency and reducing overhead on near‑term quantum devices.", "keywords": ["Quantum Fourier Transform", "QFT", "circuit synthesis", "linear nearest neighbor", "LNN", "gate decomposition", "controlled phase", "CX stage", "Qiskit", "quantum computing"], "summary_hash": "944aafe32e1b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:59:54+00:00"}
