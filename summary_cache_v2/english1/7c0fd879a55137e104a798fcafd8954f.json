It uses prior transformer to approximate image embedding from text embedding, uses frozen image encoder, text encoder, tokenizer, scheduler. So pipeline takes text prompt, encodes, runs prior diffusion to produce image embedding, maybe used later for image generation. So summary: pipeline that converts textual prompts into latent image embeddings using a diffusion prior model, integrating CLIP encoders and scheduler.
