{"summary": "The script is a reference example that shows how to fine‑tune causal language models such as GPT, GPT‑2, or CTRL on a custom text file or dataset using the Accelerate library. It parses command‑line arguments, loads a tokenizer and model, prepares and tokenizes the dataset, groups texts into blocks, sets up an optimizer and learning‑rate scheduler, runs a distributed training loop with optional evaluation, and saves checkpoints—all without relying on the HuggingFace Trainer API.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with a ready‑to‑run example for training large language models on proprietary or public text data, enabling custom text‑generation model development and experimentation in a scalable, distributed environment.", "keywords": ["fine-tuning", "causal language modeling", "GPT", "GPT-2", "CTRL", "Megatron", "Accelerate", "distributed training", "tokenization", "dataset preparation", "custom script", "text generation", "Transformers"], "summary_hash": "dbaf647f2f31", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:16:37+00:00"}
