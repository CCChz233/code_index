{"summary": "Encapsulates the logic of a foreign‑key style relationship, handling both single‑ and multi‑column links between a local model and a target model. It validates field existence and uniqueness, computes joining and reverse joining columns, supplies lookup and path information, and integrates the relationship into model classes via contribution and descriptor mechanisms.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable abstraction that lets an ORM define, validate, and operate on complex foreign‑key associations—including multi‑column keys—so that models can be linked, queries can be built, and schema migrations can be generated correctly.", "keywords": ["foreign key", "multi‑column relationship", "ORM", "join columns", "validation", "descriptor", "path info", "model integration", "schema generation", "query building"], "summary_hash": "95c223821fbf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:39:45+00:00"}
