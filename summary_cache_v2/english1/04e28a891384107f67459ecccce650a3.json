{"summary": "Base class representing JAX arrays and tracers, offering a unified interface for type checking, type annotation, and accessing array metadata such as shape, dtype, device, sharding and size. It is not intended for direct array creation, which should be done via JAX NumPy functions.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to write generic, type‑safe JAX code that works both inside and outside traced functions by providing a consistent type for arrays and exposing their properties for runtime inspection.", "keywords": ["JAX", "array", "tracer", "type annotation", "instance check", "metadata", "shape", "dtype", "device", "sharding", "size", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "bfdffc54ad5c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:30:18+00:00"}
