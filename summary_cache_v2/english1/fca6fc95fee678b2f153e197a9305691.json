{"summary": "These modules implement Feast's Data Quality Monitoring profiling layer. The core module defines abstract profiling and validation constructs, including a profile entity that can be serialized to protobuf, utilities for extracting metadata from pandas feature tables, and lightweight containers for validation errors and overall results. The Great Expectations integration module builds on these abstractions to apply ExpectationSuites to feature datasets, produce validation reports, and serialize the outcomes using Feast protobuf messages.", "business_intent": "Provide an automated, standardized way to assess and monitor the quality of feature data in Feast pipelines, leveraging Great Expectations for expressive expectations and protobuf for interoperable result exchange.", "keywords": ["Feast", "Data Quality Monitoring", "Great Expectations", "profiling", "validation", "protobuf", "pandas", "feature store", "expectation suites"], "summary_hash": "7d223b167784", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:37:35+00:00"}
