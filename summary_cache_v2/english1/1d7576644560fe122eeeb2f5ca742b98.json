{"summary": "Provides a wrapper class that loads a torchvision classification model and modifies its final classification head. The wrapper can either replace the last fully‑connected layer or remove the existing pooling and head, inserting a new pooling layer followed by a configurable fully‑connected or convolutional layer, with optional pretrained weights.", "business_intent": "Enables easy adaptation of pretrained torchvision models for custom classification tasks in the MONAI framework, supporting transfer learning and flexible head customization for medical imaging applications.", "keywords": ["torchvision", "model adaptation", "classification head", "fully connected layer", "pooling layer", "pretrained weights", "transfer learning", "MONAI", "NetAdapter", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "cb9331cf707e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:19:32+00:00"}
