{"summary": "The Lightning Fabric package offers a high‑level, hardware‑agnostic interface for PyTorch models, handling automatic device placement, precision selection, and distributed execution. It includes a command‑line tool that parses arguments, configures accelerators, strategies, and precision plugins, and launches user scripts (including multi‑process torchrun). A connector resolves configuration from arguments and environment variables, validates compatibility, and constructs the appropriate training strategy. Core APIs move models and data to the right devices and orchestrate execution across CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs. Lightweight wrappers adapt data loaders, modules, and optimizers for seamless integration, managing state serialization and optional TorchDynamo compilation.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with a simple yet powerful way to scale PyTorch training and inference across diverse hardware setups, reducing engineering effort, improving productivity, and accelerating AI product development and deployment.", "keywords": ["Lightning Fabric", "PyTorch", "distributed training", "accelerator", "strategy", "precision", "CLI", "device placement", "GPU", "TPU", "CPU", "torchrun", "wrapper", "data loader", "optimizer", "state serialization", "TorchDynamo"], "summary_hash": "d350e44f2874", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:12:55+00:00"}
