{"summary": "Implements a SparseControlNet architecture that injects sparse conditioning signals into a text-to-video diffusion model. It configures down/up blocks, cross‑attention, transformer layers, time embeddings, and a motion module, while supporting gradient checkpointing and flexible attention processing.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to add precise, sparse control (e.g., motion cues, masks) to video diffusion pipelines, improving controllability and quality of generated video content for creative and media applications.", "keywords": ["sparse control", "diffusion model", "video generation", "controlnet", "cross-attention", "transformer layers", "time embedding", "motion module", "gradient checkpointing", "attention slicing", "conditioning embedding"], "summary_hash": "b4fcf8a35a3e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:40:13+00:00"}
