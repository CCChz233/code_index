{"summary": "The module establishes an abstract foundation for language model interactions and provides concrete adapters that normalize different Langchain and LlamaIndex LLM implementations. It manages model configuration (e.g., temperature, run settings), offers both synchronous and asynchronous text generation utilities, and includes mechanisms to verify completion status and handle retries.", "business_intent": "To give the RAG evaluation framework a unified, configurable way to call various LLM services, simplifying integration, execution control, and error handling across multiple providers.", "keywords": ["language model abstraction", "LLM wrapper", "retrieval-augmented generation", "synchronous generation", "asynchronous generation", "configuration management", "run settings", "multiple completion support", "error handling", "retry logic", "Langchain integration", "LlamaIndex integration"], "summary_hash": "8c05ddd886f1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:52:37+00:00"}
