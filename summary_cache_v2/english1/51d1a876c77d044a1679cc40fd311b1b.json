{"summary": "A dataset class that loads the QM9 molecular graph collection, representing each molecule as a graph with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. It supplies atomic features (coordinates, atomic numbers) and a configurable set of regression targets such as dipole moment, polarizability, orbital energies, and thermodynamic quantities. The class handles downloading, caching, graph construction with a distance cutoff, optional custom edge functions, and provides the number of available labels.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and engineers to quickly integrate the QM9 quantum‑chemical dataset into graph‑based machine‑learning pipelines for property prediction, facilitating model development, benchmarking, and scientific discovery without manual data preprocessing.", "keywords": ["QM9", "molecular graph", "regression targets", "quantum chemistry", "graph neural network", "DGL", "dataset loading", "atomic features", "edge functions", "distance cutoff", "property prediction"], "summary_hash": "ea65fe06f6df", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:11:11+00:00"}
