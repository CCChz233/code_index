{"summary": "This module defines a sparse matrix abstraction for the Deep Graph Library, offering a class that encapsulates matrix dimensions, non‑zero entries, and basic manipulation utilities. It also includes helper routines for constructing sparse matrices from common formats (COO, CSR, CSC) and for formatting representations.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient storage and handling of large, sparse adjacency or feature matrices within DGL, facilitating graph‑related computations that benefit from sparse data structures.", "keywords": ["sparse matrix", "DGL", "graph neural networks", "COO format", "CSR format", "CSC format", "PyTorch", "tensor", "matrix representation", "utility functions"], "summary_hash": "38ad3bcf6bd6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:37:39+00:00"}
