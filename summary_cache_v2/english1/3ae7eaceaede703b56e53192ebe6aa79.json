{"summary": "The module defines a suite of immutable, async‑compatible context objects that encapsulate all runtime information required during Prefect flow and task execution. These models expose flow metadata, task runner details, client connections, result handling, state tracking, configuration profiles, tag collections, and a registry for created Prefect objects, while guaranteeing thread safety and preventing direct mutation.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable, thread‑safe mechanism for accessing and managing execution metadata, configuration settings, and auxiliary resources throughout a Prefect workflow, enabling consistent behavior, safe concurrency, and clear separation between user code and internal runtime state.", "keywords": ["context", "immutable", "thread‑safe", "runtime", "Prefect", "flow execution", "task execution", "settings profile", "tags", "object registry", "engine", "state management", "result handling", "API client", "synchronization"], "summary_hash": "da07b430387d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:24:05+00:00"}
