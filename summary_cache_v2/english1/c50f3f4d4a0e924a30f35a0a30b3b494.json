{"summary": "Utility module that implements masking operations on MODFLOW‑6 model datasets. It provides functions to adjust masks for variables without layer dimensions, apply masks across all models, packages and spatial variables, and selectively skip variables or data arrays. The masking respects model and simulation settings, grid domain compatibility, and handles transient auxiliary variables, returning masked xarray structures suitable for downstream analysis.", "business_intent": "Enable automated filtering of model output and input data to retain only relevant cells and variables according to simulation masking settings, improving data quality and reducing storage/processing overhead for groundwater modeling workflows.", "keywords": ["masking", "MODFLOW 6", "xarray", "grid", "spatial dimensions", "auxiliary variables", "simulation settings", "data preprocessing", "hydrogeology", "model output"], "summary_hash": "37f20cdb4f8e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:01:32+00:00"}
