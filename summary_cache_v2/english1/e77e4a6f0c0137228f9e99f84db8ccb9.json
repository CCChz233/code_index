{"summary": "The package contains three example modules that illustrate how early binding with Cython can speed up simple geometric calculations. One module provides a pure‑Python rectangle class with an area method, while the other two show Cython implementations using cdef and cpdef classes to achieve faster area computation, each accompanied by a lightweight helper routine.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate to developers how to use Cython's early‑binding features (cdef/cpdef) to accelerate numeric code, offering a clear performance comparison between pure Python and compiled Cython for basic shape operations.", "keywords": ["rectangle", "area calculation", "Cython", "cdef", "cpdef", "early binding", "performance optimization", "speed", "example code", "user guide"], "summary_hash": "fef02b04191c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:31:11+00:00"}
