{"summary": "A decoder orchestrator that runs auto‑regressive RNN‑Transducer decoding using a provided encoder state, decoder, joint network and tokenizer. It supports multiple strategies (greedy, beam, TSD, ALSD) and can optionally generate token sequences, alignments, timestamps, language IDs and various confidence scores based on a rich configuration.", "business_intent": "Enable configurable, high‑performance speech‑to‑text inference for RNN‑T models, delivering not only transcriptions but also detailed metadata (timings, language tags, confidence metrics) required for downstream applications such as real‑time transcription services, analytics, and multilingual voice assistants.", "keywords": ["RNN-T", "decoding", "beam search", "greedy decoding", "timestamps", "confidence scores", "alignments", "language identification", "tokenizer", "speech recognition", "inference"], "summary_hash": "1feb27086c47", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:32:33+00:00"}
