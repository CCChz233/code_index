{"summary": "Implements a learning‑based registration framework that concatenates moving and fixed images, predicts a spatial transformation using a configurable encoder‑decoder backbone, optionally integrates a stationary velocity field into a diffeomorphic displacement via scaling‑and‑squaring, and warps the moving image to align with the fixed image.", "business_intent": "Offer an out‑of‑the‑box deep learning solution for medical image registration, enabling automated alignment of volumetric scans for longitudinal studies, multimodal fusion, and treatment planning within the MONAI ecosystem.", "keywords": ["image registration", "deep learning", "stationary velocity field", "diffeomorphic transformation", "scaling and squaring", "encoder‑decoder backbone", "warping", "medical imaging", "MONAI", "neural network"], "summary_hash": "873b5b4da741", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:29:58+00:00"}
