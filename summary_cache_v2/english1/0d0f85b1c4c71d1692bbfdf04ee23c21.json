{"summary": "Implements a quantum ripple‑carry adder circuit that performs in‑place addition of two quantum registers. Depending on the selected mode it constructs a full, half, or fixed‑size adder using MAJ and UMA gates, managing carry bits and optional helper qubits.", "business_intent": "Supply a reusable quantum‑circuit building block for arithmetic addition, supporting various adder configurations to facilitate reversible and efficient sum operations in quantum algorithms.", "keywords": ["quantum ripple-carry adder", "in-place addition", "qubit registers", "MAJ gate", "UMA gate", "full adder", "half adder", "fixed-size adder", "quantum circuit", "quantum arithmetic"], "summary_hash": "1704349c1292", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:38:06+00:00"}
