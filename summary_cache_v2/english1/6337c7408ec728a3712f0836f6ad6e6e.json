{"summary": "The module defines a set of asymmetric loss functions that combine focal weighting with the Tversky index for binary image segmentation. These losses give extra emphasis to the foreground class, helping to mitigate severe class imbalance typical in medical imaging tasks.", "business_intent": "Provide robust loss utilities for training deep learning models in medical image segmentation, improving accuracy on under‑represented structures by addressing class imbalance.", "keywords": ["loss function", "asymmetric focal loss", "Tversky index", "binary segmentation", "class imbalance", "medical imaging", "deep learning", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "b7423a7153e1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:15:26+00:00"}
