{"summary": "The module provides a suite of unit tests for the local attention mechanism used in automatic speech recognition models. It verifies that attention parameters can be modified, the forward pass produces expected outputs, and training proceeds correctly using a minimal deterministic dataset. A helper function assists with attribute retrieval.", "business_intent": "Validate and ensure the reliability of the local attention component within ASR systems, supporting stable model training and inference in production speech recognition pipelines.", "keywords": ["ASR", "local attention", "unit test", "PyTorch Lightning", "dummy dataset", "parameter modification", "forward computation", "training dynamics", "speech recognition", "model validation"], "summary_hash": "2e5e33bac8b9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:28:33+00:00"}
