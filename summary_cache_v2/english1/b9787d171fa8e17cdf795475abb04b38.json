{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that converts textual prompts into images using the Stable Diffusion XL model, optionally enriched with one or more T2I adapters that supply extra conditioning signals. Manages prompt tokenization, latent preparation, denoising with a conditional UNet and scheduler, VAE decoding, safety checking, and supports loading of LoRA, IP‑Adapter and textual‑inversion weights.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to easily generate high‑quality, controllable images from text while allowing fine‑grained conditioning and safety, suitable for creative tools, content generation platforms, and research prototypes.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "stable diffusion", "adapter", "T2I", "diffusion pipeline", "latent diffusion", "safety checker", "LoRA", "IP adapter", "prompt encoding", "image generation", "conditional UNet", "scheduler", "VAE", "CLIP", "multi-adapter"], "summary_hash": "7dfd8c65bb95", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:19:40+00:00"}
