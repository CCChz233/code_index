{"summary": "The module provides a suite of unit tests that verify how a simulated 7‑qubit quantum backend reports and manages deliberately faulty gates, faulty qubits, and missing qubit properties. It checks operational flags, property retrieval, and conversion utilities to ensure the backend’s property interface behaves correctly under error conditions.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard quantum software by detecting and handling erroneous hardware characteristics in simulated backends, enabling robust debugging, quality assurance, and reliable integration of quantum devices.", "keywords": ["quantum backend", "faulty gate", "faulty qubit", "missing property", "unit testing", "Qiskit", "property interface", "operational status", "simulation", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "8fda1ece9d79", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:52:07+00:00"}
