{"summary": "Provides an attention mechanism that derives a probability distribution over sequence positions by feeding each key vector into a multilayer perceptron, applying an optional mask to ignore invalid entries, and normalizing the resulting scalars with softmax. No separate query vector is required.", "business_intent": "Allows sequence‑to‑sequence models, such as encoder‑decoder architectures for machine translation or other NLP tasks, to weight input elements based solely on their key representations, improving focus on relevant information without needing a query.", "keywords": ["attention", "MLP", "keys only", "softmax", "mask", "Bahdanau", "sequence modeling", "neural machine translation"], "summary_hash": "456567c665fb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:53:57+00:00"}
