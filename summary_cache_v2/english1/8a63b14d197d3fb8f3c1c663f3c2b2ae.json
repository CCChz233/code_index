{"summary": "This module provides a comprehensive test suite for the tensor (Kronecker) composition functionality of quantum circuits. It checks that tensoring circuits yields results consistent with quantum information theory, correctly handles measurements on all qubits, supports circuits with mixed or multiple registers, and works for both named and unnamed tensor operations.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and robustness of the circuit tensor operation in the quantum computing framework, ensuring accurate mathematical behavior, proper measurement handling, and compatibility with diverse circuit configurations.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "tensor product", "composition", "unit testing", "Qiskit", "measurement", "multi‑register", "named tensor", "unnamed tensor", "circuit error", "operator equivalence"], "summary_hash": "ae3ad16f93c3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:42:31+00:00"}
