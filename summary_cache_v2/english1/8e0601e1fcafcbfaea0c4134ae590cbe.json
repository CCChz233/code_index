{"summary": "The module implements an Euler‑based integration scheduler tailored for the Elucidated Diffusion Model (EDM) framework. It computes the sigma schedule, adds appropriate noise, applies input and output preconditioning, and advances the diffusion step to guide the denoising trajectory of latent variables during sampling. An accompanying output container encapsulates the results of each step.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient and stable sampling for diffusion‑based generative AI systems by providing a ready‑to‑use Euler scheduler that integrates with the EDM diffusion pipeline, thereby accelerating model deployment and improving generated content quality.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "Euler scheduler", "EDM", "sigma schedule", "denoising", "latent sampling", "preconditioning", "PyTorch", "generative models", "sampling algorithm"], "summary_hash": "8a0d79fad6d9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:14:33+00:00"}
