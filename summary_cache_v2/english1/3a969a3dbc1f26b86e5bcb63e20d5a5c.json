{"summary": "The module offers utilities to load and benchmark Kedro configuration data for the TimeOmega system. It defines loader classes that manage initialization, cleanup, and retrieval of catalog, global settings, parameters, and runtime parameters, with one variant measuring the time taken for catalog and parameter loading. Supporting helper functions create temporary configuration files and generate catalog, globals, and parameters structures.", "business_intent": "Enable performance testing and optimization of Kedro's configuration loading process, specifically for TimeOmega configurations, by providing tools to measure and analyze loading times and ensure proper setup and teardown of configuration resources.", "keywords": ["kedro", "configuration loading", "OmegaConfigLoader", "benchmarking", "performance measurement", "catalog", "parameters", "initialization", "cleanup", "TimeOmega", "soft strategies"], "summary_hash": "ac6b8ba3154c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:16:08+00:00"}
