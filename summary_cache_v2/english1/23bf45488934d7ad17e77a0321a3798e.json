{"summary": "The analyzer package supplies a pluggable framework for preprocessing text in the Annif indexing system. It maintains a registry of language‑specific analyzer classes, selects the appropriate analyzer based on language or configuration, and defines shared utilities for token validation, sentence splitting, and word handling. Concrete implementations provide simple lower‑casing, lemmatization via Simplemma, stemming via NLTK Snowball, tokenization and lemmatization via spaCy, and Finnish processing via libvoikko.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate and language‑aware text preprocessing so that Annif can generate reliable subject suggestions and index documents effectively across multiple languages.", "keywords": ["text preprocessing", "tokenization", "lemmatization", "stemming", "language-specific analysis", "Annif", "registry", "simple analyzer", "Snowball", "spaCy", "Simplemma", "Voikko"], "summary_hash": "f4d26edf4315", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:36:57+00:00"}
