{"summary": "This module defines a suite of automated tests that verify the correctness and robustness of the plasma frequency calculation utilities. The tests cover numerical results, unit conversion, handling of scalar and array inputs, propagation of NaN values, appropriate warnings and error raising, and the proper delegation to a lightweight, JIT‑compiled implementation.", "business_intent": "Provide comprehensive validation of plasma frequency functions to guarantee accurate scientific calculations and maintain code reliability within the library.", "keywords": ["plasma frequency", "unit testing", "validation", "numerical accuracy", "unit conversion", "array support", "NaN handling", "warnings", "error handling", "lightweight implementation", "JIT compilation", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "d596ff0cb7a8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:08:09+00:00"}
