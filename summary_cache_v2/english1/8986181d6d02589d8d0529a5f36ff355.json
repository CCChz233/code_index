{"summary": "Implements a high‑performance DALI pipeline that reads audio files and their character‑level transcripts from manifest files, optionally filters by duration, trims silence, normalizes text, extracts acoustic features (e.g., mel‑spectrogram or MFCC), maps characters to sub‑word IDs with optional BOS/EOS tokens, pads sequences, and yields batched tensors for training or inference on CPU or GPU.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, scalable feeding of speech‑recognition models that use character‑based targets by reducing I/O and preprocessing bottlenecks through GPU‑accelerated data loading and feature extraction.", "keywords": ["audio loading", "character transcription", "NVIDIA DALI", "manifest files", "batching", "resampling", "silence trimming", "text normalization", "mel spectrogram", "MFCC", "padding", "GPU acceleration", "CPU preprocessing", "distributed training", "speech recognition"], "summary_hash": "6950e090c9c3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:09:00+00:00"}
