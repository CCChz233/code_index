{"summary": "A collection of utilities that prepare NeMo neural modules for export to production‑ready formats such as ONNX and TorchScript. It defines compatible custom layers, performs graph transformations (e.g., replacing fused layers, inserting casts), wraps forward methods, scripts modules, and offers verification helpers.", "business_intent": "Facilitate reliable model serialization and deployment by converting research‑grade NeMo models into optimized, runtime‑compatible representations for inference engines.", "keywords": ["model export", "ONNX", "TorchScript", "layer replacement", "casting", "RMSNorm", "linear with bias skip", "NeMo", "deployment", "inference"], "summary_hash": "411af5ba42f9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:48:09+00:00"}
