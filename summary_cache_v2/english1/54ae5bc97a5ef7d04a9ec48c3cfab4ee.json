{"summary": "A test suite that validates the behavior of retrieving flow runs from a work queue, checking that filtering by deployment identifiers and tags works, that concurrency limits are honored (including zero limits), that scheduled runs are correctly returned, and that appropriate errors are raised when the queue is not found. It also confirms that multiple filter criteria are combined using a union logic.", "business_intent": "Guarantee reliable and correct operation of the work‑queue run‑fetching functionality, ensuring it respects filters, concurrency settings, and error conditions so that downstream scheduling and execution components function as expected.", "keywords": ["testing", "work queue", "flow runs", "filtering", "deployment IDs", "tags", "concurrency limit", "scheduled runs", "error handling", "union filter", "unit tests", "API validation"], "summary_hash": "3943444e48b4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:21:36+00:00"}
