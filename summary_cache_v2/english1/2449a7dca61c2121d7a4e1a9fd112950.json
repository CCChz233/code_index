{"summary": "A diffusion‑based pipeline that performs image inpainting by combining a Flux transformer, a scheduler, a variational auto‑encoder, and dual text encoders. It encodes input images and masks into latent space, generates prompt embeddings, runs the denoising process conditioned on the mask and textual description, and decodes the result back to an edited image.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use solution for developers and content creators to automatically fill or modify missing regions in images according to natural‑language instructions, supporting applications such as visual content creation, photo restoration, and creative editing.", "keywords": ["inpainting", "diffusion", "controlnet", "flux", "transformer", "scheduler", "VAE", "text-to-image", "latent encoding", "mask processing", "prompt embedding", "image generation"], "summary_hash": "8f9f108a0b99", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:14:27+00:00"}
