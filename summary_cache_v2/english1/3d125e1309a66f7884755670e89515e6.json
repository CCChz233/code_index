{"summary": "Compose builds a sequential pipeline of callables that process data items, supporting both single-array/tensor inputs and dictionary-based inputs with pass‑through semantics. It can automatically apply each transform to every element of a list, optionally unpack arguments, log execution, enforce deterministic randomness, and optionally perform lazy resampling to minimise repeated spatial operations. Overrides allow runtime parameter injection for compatible transforms.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, reproducible and performance‑aware way to compose preprocessing and augmentation steps for medical imaging (or similar) data, simplifying pipeline definition and execution while supporting deterministic behavior and lazy resampling.", "keywords": ["pipeline", "sequential transforms", "dictionary handling", "map_items", "lazy resampling", "overrides", "deterministic", "logging", "medical imaging", "preprocessing", "augmentation"], "summary_hash": "39832178682f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:05:48+00:00"}
