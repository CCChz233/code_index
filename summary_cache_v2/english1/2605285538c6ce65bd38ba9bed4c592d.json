{"summary": "The core package implements a comprehensive Python interface to ANSYS Mechanical APDL (MAPDL). It manages MAPDL sessions (local, remote, gRPC, in‑process), builds and dispatches commands, handles licensing, geometry creation, mesh streaming, parameter synchronization, solution extraction, post‑processing, and reporting, while providing utilities for error handling, threading, and component management.", "business_intent": "To empower engineers and developers to automate, script, and integrate ANSYS MAPDL simulations within Python workflows, enabling scalable analysis, remote execution, and seamless data exchange for design optimization and engineering decision‑making.", "keywords": ["ANSYS MAPDL", "Python API", "finite element analysis", "simulation automation", "session management", "command execution", "geometry modeling", "mesh handling", "post‑processing", "licensing", "gRPC", "HPC", "parameter management", "Krylov solver", "reporting"], "summary_hash": "88eb7b06bd56", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:06:16+00:00"}
