{"summary": "Provides a suite of unit tests that verify the functionality of the plasma blob model, including its composition handling, coupling calculations, electron density and temperature properties, ionization processes, quantum theta evaluation, and proper error handling for invalid particle specifications. It also tests the classification logic for different plasma regimes based on coupling strength and the balance between Fermi quantum and thermal kinetic energies, and includes auxiliary checks for magnetostatic integration and derived variables in a three‑dimensional plasma representation.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the scientific accuracy and reliability of the plasma blob implementation by automatically detecting regressions or incorrect physical computations, thereby supporting robust plasma modeling in research applications.", "keywords": ["plasma blob", "unit testing", "coupling strength", "electron density", "temperature", "ionization", "quantum theta", "invalid particle handling", "plasma regimes", "Fermi quantum energy", "thermal kinetic energy", "magnetostatics", "derived variables", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "ed000eec5ba8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:07:33+00:00"}
