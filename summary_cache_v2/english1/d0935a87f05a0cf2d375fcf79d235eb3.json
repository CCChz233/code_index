{"summary": "The module implements utilities for extracting container image references from Kubernetes manifests within the Checkov static analysis framework. It provides a base provider class with helper methods to locate manifest files, navigate their structure, and retrieve image specifications along with source location metadata. A manager class orchestrates the extraction process and integrates the results with a generic graph‑based image referencer system for further analysis.", "business_intent": "Support security and compliance scanning of Kubernetes configurations by identifying the container images used, enabling downstream vulnerability assessment, policy enforcement, and graph‑based dependency analysis.", "keywords": ["Kubernetes", "container images", "image extraction", "static analysis", "Checkov", "graph-based analysis", "manifest parsing", "security scanning", "compliance"], "summary_hash": "10827fe7029b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:13:24+00:00"}
