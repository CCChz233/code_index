{"summary": "A command‑line utility that runs a short training benchmark for a Hugging Face sequence‑classification model using the Accelerate library. It loads a dataset, tokenizes it, builds data loaders, sets up an optimizer and learning‑rate scheduler, executes a training loop under the selected distributed strategy (e.g., DeepSpeed, FSDP), measures throughput and timing, and writes the performance metrics to a JSON file.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to quickly assess the training speed and scaling behavior of models on different hardware and accelerator configurations, facilitating performance comparison and hardware selection decisions.", "keywords": ["accelerate", "performance benchmark", "training speed", "distributed training", "deep speed", "fsdp", "transformers", "tokenization", "dataloader", "optimizer", "learning rate scheduler", "throughput", "json output"], "summary_hash": "1d33d35e6deb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:20:21+00:00"}
