{"summary": "The module implements a command‑line benchmark that measures the execution time of a trivial (no‑operation) workload using both the Arkouda distributed array library and NumPy. It parses user options, validates results, and reports timing for each backend.", "business_intent": "Provide a simple performance comparison between a distributed array system and a local NumPy implementation to assess overhead and scalability of the Arkouda platform.", "keywords": ["benchmark", "Arkouda", "NumPy", "performance", "timing", "no‑op", "command‑line", "parser", "correctness"], "summary_hash": "585d8be0de19", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:18:06+00:00"}
