{"summary": "The module defines a configurable pooling encoder that reduces token-level transformer outputs into a single representation using various pooling strategies. It constructs the required sub‑modules, aligns hidden dimensions, and integrates with the NeMo transformer encoder framework.", "business_intent": "Offer a reusable, flexible component for aggregating transformer hidden states, enabling downstream NLP models to obtain compact sentence or document embeddings for tasks such as classification, retrieval, or similarity.", "keywords": ["transformer", "encoder", "pooling", "reduction", "aggregation", "hidden size", "PyTorch", "NeMo", "NLP", "representation"], "summary_hash": "aef27c183750", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:23:03+00:00"}
