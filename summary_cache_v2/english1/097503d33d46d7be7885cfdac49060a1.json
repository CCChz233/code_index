{"summary": "The module defines a compact, multi‑dimensional container for measurement bits used in Qiskit primitives. It offers efficient storage, logical operations, reshaping, and utilities to convert the stored bits into bitstrings, integer values, and frequency counts, leveraging NumPy for performance.", "business_intent": "Enable fast and memory‑efficient handling of quantum measurement results, facilitating downstream analysis such as result aggregation, histogram generation, and post‑processing in quantum computing workflows.", "keywords": ["measurement bits", "multi-dimensional array", "compact storage", "logical operations", "reshaping", "bitstring conversion", "integer representation", "frequency counts", "Qiskit primitives", "result processing", "NumPy", "Counts"], "summary_hash": "2f85fec82e4d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:22:43+00:00"}
