{"summary": "DeviceMesh encapsulates a collection of computation devices arranged in a multi‑dimensional mesh, storing the mesh shape, logical axis identifiers, and the underlying device list. It provides convenient accessors and readable representations, enabling the definition of data‑parallel and model‑parallel topologies for distributed execution.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to define and manage hardware topologies for parallel machine‑learning workloads, simplifying the distribution of tensors and variables across multiple devices.", "keywords": ["distributed computation", "device mesh", "parallel training", "mesh shape", "axis names", "hardware topology", "tensor layout"], "summary_hash": "595fac0ba203", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:28:38+00:00"}
