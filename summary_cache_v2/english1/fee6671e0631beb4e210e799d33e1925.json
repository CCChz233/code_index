{"summary": "Implements a dataset that streams audio recordings stored in tar archives using a JSON manifest. It filters files by duration, optionally trims silence, normalizes audio, and can slice or window the signal for speaker recognition or VAD. The class handles sharding, configurable shuffle buffers, and two shard distribution strategies to support multi‑process or distributed training with WebDataset.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient, scalable loading of large tarred speech corpora for training deep learning models (ASR, speaker ID, VAD) in single‑ or multi‑node environments.", "keywords": ["tarred audio", "dataset", "manifest", "speech recognition", "speaker identification", "voice activity detection", "sharding", "distributed training", "WebDataset", "duration filtering", "audio normalization", "silence trimming", "windowing", "shuffle buffer"], "summary_hash": "04292147e168", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:17:44+00:00"}
