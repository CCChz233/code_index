{"summary": "Implements a text‑to‑image generation pipeline built on the Flux diffusion model. It orchestrates a conditional transformer, a scheduler, a variational auto‑encoder, and dual text encoders (CLIP and T5) with their tokenizers to turn textual prompts into latent representations, perform denoising steps, and decode the latents into images. The pipeline also handles prompt embedding, latent packing/unpacking, guidance scaling, and interruption control.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use AI service that creates high‑quality images from natural language prompts, supporting creative, marketing, design, and product visualization applications for developers and enterprises.", "keywords": ["text-to-image", "diffusion model", "Flux", "conditional transformer", "scheduler", "variational auto‑encoder", "VAE", "CLIP encoder", "T5 encoder", "prompt embedding", "latent representation", "guidance scaling", "image synthesis", "AI generation"], "summary_hash": "e2f0bee079e6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:14:22+00:00"}
