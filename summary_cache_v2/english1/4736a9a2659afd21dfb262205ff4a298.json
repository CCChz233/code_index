{"summary": "The module provides a runner that executes each experiment stage in a separate operating‑system process, abstracting the location of execution (local or remote). It manages process creation, monitoring, and result collection, allowing callers to remain independent of the underlying execution environment.", "business_intent": "Facilitate scalable, isolated, and potentially distributed execution of machine‑learning experiment stages to improve resource utilization, fault isolation, and flexibility in deployment environments.", "keywords": ["experiment runner", "out-of-process execution", "process management", "remote execution", "stage orchestration", "result collection", "isolation", "scalability"], "summary_hash": "de8b1a7baeb3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:03:58+00:00"}
