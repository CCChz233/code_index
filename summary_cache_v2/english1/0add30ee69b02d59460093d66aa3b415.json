{"summary": "The module defines a graph neural network architecture built on PyTorch and DGL, featuring a graph convolutional component for processing node features, a configurable stack of hidden layers with activation functions to generate low‑dimensional node embeddings, and a simple multi‑layer perceptron used as a projection head. It also includes utilities to compute similarity scores between embeddings and a contrastive training loss.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to train and deploy graph‑based representation models for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, recommendation, or any application requiring learned embeddings of graph-structured data, leveraging contrastive learning for improved performance.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "GCN", "PyTorch", "DGL", "node embeddings", "contrastive learning", "representation learning", "MLP", "similarity scoring", "training loss"], "summary_hash": "7ce86ce082c4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:15:43+00:00"}
