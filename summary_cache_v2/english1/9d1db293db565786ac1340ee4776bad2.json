{"summary": "A collection of helper utilities that facilitate text generation for NeMo models, offering functions for beam‑search length penalties, various token sampling strategies (greedy, top‑k, etc.), repetition penalties, default length and sampling configurations, batch extraction, and model‑parallel coordination. The module also includes specialized generation pathways for Megatron‑GPT and multimodal NEVA models, as well as utilities for processing logits and synchronizing generation across distributed setups.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, configurable foundation for generating natural language (and multimodal) outputs from large language models within the NeMo ecosystem, supporting diverse decoding methods, parallel execution, and integration with downstream inference pipelines.", "keywords": ["text generation", "sampling", "beam search", "length penalty", "repetition penalty", "token logits", "model parallel", "Megatron", "NEVA", "default parameters", "batch handling"], "summary_hash": "bd082c9732dc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:21:20+00:00"}
