{"summary": "The module defines immutable data models that describe the static properties and capabilities of quantum backends. It provides a backward‑compatible abstract configuration class, concrete containers for OpenQASM and OpenPulse backends, a gate definition structure, and a representation of U‑channel local oscillators, all supporting serialization and validation.", "business_intent": "To give quantum hardware providers and users a reliable, version‑stable way to specify backend characteristics—such as qubit count, supported gates, pulse channel topology, timing parameters, and oscillator settings—so that software can validate, schedule, and execute quantum circuits and pulse programs consistently across different backends.", "keywords": ["backend configuration", "quantum computing", "Qiskit", "OpenQASM", "OpenPulse", "gate definition", "pulse channels", "local oscillator", "immutable model", "serialization", "compatibility shim"], "summary_hash": "8644d4d0311d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:33:14+00:00"}
