{"summary": "Implements a channel selection mechanism that chooses the reference channel yielding the highest signal‑to‑noise ratio. Depending on configuration it outputs either a hard one‑hot selection or a soft probability distribution across channels, and supports gradient estimation via a straight‑through estimator for hard selections.", "business_intent": "Enhance audio or speech processing pipelines by automatically identifying the most reliable reference channel, thereby improving downstream tasks such as noise reduction, beamforming, or speech recognition.", "keywords": ["reference channel selection", "SNR maximization", "hard/soft estimation", "straight‑through gradient", "subband weighting", "one‑hot encoding", "soft reference vector", "audio signal processing", "speech enhancement"], "summary_hash": "692e1708b3de", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:29:15+00:00"}
