{"summary": "A test module that simulates random pregnancies and births within a population. Each month a fixed‑probability event may turn non‑pregnant individuals into pregnant ones, and nine months later a birth event creates a new individual. The module defines the necessary events and a disease‑like component to drive this behavior.", "business_intent": "Provide a lightweight, deterministic example for validating the simulation framework’s event scheduling, population updates, and parameter handling by modeling stochastic births without realistic constraints.", "keywords": ["random pregnancy", "birth simulation", "event scheduling", "population dynamics", "test module", "probability", "regular event", "delayed event", "demographic modeling"], "summary_hash": "0acdf4f83783", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:52:06+00:00"}
