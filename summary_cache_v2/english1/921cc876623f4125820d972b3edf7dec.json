{"summary": "This module implements a BERT‑based neural model that evaluates an automatic speech recognition (ASR) hypothesis against a set of possible domain‑specific correction candidates and predicts which candidate, if any, matches the hypothesis. It encapsulates data handling, loss computation, training, and inference logic to provide spellchecking and customization capabilities for speech transcription outputs.", "business_intent": "Enhance the quality of speech‑to‑text systems by automatically correcting transcription errors using domain‑specific vocabularies, thereby improving user experience in voice‑driven applications such as virtual assistants, call‑center analytics, and transcription services.", "keywords": ["BERT", "ASR", "spellchecking", "domain customization", "candidate ranking", "speech transcription correction", "NLP", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "neural classification"], "summary_hash": "fd464ec21dc7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:33:48+00:00"}
