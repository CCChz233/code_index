{"summary": "Implements a pipeline that converts textual prompts into high‑fidelity audio by encoding text with a frozen CLAP model, preparing latent audio representations, iteratively denoising them with a conditional UNet guided by a scheduler, decoding the latents to mel‑spectrograms via a VAE, and finally synthesizing waveforms using a vocoder.", "business_intent": "Provides a ready‑to‑use solution for developers and content creators to generate realistic audio from text, supporting applications such as media production, game sound design, advertising, and AI‑driven audio content creation.", "keywords": ["text-to-audio", "latent diffusion", "CLAP encoder", "conditional UNet", "scheduler", "VAE decoder", "vocoder", "mel-spectrogram", "audio synthesis", "AI audio generation"], "summary_hash": "8753676c6269", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:41:40+00:00"}
