{"summary": "The module implements a collection of custom Jinja2 extensions and a specialized loader that augment CKAN's templating system. These extensions introduce tags for embedding asset bundles, extending templates from deeper directories, sanitizing translated HTML, generating navigation links, rendering reusable snippets, constructing URLs, and resolving static asset URLs. The loader restricts template searches to the CKAN template hierarchy when using the custom extend tag. Helper utilities expose configuration options and manage extension registration.", "business_intent": "To enhance CKAN's web interface by providing developers with high‑level, reusable template tags that simplify asset management, template inheritance, internationalization, navigation, and URL generation, while ensuring consistent template resolution and security across the platform.", "keywords": ["jinja2", "extension", "template", "asset", "url", "static", "i18n", "snippet", "loader", "ckan", "web assets", "translation", "navigation"], "summary_hash": "50f506551406", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T19:28:42+00:00"}
