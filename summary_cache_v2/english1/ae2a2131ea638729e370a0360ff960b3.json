{"summary": "Implements an abstract decoder interface and a concrete beam‑search decoder for Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) outputs. The decoder transforms log‑probability tensors into textual hypotheses, handling blank tokens, configurable beam width, tokenizers, alignment extraction, optional timestamp generation, and batch processing.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, high‑performance component for speech‑recognition systems to convert raw CTC logits into accurate transcriptions using beam search, supporting integration with tokenizers and downstream language processing.", "keywords": ["CTC", "beam search", "decoder", "speech recognition", "ASR", "tokenizer", "alignment", "timestamps", "greedy fallback", "log probabilities", "batch decoding", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "a4c4a1c57bbb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:06:42+00:00"}
