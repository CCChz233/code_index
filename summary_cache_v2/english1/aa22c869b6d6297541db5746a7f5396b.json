{"summary": "The script demonstrates how to fine‑tune a FastPitch text‑to‑speech model using adapter modules. It modifies the model configuration to enable adapters, injects a global adapter configuration, and launches a training run with NeMo's experiment manager and PyTorch Lightning.", "business_intent": "Provide a quick way to adapt a pre‑trained speech synthesis model to new voices or domains with minimal additional training, lowering development time and computational cost for customized TTS solutions.", "keywords": ["FastPitch", "text-to-speech", "TTS", "adapter", "fine-tuning", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "Hydra", "model adaptation", "transfer learning"], "summary_hash": "9623341dfd30", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:33:54+00:00"}
