{"summary": "This module implements a PyTorch Lightning strategy that integrates Megatron‑LM style model and tensor parallelism into the NeMo framework. It manages distributed initialization, data loading, forward and backward passes, gradient accumulation, and checkpoint handling, while providing a custom automatic optimization loop tailored for Megatron models and options such as disabling DDP communication hooks for specific AMP configurations.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient, large‑scale training of language models by offering a ready‑to‑use, highly parallelizable training strategy that abstracts the complexities of Megatron parallelism and checkpoint management within the NeMo ecosystem.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "model parallelism", "tensor parallelism", "data parallelism", "PyTorch Lightning", "NeMo", "distributed training", "checkpointing", "automatic optimization", "gradient accumulation", "AMP", "DDP communication hook", "large language models"], "summary_hash": "7a18c049b14f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:50:16+00:00"}
