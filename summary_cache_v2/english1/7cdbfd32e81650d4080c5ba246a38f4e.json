It checks the default behavior, proper handling of error conditions, and correct processing of both NIfTI and PNG image formats.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that image preprocessing reliably converts data to channel‑first layout, ensuring compatibility with downstream deep‑learning models and preventing runtime failures in medical imaging and general computer‑vision pipelines.", "keywords": ["testing", "channel-first", "image preprocessing", "NIfTI", "PNG", "exception handling", "data transformation", "unit tests"], "summary_hash": "7e757ec80e5e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:32:13+00:00"}
