{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe have class CallRateDelayThrottle: helper class to provide service call rate throttling. Provides a decorator to decorate service methods that need to be throttled to not exceed a certain call rate per second.

Uses track_point_in_utc_time to schedule delayed executions; should not block the mainloop.\n\nWe need to summarize class responsibility and state/behavior.
