{"summary": "The module provides a suite of signal‑processing transforms designed for one‑dimensional medical data. It includes utilities for continuous wavelet analysis, handling missing values, adding various synthetic perturbations (Gaussian noise, sinusoidal components, square pulses), random dropping of samples, stochastic scaling and temporal shifting, and frequency‑domain filtering to remove specific components. All transforms are callable and integrate with MONAI’s pipeline architecture.", "business_intent": "Enable robust preprocessing and data augmentation of biomedical signals (e.g., ECG, EEG) to improve the training and evaluation of deep learning models in healthcare imaging applications.", "keywords": ["signal processing", "data augmentation", "medical signals", "wavelet transform", "noise injection", "synthetic waveforms", "sample dropout", "amplitude scaling", "temporal shift", "frequency filtering", "MONAI", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "623b30bc1be2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:23:34+00:00"}
