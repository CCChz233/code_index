{"summary": "A dataset class that supplies triplet samples for deep metric learning, applying ImageNet‑style normalization and size‑specific augmentations (random/resized crops for training, resize or center‑crop for validation) to match the input requirements of common architectures such as ResNet‑50 and GoogLeNet.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to quickly integrate correctly pre‑processed training and validation data into metric‑learning pipelines, reducing preprocessing errors and accelerating model experimentation and deployment.", "keywords": ["triplet dataset", "deep metric learning", "image preprocessing", "augmentation", "normalization", "ImageNet standards", "random cropping", "center cropping", "ResNet‑50", "GoogLeNet", "validation", "training"], "summary_hash": "71e97712b863", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:24:53+00:00"}
