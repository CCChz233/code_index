{"summary": "The module implements a suite of array‑based spatial operations, including affine, rotation, scaling, flipping, elastic deformation, grid distortion, patch extraction, orientation adjustment, spacing conversion, and resampling. Each operation is provided as a transform class that can be applied directly or lazily (deferred) and integrates with MONAI’s metadata handling and tensor utilities.", "business_intent": "Enable robust and configurable spatial preprocessing and data augmentation for medical imaging models, allowing users to manipulate image geometry, simulate acquisition variations, and extract patches while preserving spatial metadata and supporting efficient lazy execution.", "keywords": ["spatial transform", "affine", "rotation", "scaling", "flipping", "elastic deformation", "grid distortion", "patch extraction", "orientation", "spacing", "resampling", "lazy execution", "medical imaging", "data augmentation"], "summary_hash": "0885ae7feb10", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:23:56+00:00"}
