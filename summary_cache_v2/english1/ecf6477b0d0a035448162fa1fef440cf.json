{"summary": "The module implements utilities for converting CTC‑based speech recognition model outputs into token sequences annotated with precise timestamps and logits. It includes a streaming decoder that processes audio in frame batches, classes for computing word error rate while preserving timestamp information for both character‑level and BPE‑level transcriptions, and helper functions for handling default parameters and extracting WER‑related features.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with tools to generate time‑aligned transcriptions and evaluate ASR performance, facilitating tasks such as subtitle generation, audio‑text alignment, speaker diarization, and quality assessment of speech models.", "keywords": ["ASR", "CTC decoding", "timestamps", "word error rate", "BPE", "streaming inference", "logits", "audio alignment", "evaluation", "subtitle generation"], "summary_hash": "fb3edaffece8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:12:16+00:00"}
