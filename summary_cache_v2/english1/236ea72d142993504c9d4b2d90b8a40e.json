{"summary": "This module provides a suite of unit tests for the Qiskit transpiler pass that eliminates diagonal gates positioned directly before measurement operations. The tests cover a range of gate types, control‑flow structures, fixed‑point convergence, and verify that the optimization does not mistakenly remove necessary gates in conditional or special measurement scenarios.", "business_intent": "Ensure the diagonal‑gate removal optimization works correctly and safely during quantum circuit transpilation, improving circuit efficiency while preserving functional behavior across diverse circuit constructs.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "transpiler", "diagonal gate removal", "measurement optimization", "unit testing", "fixed point", "control flow", "over‑optimization prevention", "quantum circuit"], "summary_hash": "1e53042d509e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:46:58+00:00"}
