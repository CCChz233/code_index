{"summary": "The module defines a scenario that runs the health system model under multiple assumptions about the expansion of human‑resource capabilities. It builds mixed parameter sets, configures the model, executes simulations (locally or via the batch system), and records the configuration and outcomes for later analysis.", "business_intent": "To quantify the effects of different health‑system capability expansion strategies on health outcomes, providing evidence for policy decisions on workforce development.", "keywords": ["health system", "scenario modeling", "capability expansion", "human resources", "policy analysis", "simulation", "parameter mixing", "batch execution", "logging"], "summary_hash": "e4bcd2074673", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:58:49+00:00"}
