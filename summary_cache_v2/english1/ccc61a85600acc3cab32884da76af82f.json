{"summary": "This module provides a suite of asynchronous clients for handling Prefect events. It defines an abstract base client that supports context‑manager usage and a unified emit operation, a no‑operation client that silently discards events, and a concrete client that streams events to a Prefect Cloud workspace with connection management, reconnection logic, and checkpointing. Additionally, it includes a subscriber component that maintains a live WebSocket subscription to Prefect Cloud’s event feed, applies optional filters, and yields events as an async iterable.", "business_intent": "To enable Prefect workflows to reliably publish and consume events within Prefect Cloud, offering interchangeable client implementations for production, testing, and fallback scenarios while handling network resilience and event delivery guarantees.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "events", "asynchronous client", "WebSocket", "cloud integration", "event publishing", "event subscription", "reconnection", "checkpointing", "no‑op client", "context manager"], "summary_hash": "3e8859b90bce", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:31:01+00:00"}
