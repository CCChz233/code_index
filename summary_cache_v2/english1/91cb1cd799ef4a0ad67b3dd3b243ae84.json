{"summary": "A dataset class that streams audio files stored in tar archives according to a line‑by‑line JSON manifest, applies duration‑based filtering, optional silence trimming, amplitude normalization, and optional windowing or frame‑shifting for tasks such as speaker recognition or voice‑activity detection. It supports configurable look‑ahead shuffling and distributes tar shards across workers using scatter or replicate strategies for efficient multi‑process or distributed training, while reporting its length based on the filtered manifest entries.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, high‑throughput loading and preprocessing of large tarred audio corpora for machine‑learning pipelines (e.g., speaker identification, VAD, or other audio classification/regression tasks) in single‑node or distributed training environments.", "keywords": ["audio dataset", "tar archive", "manifest parsing", "streaming", "sharding", "distributed training", "duration filtering", "silence trimming", "audio normalization", "windowing", "shuffle buffer", "speaker recognition", "voice activity detection"], "summary_hash": "935bd76bb18a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:09:28+00:00"}
