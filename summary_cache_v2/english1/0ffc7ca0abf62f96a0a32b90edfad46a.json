{"summary": "The module preprocesses the OGB graph property prediction dataset for use with directional Graph Subgraph Networks. It loads raw graphs, optionally converts them to undirected form, computes subgraph‑isomorphism edge statistics and automorphism orbit information, and saves the enriched graphs for downstream training and evaluation.", "business_intent": "Prepare and enrich graph datasets with structural features required for advanced graph neural network models, enabling accurate subgraph‑based learning and prediction tasks.", "keywords": ["OGB", "graph preprocessing", "subgraph isomorphism", "automorphism orbits", "undirected conversion", "dataset generation", "DGL", "PyTorch", "graph-tool", "networkx"], "summary_hash": "eadaaff719ab", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:28:19+00:00"}
