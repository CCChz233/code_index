{"summary": "A DAG-based representation of a quantum circuit that models inputs, outputs, and quantum/classical operations as nodes connected by directed edges for each wire. It supports building the circuit, querying its topology, computing metrics like depth and width, and performing graph transformations such as adding/removing registers, substituting sub‑circuits, and reordering operations.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient analysis, optimization, and compilation of quantum programs by providing a mutable graph structure that captures the causal relationships between gates and registers, facilitating transformations, scheduling, and resource estimation.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "directed acyclic graph", "DAG", "qubits", "classical bits", "gate operations", "graph traversal", "circuit depth", "circuit width", "optimization", "compilation", "register management", "calibration", "causal cone", "topological order", "idle wires"], "summary_hash": "61a7f6b5d831", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:02:32+00:00"}
