The earlier instruction: \"Given file-level metadata and function summaries, output ONLY a JSON object with keys: `summary`, `business_intent`, `keywords` (list).\" It seems per file.

Maybe we need to produce a combined summary for the linalg package? However earlier tasks gave per file. The instruction: \"Given file-level metadata and function summaries, output ONLY a JSON object with keys: `summary`, `business_intent`, `keywords` (list).\" It doesn't say per file.

Let's craft a summary that covers solving linear systems, matrix inverses, least squares, and internal utilities for validation and GPU library handling.\n\nBusiness intent: Provide GPU-accelerated linear equation solving and related utilities for scientific computing.\n\nKeywords: GPU, linear algebra, solve, matrix inverse, pseudo-inverse, least squares, tensor inversion, validation, CuPy, CUDA, high performance computing.\n\nMake sure not to list function names verbatim. Avoid \"solve\", \"inv\", \"pinv\", \"lstsq\". Use generic terms.\n\nNow produce JSON with double braces? They said starting with {{ and ending with }}. That seems like double curly braces. Example: {{\"summary\": \"...\", ...}}. So we need to output double braces. Let's do that.\n\nMake sure JSON is valid: double braces outer, inner object.
