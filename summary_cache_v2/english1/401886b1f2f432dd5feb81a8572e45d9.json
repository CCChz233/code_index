{"summary": "The module implements a scenario‑switching mechanism for the simulation framework. It loads a predefined resource file with health‑system and care‑seeking parameter values and applies those updates before the population is created, ensuring that scenario‑specific settings are in effect from the start of the run. It also defines an event class that encapsulates the data required to trigger a scenario change during the simulation lifecycle.", "business_intent": "Allow modelers to control and experiment with different health‑system and care‑seeking configurations by switching scenarios programmatically, facilitating policy analysis and comparative studies within the simulation environment.", "keywords": ["scenario switching", "health system parameters", "care seeking", "simulation initialization", "event handling", "parameter loading", "policy analysis", "population scope"], "summary_hash": "a79d18c1c805", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:47:58+00:00"}
