{"summary": "The module defines comprehensive test suites for the Stable Diffusion XL pipeline enhanced with Prompt Attention Guidance. It includes fast unit tests that employ mocked components to check layer integration, toggling behavior, inference correctness, and optional component persistence, as well as integration tests that run on actual GPU hardware to validate classifier‑free guidance, unconditional generation, and overall pipeline functionality.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correct implementation of Prompt Attention Guidance within the Stable Diffusion XL image generation pipeline, ensuring reliable performance for downstream applications and facilitating continuous development.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion xl", "prompt attention guidance", "pipeline testing", "unit tests", "integration tests", "mock components", "classifier-free guidance", "unconditional generation", "torch", "diffusers"], "summary_hash": "ea7b5481e1fd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:48:23+00:00"}
