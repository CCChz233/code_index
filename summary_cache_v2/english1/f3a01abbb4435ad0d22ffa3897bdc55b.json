{"summary": "This module provides a composite tokenizer that combines multiple language‑specific tokenizers into a single multilingual tokenizer, assigning distinct token‑ID intervals to each language to allow encoding, routing, and later reconstruction with the original tokenizers. It also includes a lightweight dummy tokenizer that maintains a vocabulary mapping for downstream text processing.", "business_intent": "Facilitate multilingual text handling in NeMo models by offering a unified tokenizer interface, simplifying preprocessing and post‑processing for speech and language applications that need to operate across several languages.", "keywords": ["multilingual tokenizer", "aggregate tokenizer", "token ID interval", "language routing", "vocabulary mapping", "dummy tokenizer", "NeMo", "speech AI", "text processing", "language models"], "summary_hash": "5f84fcde69ca", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:52:34+00:00"}
