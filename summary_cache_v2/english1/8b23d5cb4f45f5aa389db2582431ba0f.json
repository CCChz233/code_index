{"summary": "This module implements a Python wrapper for the MAPDL node database, exposing properties such as total and selected node counts, maximum node identifier, and providing methods to retrieve node indices, coordinates, and orientation angles as NumPy arrays, as well as to query individual node selection status. It communicates with the MAPDL gRPC service and handles runtime errors.", "business_intent": "Enable engineers and developers to access and analyze node information from ANSYS MAPDL simulations directly within Python, facilitating data extraction, post‑processing, and integration with scientific computing workflows.", "keywords": ["MAPDL", "node database", "Python API", "gRPC", "NumPy", "coordinates", "orientation angles", "selection status", "engineering simulation", "ANSYS"], "summary_hash": "c2e49cf29c13", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:00:31+00:00"}
