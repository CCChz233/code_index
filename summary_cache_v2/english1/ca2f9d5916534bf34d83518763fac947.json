{"summary": "This module implements a parallelized DDPM diffusion scheduler, handling configuration, beta schedule computation, and stepwise sample updates across multiple timesteps. It also provides a lightweight output container for the scheduler's results and helper utilities for beta generation and signal‑to‑noise ratio rescaling.", "business_intent": "To enable faster and more flexible inference of diffusion‑based generative models by offering a parallel scheduling mechanism that can be integrated into AI pipelines for image, audio, or other media generation.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "DDPM", "parallel scheduler", "beta schedule", "SNR rescaling", "torch", "generative AI", "sampling", "configuration", "Karras diffusion"], "summary_hash": "583b934c53d3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:12:39+00:00"}
