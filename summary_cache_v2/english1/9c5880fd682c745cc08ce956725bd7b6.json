{"summary": "A unit‑test module that checks the MONAI utilities for dynamically swapping neural‑network sub‑modules. It verifies that module replacement updates internal counters correctly, raises appropriate errors for invalid inputs, and that the temporary replacement context manager restores the original architecture after use.", "business_intent": "Ensure the robustness and correctness of MONAI's dynamic module replacement features, providing confidence to developers and end‑users that model modifications behave as expected during training and inference.", "keywords": ["testing", "dynamic module replacement", "MONAI", "DenseNet121", "replace_modules", "temporary replacement", "context manager", "module count tracking", "error handling", "unit tests", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "a9b981c4b5df", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:24:03+00:00"}
