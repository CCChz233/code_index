{"summary": "Implements an image-only augmentation that randomly selects a subset of channels in an image and replaces their pixel values with a constant fill value. The number of channels to drop is drawn from a configurable range and the operation respects a probability parameter, with schema validation ensuring compatibility with the image dimensions.", "business_intent": "Enhance training data diversity for computer vision models by simulating missing or corrupted color channels, thereby improving model robustness and generalization.", "keywords": ["channel dropout", "image augmentation", "random channel removal", "fill value", "probability", "schema validation", "Albumentations", "computer vision", "data preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "9cef60e195c5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:28:56+00:00"}
