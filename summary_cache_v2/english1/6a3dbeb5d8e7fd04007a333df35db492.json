{"summary": "A wrapper that constructs a VoxelMorph registration pipeline: it concatenates moving and fixed images, feeds them to a user‑provided backbone network that predicts a stationary velocity field (or displacement field), optionally integrates the velocity into a diffeomorphic displacement field using scaling‑and‑squaring (with optional half‑resolution processing), and finally warps the moving image to the fixed image, outputting the warped image and the displacement field.", "business_intent": "To deliver a configurable, end‑to‑end deep‑learning solution for deformable medical image registration that can operate in diffeomorphic or non‑diffeomorphic mode and allows easy substitution of backbone architectures.", "keywords": ["deformable registration", "diffeomorphic transformation", "stationary velocity field", "scaling and squaring", "image warping", "backbone network", "medical imaging", "deep learning", "VoxelMorph"], "summary_hash": "ceca034160df", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:38:17+00:00"}
