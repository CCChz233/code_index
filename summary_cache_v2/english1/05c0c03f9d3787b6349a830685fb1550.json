{"summary": "The module provides a suite of unit tests aimed at validating the functionality of a helper that generates a dictionary mapping physical types to their corresponding Astropy units. However, several test cases appear to be unused or serve as placeholders, suggesting incomplete or dead test code.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the utility for constructing physical type-to-unit mappings works correctly and raises appropriate errors for invalid inputs, thereby supporting reliable unit handling within the larger scientific library.", "keywords": ["unit helper", "physical type dictionary", "Astropy units", "test suite", "error handling", "placeholder", "dead code"], "summary_hash": "b9e00643fc86", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:06:04+00:00"}
