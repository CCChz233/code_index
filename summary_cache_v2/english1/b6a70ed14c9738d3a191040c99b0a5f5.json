{"summary": "The module implements an evaluator that measures the F1 performance of a cross‑encoder on labeled sentence‑pair datasets. It automatically chooses between binary and macro‑averaged F1 based on label distribution, logs the results, and can write them to a CSV file for later analysis.", "business_intent": "To give developers and data scientists a ready‑to‑use component for validating and comparing cross‑encoder models in classification scenarios, supporting model selection, monitoring, and reporting of accuracy metrics.", "keywords": ["cross-encoder", "evaluation", "F1 score", "binary classification", "macro F1", "sentence pairs", "CSV export", "sklearn", "logging", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "4098890a887d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:56:45+00:00"}
