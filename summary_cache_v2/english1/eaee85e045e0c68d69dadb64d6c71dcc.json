{"summary": "Provides a specialized Trainer class for supervised fine‑tuning of causal language models. It wraps HuggingFace’s Trainer, handling dataset preprocessing, tokenization, constant‑length formatting, optional PEFT/LoRA casting, and integration with Accelerate state. The class also supports generation of model cards and evaluation utilities.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to efficiently fine‑tune large language models on custom instruction or completion datasets, streamlining the workflow for creating high‑quality, task‑specific models.", "keywords": ["supervised fine-tuning", "language model", "HuggingFace Trainer", "dataset preprocessing", "tokenization", "PEFT", "LoRA", "Accelerate", "data collator", "model card generation"], "summary_hash": "fc58f4f9f839", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:59:23+00:00"}
