{"summary": "This module contains unit tests that verify the behavior of the OptimizeSwapBeforeMeasure transpiler pass. The tests check that swap operations followed by measurements are correctly moved, merged, reordered, or left unchanged across various circuit structures, including simple sequences, control‑flow constructs, and fixed‑point iterations.", "business_intent": "Validate and ensure the correctness of quantum circuit optimization that relocates swap gates before measurements, thereby improving circuit depth and execution fidelity in the Qiskit transpilation workflow.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "transpiler", "OptimizeSwapBeforeMeasure", "unit tests", "swap gate", "measurement", "circuit optimization", "control flow", "fixed point", "DAG", "PassManager"], "summary_hash": "09e530ca999f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:51:59+00:00"}
