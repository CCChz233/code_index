{"summary": "A configuration container that encapsulates all hyperparameters required to build the text encoder part of a GroupViT model, such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, activation function, dropout rates, and initialization settings. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration base, allowing seamless integration with model loading and serialization workflows.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with a flexible, reproducible way to specify and modify the architecture of the GroupViT text transformer, enabling easy instantiation of pretrained models or custom variants while ensuring consistent handling of model metadata.", "keywords": ["configuration", "GroupViT", "text encoder", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "dropout", "activation", "initialization", "pretrained model"], "summary_hash": "05e2b5c9820a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:46:17+00:00"}
