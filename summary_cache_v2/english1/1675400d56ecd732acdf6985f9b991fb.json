{"summary": "Implements an attention-based graph convolution layer that computes a propagation matrix from node feature cosine similarities scaled by a beta parameter and applies it to propagate features across the graph. Includes optional learnable beta and a flag to control handling of zero‑in‑degree nodes.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use graph neural network component for semi‑supervised learning tasks that leverages attention mechanisms to weight neighbor contributions, with configurable parameter learning and safety checks for isolated nodes.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "attention", "cosine similarity", "beta scaling", "message passing", "zero in-degree handling", "semi-supervised learning", "DGL", "graph convolution"], "summary_hash": "f118cc29c106", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:52:57+00:00"}
