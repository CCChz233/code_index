{"summary": "A comprehensive test suite for the Kandinsky V2.2 diffusion pipelines, covering generation, ControlNet, image‑to‑image, inpainting, prior, and embedding‑to‑embedding variants. The tests include lightweight dummy components for fast unit checks and full integration runs on real models, validating deterministic outputs, mixed‑precision handling, batch consistency, callback execution, CPU offload, serialization, and overall image quality.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability, correctness, and performance of Kandinsky V2.2 pipelines so that downstream applications can depend on stable image generation, efficient resource usage, and seamless model deployment.", "keywords": ["Kandinsky", "V2.2", "diffusion", "pipeline", "testing", "unit tests", "integration tests", "dummy components", "image generation", "ControlNet", "img2img", "inpainting", "prior", "embedding", "deterministic", "serialization", "GPU", "float16", "batch processing", "CPU offload"], "summary_hash": "937fce560d0e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:36:11+00:00"}
