{"summary": "This module supplies a collection of decorator utilities that integrate VizTracer tracing into user functions. It offers wrappers to automatically start and stop a VizTracer instance around a function call, optionally persisting the trace data, handling multiprocessing contexts, and providing mechanisms to exclude certain functions from tracing or to record sparse logs.", "business_intent": "Facilitate effortless performance profiling and execution visualization for Python applications by allowing developers to annotate functions with tracing decorators, thereby generating detailed execution traces without manual tracer management.", "keywords": ["tracing", "decorator", "profiling", "visualization", "VizTracer", "performance analysis", "ignore", "sparse logging", "multiprocessing", "trace saving"], "summary_hash": "2c9521f64e01", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:35:20+00:00"}
