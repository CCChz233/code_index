{"summary": "The module implements the core components of a diffusion‑based audio generation model, including a configurable transformer block with self‑ and cross‑attention, a full transformer architecture that encodes and decodes audio waveforms into latent spaces, and a Gaussian Fourier projection for embedding noise levels. These pieces are designed to be flexible (e.g., variable attention heads, optional QK normalization, dropout, gradient checkpointing) and integrate conditioning information such as timesteps and global state.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, high‑performance transformer backbone for building Stable Audio diffusion models, enabling developers to create or fine‑tune audio synthesis systems that generate realistic sound from noise or conditioned inputs.", "keywords": ["audio diffusion", "transformer", "self‑attention", "cross‑attention", "Gaussian Fourier projection", "latent audio representation", "gradient checkpointing", "conditioning", "noise embedding", "stable audio"], "summary_hash": "7921900b02b1", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:30:43+00:00"}
