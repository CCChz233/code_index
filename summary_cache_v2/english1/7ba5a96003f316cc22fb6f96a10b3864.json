{"summary": "The module implements a configurable 2‑D UNet architecture tailored for diffusion models. It integrates timestep embeddings, Gaussian Fourier projections, and assembles down‑sampling, mid, and up‑sampling blocks to produce latent feature maps, encapsulated in a lightweight output container.", "business_intent": "Supply a reusable neural network component that powers image generation and other 2‑D generative tasks within diffusion pipelines, allowing developers to customize depth, channels, and conditioning mechanisms.", "keywords": ["UNet", "2D", "diffusion model", "timestep embedding", "downsampling", "upsampling", "PyTorch", "configurable architecture", "image synthesis", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "835de66a461b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:29:04+00:00"}
