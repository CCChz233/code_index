{"summary": "A configurable decoder that transforms a spatial latent tensor into an image through a hierarchical cascade of upsampling convolutions, residual blocks, group normalization, and optional attention mechanisms (including non‑local, flash, and combined linear projections). It supports 1D/2D/3D data, channel splitting, and memory‑saving options such as ConvTranspose upsampling and CUDA cache cleanup.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient and high‑quality reconstruction or generation of images from compressed representations in deep learning pipelines, particularly for applications requiring flexible dimensionality, attention‑enhanced decoding, and optimized GPU memory usage.", "keywords": ["decoder", "upsampling", "convolutional cascade", "residual blocks", "group normalization", "attention", "non‑local attention", "flash attention", "convtranspose", "multi‑dimensional", "memory optimization", "tensor splitting", "latent space", "image synthesis"], "summary_hash": "6eea4873b510", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:19:02+00:00"}
