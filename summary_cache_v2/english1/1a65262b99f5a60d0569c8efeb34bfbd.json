{"summary": "A neural network layer that normalizes input tensors by partitioning the channel dimension into configurable groups, computing per‑group mean and variance, and optionally applying learnable scaling and offset, while preserving the original tensor shape.", "business_intent": "Offer a stable and flexible normalization technique for deep learning models that performs reliably with small batch sizes and can emulate layer or instance normalization by adjusting group settings, thereby enhancing training convergence and model accuracy.", "keywords": ["group normalization", "deep learning", "normalization layer", "channel grouping", "mean variance", "learnable scale", "learnable offset", "small batch stability", "Keras", "TensorFlow"], "summary_hash": "1e0d038a1f20", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:58:00+00:00"}
