{"summary": "Implements a zero‑shot text‑to‑video diffusion pipeline based on the SDXL architecture. It defines cross‑frame attention processors to share information across video frames, a structured output container for generated frames, and a pipeline class that orchestrates model loading, prompt encoding, latent diffusion, and decoding into image sequences.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to generate short video clips directly from textual descriptions without additional training, providing a ready‑to‑use, configurable diffusion workflow that integrates with existing SDXL models and supports advanced features such as classifier‑free guidance and LoRA adaptation.", "keywords": ["text-to-video", "diffusion pipeline", "SDXL", "zero-shot generation", "cross-frame attention", "video synthesis", "classifier-free guidance", "LoRA", "PyTorch", "UNet", "VAE", "CLIP", "scheduler"], "summary_hash": "3f119fa7ecb4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:18:29+00:00"}
