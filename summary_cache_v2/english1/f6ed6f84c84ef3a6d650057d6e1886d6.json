{"summary": "The module implements a collection of device‑agnostic tensor utilities that support broadcasting, gathering, padding, reduction, slicing and precision conversion across CPUs, GPUs, TPUs and other accelerators. It also provides helpers for handling distributed tensor shapes, converting half‑precision outputs to full precision, and managing tensor metadata in multi‑process environments.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless, hardware‑independent tensor manipulation for distributed deep‑learning workloads, simplifying the development of models that run on single or multiple GPUs, TPUs, or other accelerator types while maintaining correct precision and shape handling.", "keywords": ["tensor operations", "distributed training", "broadcast", "gather", "pad", "reduce", "slice", "precision conversion", "fp16", "fp32", "TPU", "GPU", "multi‑GPU", "accelerator", "device‑agnostic", "tensor metadata"], "summary_hash": "46708cedbf51", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:18:37+00:00"}
