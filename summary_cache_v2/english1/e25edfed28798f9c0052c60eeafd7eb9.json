{"summary": "The module implements a suite of iterative linear solvers for groundwater flow and contaminant transport simulations, including generalized and preconditioned conjugate‑gradient methods and parallel Krylov‑subspace algorithms. It provides infrastructure for domain partitioning, load‑balanced parallel execution, convergence monitoring, and optional preconditioning or deflation techniques, enabling scalable numerical solutions of implicit discretizations in MODFLOW‑based water‑quality models.", "business_intent": "To deliver high‑performance, scalable computational tools that accelerate and improve the accuracy of groundwater flow and transport modeling for environmental consulting, regulatory analysis, and water‑resource management applications.", "keywords": ["iterative solver", "conjugate gradient", "Krylov subspace", "parallel computing", "groundwater flow", "contaminant transport", "preconditioning", "load balancing", "domain partitioning", "MODFLOW", "water quality modeling"], "summary_hash": "a4391cef0363", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:47:08+00:00"}
