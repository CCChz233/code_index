{"summary": "The module defines a set of loss components used to train a RAD‑based text‑to‑speech model. It includes a regularizer that pushes attention matrices toward binary values, a term that measures the error in predicted speaker or style attributes, and a composite loss that aggregates alignment, flow‑based, and regression objectives for end‑to‑end TTS training.", "business_intent": "Provide a robust training objective for neural speech synthesis systems, enabling higher‑quality, controllable TTS generation by enforcing accurate alignment, realistic acoustic flow modeling, and correct attribute conditioning.", "keywords": ["text-to-speech", "loss function", "attention regularization", "attribute prediction", "flow modeling", "regression loss", "NeMo", "PyTorch", "neural network training"], "summary_hash": "ad6f26416d0b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:56:25+00:00"}
