{"summary": "A synthetic dataset that programmatically creates a collection of graphs belonging to eight predefined structural classes (cycle, star, wheel, lollipop, hypercube, grid, clique, circular ladder). The class generates a specified number of graphs with node counts within a configurable range, assigns a class label to each graph, and implements the standard sequence protocol so the data can be indexed, iterated, and batched for graph neural network training.", "business_intent": "Supply ready‑made, reproducible graph classification data for research and development of graph learning models, enabling rapid benchmarking, model validation, and educational experiments without requiring external data sources.", "keywords": ["synthetic graph dataset", "graph classification", "DGL", "graph neural networks", "benchmark", "random graph generation", "cycle graph", "star graph", "wheel graph", "lollipop graph", "hypercube graph", "grid graph", "clique graph", "circular ladder graph", "iterable dataset", "mini‑batch training"], "summary_hash": "f956e30b3f13", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:45:34+00:00"}
