{"summary": "The module implements the UnCLIP diffusion pipelines, offering a high‑level interface for generating images from textual prompts and for creating variations of existing images. It coordinates a prior transformer, a decoder UNet, and a scheduler, handling tokenization, CLIP embedding projection, latent preparation, and post‑processing, including optional super‑resolution. Additionally, it provides a model that maps CLIP text (and optional image) embeddings into the latent space required by the decoder.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to integrate state‑of‑the‑art text‑to‑image and image‑variation generation capabilities into applications, leveraging the UnCLIP architecture for creative content creation and visual augmentation.", "keywords": ["UnCLIP", "diffusion pipeline", "text-to-image generation", "image variation", "prior transformer", "decoder UNet", "scheduler", "CLIP embedding projection", "latent space", "super-resolution", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "c8a5cf0c441f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:41:34+00:00"}
