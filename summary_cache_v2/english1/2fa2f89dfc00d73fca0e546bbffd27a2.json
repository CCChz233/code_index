{"summary": "Implements a configurable Transformer architecture designed to process video-like data, supporting both continuous and discrete latent representations. It stacks multiple Transformer blocks with multi‑head self‑attention (optionally double), optional cross‑attention, feed‑forward networks with selectable activation, and positional embeddings. The model exposes parameters for heads, dimensions, layers, dropout, bias, and normalization, allowing adaptation to various video generation or analysis tasks.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible backbone for diffusion or generative models that need to model temporal dependencies in video sequences, enabling high‑quality video synthesis, frame prediction, or video‑conditioned image generation.", "keywords": ["transformer", "video", "temporal modeling", "multi-head attention", "cross attention", "positional embeddings", "feed-forward network", "activation function", "dropout", "normalization", "latent representation", "continuous input", "discrete input"], "summary_hash": "1787e32e46e9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:38:41+00:00"}
