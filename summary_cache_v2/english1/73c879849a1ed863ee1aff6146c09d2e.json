{"summary": "This module provides a comprehensive training pipeline for fine‑tuning a ControlNet model built on Stable Diffusion 3. It handles argument parsing, dataset preparation, image and caption preprocessing, loading of text encoders and diffusion components, computation of training targets, and orchestrates distributed training using Accelerate. The script also manages checkpoint saving, optional validation logging, and model card generation.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to train custom ControlNet extensions for Stable Diffusion 3, allowing specialized image generation conditioned on control inputs such as depth or edge maps, and to deploy the resulting models with proper documentation and versioning.", "keywords": ["ControlNet", "Stable Diffusion 3", "diffusion model training", "distributed training", "accelerate", "dataset preprocessing", "text encoding", "scheduler", "checkpointing", "model card"], "summary_hash": "3225d0093007", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:57:56+00:00"}
