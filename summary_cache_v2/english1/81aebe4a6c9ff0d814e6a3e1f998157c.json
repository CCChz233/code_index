{"summary": "A utility class that lazily reads, modifies, and writes Git‑style configuration files. It parses sections and options, handles include directives, converts values between strings and native types, and ensures exclusive access through file locking. The class can be used as a context manager to automatically release locks and persist changes when the instance is closed.", "business_intent": "Provide applications with a safe, programmatic way to manage Git configuration files, guaranteeing atomic updates and preventing concurrent write conflicts.", "keywords": ["git", "configuration", "parser", "file lock", "context manager", "lazy loading", "serialization", "deserialization", "case-sensitive", "include handling"], "summary_hash": "6c010af02e0a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:41:17+00:00"}
