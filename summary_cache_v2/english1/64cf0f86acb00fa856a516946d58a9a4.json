{"summary": "This module supplies placeholder implementations for Stable Diffusion pipelines that rely on k‑diffusion samplers. It defines lightweight pipeline classes that mimic the interface of full‑featured pipelines, handling configuration and weight loading in a dummy fashion so that the package can be imported even when heavy back‑end libraries such as torch, transformers, or k‑diffusion are unavailable.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless installation and import of the diffusion library in constrained environments by providing fallback pipeline objects, thereby supporting documentation, testing, and lightweight usage without requiring the full machine‑learning stack.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "k-diffusion", "pipeline", "dummy implementation", "fallback", "torch", "transformers", "model loading", "text-to-image", "dependency management"], "summary_hash": "3ed037861c7a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:10:26+00:00"}
