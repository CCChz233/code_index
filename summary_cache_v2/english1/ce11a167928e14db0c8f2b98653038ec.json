{"summary": "The module defines a collection of custom neural network layers for graph processing using DGL and PyTorch. It includes a combined convolution‑pool‑readout component, a hierarchical pooling layer that learns a refined adjacency and selects nodes based on a pooling ratio, a node‑importance scoring layer based on random‑walk differences, and a weighted graph convolution that incorporates edge weights into the message passing.", "business_intent": "To supply reusable components that enable developers to build graph neural network models with hierarchical coarsening and edge‑aware convolutions, facilitating tasks such as graph classification, node ranking, and representation learning in domains like chemistry, social network analysis, and recommendation systems.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "hierarchical pooling", "edge‑weighted convolution", "DGL", "PyTorch", "node importance scoring", "graph coarsening", "readout layer", "adjacency learning"], "summary_hash": "d065f91b30cc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:16:56+00:00"}
