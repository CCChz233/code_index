{"summary": "A diffusion‑based pipeline that transforms a single RGB image into dense per‑pixel surface‑normal vectors using the Marigold approach. It orchestrates a conditional UNet, a variational auto‑encoder, a diffusion scheduler, and a CLIP text encoder to encode the input, perform denoising diffusion, decode the latent representation into normal maps, optionally aggregate multiple samples, and normalize the resulting vectors.", "business_intent": "Provide developers, researchers, and product teams with an easy‑to‑use tool for extracting accurate 3D orientation information from ordinary photographs, enabling applications such as augmented reality placement, robotic perception, scene understanding, and 3D content creation without requiring specialized depth sensors.", "keywords": ["monocular normal estimation", "diffusion pipeline", "surface normals", "Marigold", "UNet", "VAE", "diffusion scheduler", "CLIP", "image-to-normal", "3D reconstruction", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "6ba0e496f504", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:24:07+00:00"}
