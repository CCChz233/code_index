{"summary": "The module implements a unittest suite that runs parameterized test scenarios to validate the correctness of MONAI's reloaded binary and categorical metric calculators. It feeds synthetic prediction and ground‑truth tensors of varying shapes, data types, and edge conditions into the metric classes and asserts that the resulting metric values match the expected outcomes.", "business_intent": "To guarantee accurate evaluation of segmentation models in medical imaging workflows by automatically testing and confirming the reliability of metric computations before deployment.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "metric validation", "binary classification", "categorical classification", "MONAI", "PyTorch", "numpy", "parameterized tests", "medical imaging", "segmentation evaluation"], "summary_hash": "651d9a04ba9b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:54:40+00:00"}
