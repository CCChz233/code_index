{"summary": "The module defines a set of graph‑based decoders for automatic speech recognition using the k2 library. It provides an abstract base decoder and concrete implementations for Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) decoding, RNNT forced alignment, and token‑level language‑model decoding, each capable of constructing and traversing various graph topologies to turn model logits into label sequences or alignments.", "business_intent": "Enable speech‑recognition systems to generate transcriptions and perform precise forced alignment by leveraging efficient graph operations, supporting multiple decoding strategies (CTC, RNNT, token LM) and configurable topologies for production‑grade ASR pipelines.", "keywords": ["ASR", "decoder", "CTC", "RNNT", "token language model", "graph", "k2", "forced alignment", "topology", "Viterbi", "emission FSA", "PyTorch", "configuration"], "summary_hash": "b822d969b476", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:14:00+00:00"}
