{"summary": "The module provides a comprehensive set of unit tests that verify the correct computation of concatenated minimum permutation word error rate (cpWER) and related diarization error rate (DER) statistics. It covers scenarios such as single‑word inputs, over‑ and under‑counting, perfect matches, speaker confusion combined with ASR errors, and also checks auxiliary utilities for online DER aggregation and partial reference label extraction.", "business_intent": "Validate and guarantee the reliability of speech diarization and ASR evaluation metrics used in production systems, ensuring accurate performance reporting and model benchmarking.", "keywords": ["cpWER", "diarization", "ASR", "word error rate", "DER", "unit testing", "pytest", "PyTorch", "permutations", "metrics validation"], "summary_hash": "2befbe8419bd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:29:42+00:00"}
