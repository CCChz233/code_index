{"summary": "A unit‑test module that validates the functionality of a pathology probability non‑maximum suppression utility. It defines a set of 2‑D and 3‑D test cases, runs the NMS algorithm on synthetic probability maps, and checks that the resulting suppressed outputs meet expected criteria such as correct shape, threshold handling, and proper selection of maximal values.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of the probability‑based NMS step used in medical pathology image analysis pipelines, thereby supporting reliable region detection and downstream diagnostic workflows.", "keywords": ["pathology", "probability", "non-maximum suppression", "NMS", "unit testing", "2D", "3D", "MONAI", "torch", "numpy", "parameterized"], "summary_hash": "a9e9458f22a9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:26:34+00:00"}
