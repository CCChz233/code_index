{"summary": "A collection of enterprise‑grade guardrail modules that integrate with the LLM proxy to enforce content safety, compliance, and access control. Each hook runs asynchronously, prepares and sends requests to external moderation services (e.g., Aporia AI, Google, OpenAI, Llama Guard), checks for prohibited keywords, blocked users, and secret leaks, caches results, logs detailed diagnostics, and decides whether to allow, modify, or reject a request before or after the language model call.", "business_intent": "Enable organizations to securely deploy large language models by automatically filtering harmful or disallowed content, preventing credential exposure, enforcing policy‑based keyword bans, and restricting access for blocked users, thereby reducing legal risk, protecting proprietary data, and maintaining compliance with corporate and regulatory standards.", "keywords": ["enterprise moderation", "content guardrails", "asynchronous hooks", "caching", "logging", "prohibited keywords", "blocked users", "secret detection", "API integration", "OpenAI moderation", "Google moderation", "Aporia AI", "Llama Guard", "LLM safety"], "summary_hash": "1697018d5c7f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:04:06+00:00"}
