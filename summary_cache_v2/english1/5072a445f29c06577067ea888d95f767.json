{"summary": "A configuration container that holds all architectural and training hyper‑parameters for a Mistral transformer model, such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, sliding‑window settings, activation function, and token identifiers. It inherits from a generic pretrained‑config base so the same object can be passed to the model constructor to reproduce a specific Mistral‑7B variant or a custom variant.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to define, share, and reuse the exact model specifications needed to instantiate a Mistral model, ensuring consistent model creation, easy experimentation with architectural tweaks, and seamless integration with the Transformers library.", "keywords": ["configuration", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "Mistral", "model architecture", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "sliding window", "RoPE", "dropout", "cache", "token ids", "tie embeddings", "pretrained config"], "summary_hash": "2cb0e7969648", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:13:17+00:00"}
