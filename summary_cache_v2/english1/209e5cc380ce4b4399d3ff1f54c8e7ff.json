{"summary": "The package serves a web‑based monitoring tool that handles HTTP requests for an order‑book view, builds visualizations (depth charts, histograms, tables) and auxiliary pages (fidelity bond, sybil‑resistance), and supplies supporting data such as counter‑party counts and custom sorting. It also includes a calculation engine that models sybil‑attack success by converting coin stakes into influence weights, navigating a probability tree, and estimating the likelihood that top participants can compromise the system.", "business_intent": "Enable traders, analysts, and system operators to observe live market depth and order‑book metrics while evaluating the platform’s vulnerability to sybil attacks, thereby supporting operational decisions, risk assessment, and security planning.", "keywords": ["orderbook", "depth chart", "size histogram", "fidelity bond", "sybil resistance", "web dashboard", "HTTP request handling", "visualization", "probability modeling", "attack simulation", "influence weight", "counterparty count", "risk assessment"], "summary_hash": "64c8e88bfe47", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:22:57+00:00"}
