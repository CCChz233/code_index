{"summary": "The module implements low‑level cropping utilities and a high‑level transform that extracts fixed‑size patches from images while automatically adjusting associated masks, bounding boxes, and keypoints. It supports centered, random, and mask‑guided crops, optional padding, and ensures annotation consistency after cropping.", "business_intent": "To provide robust image cropping augmentation capabilities that preserve and update all related annotations, facilitating the creation of diverse training data for computer‑vision models and improving their generalization.", "keywords": ["image cropping", "data augmentation", "mask guided crop", "random crop", "bounding box adjustment", "keypoint transformation", "padding", "computer vision preprocessing", "annotation consistency"], "summary_hash": "2cce4f48e465", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:30:12+00:00"}
