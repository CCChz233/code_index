{"summary": "A configurable convolutional layer that supports arbitrary spatial dimensions, channel specifications, and optional splitting of the input tensor along a chosen axis. It can process each split separately, concatenate results, optionally display configuration details, and manage GPU memory by clearing caches.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible and memory‑efficient convolution operations in deep‑learning pipelines, especially for large or high‑dimensional data such as medical images, by allowing custom split handling and optional diagnostics.", "keywords": ["convolution", "tensor split", "memory optimization", "GPU cache", "spatial dimensions", "channel handling", "deep learning", "MONAI", "custom layer", "diagnostic output"], "summary_hash": "4a2f2c30f5ec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:18:43+00:00"}
