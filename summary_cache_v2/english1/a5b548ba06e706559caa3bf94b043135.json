{"summary": "The module defines an adapter class for the MODFLOW‑6 well (WEL) package. It provides methods to build, convert, and read well specifications expressed in the MODFLOW‑6 list format, handling time‑varying data and translating between cell‑identifier based datasets (layer, row, column) and the array structures required by the simulator.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless preparation and processing of well data for MODFLOW‑6 simulations, supporting both low‑level cell‑id inputs and higher‑level GIS‑linked representations, and simplifying the workflow for time‑dependent well boundary conditions.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW 6", "well package", "adapter", "cell identifier", "dataset conversion", "time‑varying", "list format", "groundwater modeling", "GIS integration", "boundary condition"], "summary_hash": "982a5e3eb480", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:48:41+00:00"}
