{"summary": "Provides a parameterized quantum circuit template that implements a CX-like operation using a sequence of RZX, RZ, and RX gates. The circuit is expressed in Qiskit and can be used during transpilation to map logical two‑qubit gates onto hardware that natively supports RZX interactions.", "business_intent": "Facilitate efficient compilation of quantum algorithms on devices with native RZX couplings by offering a reusable decomposition of controlled‑NOT behavior, thereby improving gate fidelity and reducing circuit depth in quantum software stacks.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "RZX gate", "CX decomposition", "parameterized template", "Qiskit", "two‑qubit gate synthesis", "quantum compilation", "RZ rotation", "RX rotation", "hardware‑aware transpilation"], "summary_hash": "2fc1625ed21b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:20:50+00:00"}
