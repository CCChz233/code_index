{"summary": "The module defines a trainer that orchestrates the full PPO fine‑tuning workflow for language models, covering dataset loading, repeated prompt sampling, response generation, reward evaluation, PPO‑based policy and value updates, periodic evaluation, and checkpoint management. It also provides a wrapper that merges distinct policy and value networks into a unified interface for streamlined inference.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use solution for organizations to align large language models with desired behaviors through reinforcement learning, accelerating the development of safe and effective AI products.", "keywords": ["PPO", "reinforcement learning", "policy optimization", "language model fine‑tuning", "training loop", "data loading", "generation", "evaluation", "checkpointing", "policy/value wrapper", "accelerate", "deep speed", "transformers"], "summary_hash": "12e3166a5b76", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:03:03+00:00"}
