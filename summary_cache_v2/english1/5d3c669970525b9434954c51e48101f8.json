{"summary": "The module implements a collection of utilities that enable lazy evaluation and proxying of objects in Django. It defines base classes for promise-like proxies, lazy objects that defer instantiation until first use, and a cached property decorator that computes a value once per instance. It also provides helper functions for creating and handling lazy proxies, currying callables, and preserving lazy behavior across serialization.", "business_intent": "To improve performance and reduce unnecessary work by postponing the creation of expensive objects or computations until they are actually needed, while offering a transparent interface that behaves like the real object.", "keywords": ["lazy evaluation", "proxy", "lazy object", "cached property", "promise", "deferred instantiation", "curry", "decorator", "serialization", "performance"], "summary_hash": "8b34f1368b31", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:19:40+00:00"}
