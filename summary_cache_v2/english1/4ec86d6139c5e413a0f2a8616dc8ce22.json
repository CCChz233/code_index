{"summary": "The module provides a suite of unit tests and helper utilities for verifying the behavior of attention pattern generation and sparsity configuration classes in the xformers library. It includes functions to create 2D grids, compute axial distances, and generate local or Gaussian patterns, and contains test cases that compare expected layouts, pattern conversions, and specific sparsity configurations such as ALiBi, BigBird, Longformer, dense, fixed, and variable.", "business_intent": "Validate that various attention pattern implementations and sparsity configurations produce correct sparse attention masks, ensuring reliable and efficient transformer model performance.", "keywords": ["attention patterns", "sparsity configuration", "unit testing", "grid generation", "axial distance", "local pattern", "Gaussian distribution", "layout conversion", "ALiBi", "BigBird", "Longformer", "dense", "fixed", "variable", "PyTorch", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "4d2ddfd29de5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:25:46+00:00"}
