{"summary": "The module provides lightweight proxy objects that stand in for CuPy arrays and scalars within the fusion system. These proxies expose dtype and shape information and overload arithmetic, logical, and reduction operators so that Python code can be captured as an expression tree and later emitted as optimized GPU kernel code. It also includes a utility to configure dtype conversion mappings used during code generation.", "business_intent": "Enable just‑in‑time kernel fusion in CuPy by allowing developers to write natural Python expressions that are transformed into high‑performance GPU kernels, thereby reducing overhead of multiple elementwise calls and improving overall computational efficiency.", "keywords": ["CuPy", "fusion", "proxy objects", "array proxy", "scalar proxy", "operator overloading", "JIT compilation", "GPU kernel generation", "dtype handling", "performance optimization"], "summary_hash": "c246749984d5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:22:07+00:00"}
