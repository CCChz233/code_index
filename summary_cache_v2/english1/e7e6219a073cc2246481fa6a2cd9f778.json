{"summary": "An example script that trains NeMo speech enhancement models (audio‑to‑audio) using PyTorch Lightning. It supports multiple model categories (encoder‑decoder, predictive, score‑based generative), allows configuration via Hydra/CLI, and sets up data manifests and trainer parameters for CPU or GPU execution.", "business_intent": "Provide users with a ready‑to‑run reference for building and training speech denoising/ enhancement systems, enabling rapid experimentation and deployment of noise‑reduction models.", "keywords": ["speech enhancement", "audio denoising", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "training script", "Hydra configuration", "CLI", "encoder‑decoder model", "predictive model", "generative model"], "summary_hash": "64ceaa1a7f01", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:35:41+00:00"}
