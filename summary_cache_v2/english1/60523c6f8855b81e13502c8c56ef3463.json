{"summary": "This module implements a reference Sampler primitive for Qiskit, capable of executing quantum circuits and delivering measurement outcomes either as exact probability distributions or as stochastic shot‑based samples, with configurable shot counts and optional deterministic seeding, while integrating with Qiskit’s job and result handling mechanisms.", "business_intent": "Provide a reliable, backend‑agnostic sampler that serves as a baseline for testing, benchmarking, and fallback execution when hardware or advanced simulators are unavailable, ensuring consistent and reproducible sampling of circuit measurement results within the Qiskit ecosystem.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "Sampler", "quantum circuit", "measurement sampling", "shots", "probability distribution", "deterministic seeding", "reference implementation", "primitive", "simulation"], "summary_hash": "7987afaad779", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:03:11+00:00"}
