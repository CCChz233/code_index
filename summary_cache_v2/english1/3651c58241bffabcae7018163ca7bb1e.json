{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests and supporting helper utilities for the other adult cancers simulation component. It sets up various simulation configurations—such as differing initial prevalence levels, altered disease onset and progression rates, and varied treatment effectiveness—and verifies that the model correctly respects these settings, including the impact of health system integration.", "business_intent": "Validate that the adult cancer modeling framework behaves as expected across a range of epidemiological and health‑system scenarios, ensuring accurate disease progression, treatment effects, and prevalence handling.", "keywords": ["testing", "simulation", "cancer model", "prevalence", "disease progression", "treatment effectiveness", "health system integration", "configuration", "onset rate", "LGD"], "summary_hash": "c6f8ee9a50cc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:42:58+00:00"}
