{"summary": "Utility module that provides functions for spatially regridding MODFLOW‑6 model data (arrays, packages, and auxiliary variables) from a source grid to a target grid. It supports multiple regrid algorithms, caches regridder weight objects for reuse, validates inputs, and integrates with the model's package interfaces.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient and reliable transfer of model data between differing spatial discretizations, facilitating model coupling, grid refinement, and scenario updates within MODFLOW‑6 workflows.", "keywords": ["regrid", "grid transformation", "weight cache", "MODFLOW 6", "spatial interpolation", "xarray", "xugrid", "auxiliary variables", "package data", "grid clipping", "validation"], "summary_hash": "86a48548bd48", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:01:13+00:00"}
