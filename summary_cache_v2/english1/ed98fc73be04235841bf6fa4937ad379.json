{"summary": "A transformation that vertically flips images (and associated masks) around the x‑axis, reversing row order while keeping dimensions unchanged. It also recalculates positions of bounding boxes and keypoints to match the flipped layout, and can be applied with a configurable probability.", "business_intent": "Enhance computer‑vision training datasets through vertical flip augmentation, increasing model robustness to orientation variations by providing altered image and annotation samples.", "keywords": ["vertical flip", "image augmentation", "data augmentation", "bounding box adjustment", "keypoint transformation", "probability", "computer vision", "image processing", "flip transformation"], "summary_hash": "ca7bcdbb7a89", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:25:34+00:00"}
