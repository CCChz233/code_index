{"summary": "A container class that aggregates multiple pinhole camera instances into a single batched representation. It inherits all properties of a single pinhole camera while adding an extra dimension so that intrinsic and extrinsic tensors are stacked across the camera list, enabling collective operations on a set of cameras.", "business_intent": "Simplify multi‑camera workflows in computer‑vision applications by providing a unified, batch‑compatible interface for handling, initializing, and querying a collection of pinhole cameras.", "keywords": ["pinhole camera", "batch", "camera list", "tensor stacking", "computer vision", "multi-camera", "initialization", "getter", "camera count"], "summary_hash": "396df37ff63c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:03:51+00:00"}
