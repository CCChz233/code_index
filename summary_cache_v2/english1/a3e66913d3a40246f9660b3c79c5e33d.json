{"summary": "This collection of scripts implements end‑to‑end pipelines for training and evaluating latent consistency model (LCM) distillation of Stable Diffusion and Stable Diffusion XL. The pipelines load pretrained diffusion checkpoints, inject LoRA adapters, stream large text‑to‑image datasets via WebDataset, set up DDIM/LCM samplers, compute consistency losses, update LoRA weights with EMA, and manage distributed training, logging, validation, checkpointing and optional model upload. A test suite validates that the LCM‑LoRA pipeline can load a model, run inference, and handle checkpoints correctly.", "business_intent": "Provide a practical, scalable solution for compressing large diffusion models into fast, few‑step generators, enabling rapid text‑to‑image generation in production or research environments while preserving quality, and offering a LoRA‑based fine‑tuning path for easy model customization.", "keywords": ["latent consistency models", "distillation", "LoRA", "Stable Diffusion", "Stable Diffusion XL", "WebDataset", "Accelerate", "DDIM sampler", "EMA", "distributed training", "text-to-image generation", "checkpointing", "validation"], "summary_hash": "0bb368222c83", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:37:18+00:00"}
