{"summary": "Implements a graph attention convolution layer that aggregates neighbor node features using learned attention coefficients, supporting multi‑head attention, optional feature and attention dropout, residual connections, activation functions, and configurable handling of zero‑in‑degree nodes. Works for both homogeneous and unidirectional bipartite graphs.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable neural network component for Graph Attention Networks, allowing models to compute expressive node embeddings through attention‑based message passing on graph data.", "keywords": ["graph attention", "GAT", "convolution", "multi‑head attention", "dropout", "residual connection", "activation", "zero‑in‑degree handling", "homogeneous graph", "bipartite graph", "message passing"], "summary_hash": "5e1bac744f0c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:53:37+00:00"}
