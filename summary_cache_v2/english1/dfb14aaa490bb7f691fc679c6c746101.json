{"summary": "The module provides utilities for generating scalar schedules that modulate the learning rate during training of diffusion models. It includes a simple linear progression, a warm‑up followed by cosine decay, and an extended version supporting repeated cosine cycles.", "business_intent": "Enable stable and efficient training of diffusion‑based generative models by supplying flexible learning‑rate scaling strategies that improve convergence and performance.", "keywords": ["learning rate scheduler", "linear schedule", "warmup", "cosine decay", "cyclical schedule", "diffusion model training", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "e76930ae154e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:00:31+00:00"}
