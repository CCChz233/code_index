{"summary": "Provides utilities to compile Cython source snippets at runtime, turning them into callable Python functions. It manages a compilation context, caches generated extensions, resolves unbound identifiers, and handles code preprocessing such as indentation stripping and type safety checks.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to embed high‑performance Cython code directly within Python programs without a separate build step, accelerating performance‑critical sections while preserving the flexibility of dynamic execution.", "keywords": ["Cython", "runtime compilation", "dynamic function generation", "caching", "code preprocessing", "unbound symbol analysis", "extension building", "type safety", "performance optimization", "inline code execution"], "summary_hash": "eab31fc3731d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:26:11+00:00"}
