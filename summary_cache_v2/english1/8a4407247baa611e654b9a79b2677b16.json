{"summary": "This module defines a class that encapsulates the configuration of recharge boundary conditions for MODFLOW‑6 groundwater flow models. It allows users to specify spatially distributed recharge fluxes, optional solute concentrations for coupled transport simulations, and various output and budgeting options. The implementation supports temporal repetition of stress data, handling of inactive cells, regridding of input data, and validation of parameters against predefined schemas.", "business_intent": "Provide modelers with a flexible, validated interface to define and manage recharge inputs and related transport data in MODFLOW‑6 simulations, ensuring accurate representation of recharge processes and facilitating downstream analysis such as budgeting and output generation.", "keywords": ["recharge", "MODFLOW-6", "groundwater modeling", "boundary condition", "flux distribution", "solute concentration", "transport coupling", "budgeting", "temporal stress periods", "regridding", "input validation", "spatial mapping"], "summary_hash": "0993defbb1f7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:48:31+00:00"}
