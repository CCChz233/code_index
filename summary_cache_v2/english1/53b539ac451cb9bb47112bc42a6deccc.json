{"summary": "The module defines a generic layer abstraction for quantum circuits and concrete implementations for single‑qubit and two‑qubit gate layers. Each layer stores its local gate matrix and embeds it into the full system operator by tensoring with identities on the remaining qubits, supporting retrieval and modification of the gate data for use in fast gradient‑based unitary synthesis.", "business_intent": "Enable modular, gradient‑compatible representation of quantum circuit layers to support efficient synthesis and optimization of target unitaries within the Qiskit framework.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "layer abstraction", "single-qubit gate", "two-qubit gate", "tensor product", "identity matrix", "fast gradient", "unitary synthesis", "Qiskit", "abstract base class"], "summary_hash": "5270eaf52d8c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:00:57+00:00"}
