{"summary": "This test module validates the MONAI transform that converts arbitrary class identifiers into sequential numeric indices. It generates synthetic label data, applies the mapping, and asserts correct output across multiple NumPy-like array types, including edge cases and error conditions.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that class-to-index mapping works reliably in preprocessing pipelines for medical imaging, preventing regressions and ensuring compatibility with different array implementations.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "MONAI", "class mapping", "indices", "numpy", "parameterized", "ndarray", "validation", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "8461b5f5f223", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:38:39+00:00"}
