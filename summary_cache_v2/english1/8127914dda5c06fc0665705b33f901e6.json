{"summary": "Implements a Conformer‑based neural model that fine‑tunes a pretrained self‑supervised speech encoder to produce separate linguistic content and speaker identity embeddings. The model is trained jointly for automatic speech recognition and speaker verification, and the resulting disentangled embeddings can be swapped to drive voice conversion in downstream FastPitch TTS pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑quality, flexible text‑to‑speech solutions that support voice conversion, speaker adaptation, and improved synthesis by leveraging self‑supervised speech representations and disentangled embeddings.", "keywords": ["self‑supervised learning", "speech disentanglement", "Conformer", "content embedding", "speaker embedding", "voice conversion", "FastPitch", "speech recognition", "speaker verification", "text‑to‑speech", "multi‑task learning"], "summary_hash": "0fb71a6fb276", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:56:53+00:00"}
