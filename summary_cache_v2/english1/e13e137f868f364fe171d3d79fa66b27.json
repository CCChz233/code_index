{"summary": "Evaluates a sentence embedding model's ability to discover paraphrase (duplicate) pairs within a large collection of sentences. It mines candidate pairs based on similarity, matches them against a reference set of known duplicates, and reports ranking and classification metrics such as average precision, precision, recall, optimal similarity threshold, and F1 score.", "business_intent": "Provides a quantitative assessment of embedding models for duplicate detection and paraphrase mining, enabling developers and researchers to benchmark, tune, and select models that best capture semantic similarity for applications like question answering, content deduplication, and information retrieval.", "keywords": ["paraphrase mining", "duplicate detection", "sentence embeddings", "evaluation", "average precision", "precision", "recall", "F1 score", "similarity threshold", "benchmarking", "semantic similarity"], "summary_hash": "9eef677693a0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:47:17+00:00"}
