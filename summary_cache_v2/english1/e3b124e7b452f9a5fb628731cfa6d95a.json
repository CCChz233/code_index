{"summary": "Provides a local, asynchronous scheduler that coordinates workers to execute Dask task graphs in parallel while minimizing memory usage. It defines execution state, task selection policies, and executor backends (process‑pool and synchronous) and includes utilities for task submission, result handling, and data release.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient, parallel computation of Dask graphs on a single machine, offering both multiprocessing and synchronous execution modes and optimizing memory footprint for large or out‑of‑core workloads.", "keywords": ["scheduler", "task graph", "parallel execution", "shared memory", "executor", "multiprocessing", "synchronous", "memory management", "task selection", "inlining", "Dask", "futures", "queue"], "summary_hash": "6b97a950260c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:15:32+00:00"}
