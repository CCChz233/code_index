{"summary": "A configuration container for the BigBird transformer model that holds all architectural hyperparameters such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, dropout rates, positional limits, and specialized block‑sparse attention settings. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate a BigBird model with the desired encoder/decoder behavior.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to easily define, customize, and reproduce BigBird model architectures for natural‑language processing tasks, facilitating model creation, fine‑tuning, and deployment with consistent settings.", "keywords": ["BigBird", "Transformer", "model configuration", "hyperparameters", "block sparse attention", "encoder", "decoder", "dropout", "vocab size", "hidden size", "pretrained"], "summary_hash": "8a1625774c66", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:46:52+00:00"}
