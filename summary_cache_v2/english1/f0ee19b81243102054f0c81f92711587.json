{"summary": "A suite of unit tests that validate the behavior of GPU‑accelerated Fast Fourier Transform operations exposed through CuPy's SciPy compatibility layer. The tests cover correctness, plan management, and memory‑layout handling for one‑, two‑, and multi‑dimensional transforms, including real‑valued cases and view objects.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability and performance of CuPy's SciPy FFT functions on GPUs by detecting regressions and ensuring they produce accurate results across diverse input configurations and memory layouts.", "keywords": ["CuPy", "SciPy", "FFT", "GPU", "unit testing", "correctness", "plan handling", "memory layout", "multidimensional", "real-valued transform", "view objects"], "summary_hash": "29da581ce32c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:37:15+00:00"}
