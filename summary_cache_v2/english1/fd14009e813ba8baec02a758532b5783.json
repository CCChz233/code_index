{"summary": "A pipeline component that takes a collection of callable transformations and applies them to input data in a randomly shuffled sequence. It supports per‑item mapping for iterable inputs, optional argument unpacking, configurable logging, lazy execution to minimize resampling, and runtime overrides of common transform parameters.", "business_intent": "To provide a flexible, stochastic augmentation framework for machine‑learning or data‑processing workflows, increasing data variability and simplifying the construction of complex, configurable transformation pipelines.", "keywords": ["randomized transformation order", "pipeline composition", "data augmentation", "lazy execution", "parameter overrides", "logging integration", "per‑item mapping", "argument unpacking"], "summary_hash": "d06d0e495a55", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:05:55+00:00"}
