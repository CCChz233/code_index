{"summary": "Applies post‑processing to a predicted probability map to produce a refined label map. The class thresholds pixel probabilities, discards objects smaller than a given size, fills or removes holes below a size threshold, optionally performs morphological reconstruction, and generates an instance map for specified predicted classes.", "business_intent": "Clean and standardize segmentation predictions so they can be reliably used in downstream medical imaging or computer‑vision workflows.", "keywords": ["segmentation", "post‑processing", "thresholding", "small object removal", "hole filling", "morphological reconstruction", "instance map", "label filtering", "probability map"], "summary_hash": "6f4bf19c01b1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:11:00+00:00"}
