{"summary": "The raster_source package defines a hierarchy of raster source abstractions and their configuration builders for geospatial machine‑learning pipelines. It includes default providers, GeoTIFF handling with Rasterio and VRT support, generic image sources with automatic remote download, a rasterio‑based backend exposing spatial metadata, and a rasterized source that converts vector geometries into mask arrays. All sources support activation, sub‑region extraction, CRS transformation, protobuf serialization, and bundling of required files.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to seamlessly ingest, transform, and manage diverse raster datasets (satellite imagery, maps, vector masks) within Raster Vision workflows, simplifying training and inference of geospatial computer‑vision models.", "keywords": ["raster source", "GeoTIFF", "rasterio", "image source", "rasterized source", "configuration", "CRS transformation", "remote download", "VRT", "machine learning", "geospatial data pipeline"], "summary_hash": "6c376df8070f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:05:07+00:00"}
