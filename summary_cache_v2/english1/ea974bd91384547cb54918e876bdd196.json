It takes many components: text encoder, tokenizer, scheduler, UNet, VQ model, prior transformer, prior image encoder, prior text encoder, prior tokenizer, prior scheduler. So it's a pipeline that does image-to-image generation using text prompts and possibly image inputs, using Kandinsky model (a diffusion model). It combines prior (unCLIP) to get image embedding from text, then uses UNet to denoise latents conditioned on image embedding, then decodes with VQ model.
