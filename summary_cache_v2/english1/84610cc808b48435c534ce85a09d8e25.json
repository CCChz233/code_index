{"summary": "Implements a variational autoencoder that encodes images into a latent distribution with KL regularization and decodes latents back to images, applying a scaling factor to normalize the latent space for diffusion models. The architecture is configurable (channels, activation, block sizes) and includes utilities for tiled, framewise, and gradient‑checkpointed processing.", "business_intent": "Provide a trainable encoder‑decoder component for the Mochi image synthesis pipeline, delivering normalized latent representations that can be consumed by diffusion models for high‑resolution image generation, compression, and manipulation.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "KL loss", "latent encoding", "image decoding", "scaling factor", "diffusion model integration", "Mochi", "high‑resolution synthesis", "tiled processing", "framewise decoding", "gradient checkpointing"], "summary_hash": "d464b8b7a2f9", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:34:15+00:00"}
