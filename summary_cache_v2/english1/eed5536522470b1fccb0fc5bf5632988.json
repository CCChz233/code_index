{"summary": "The class implements a global RX rotation gate that applies the same X‑axis rotation by angle θ to every qubit in the register simultaneously. For a single qubit it behaves like the standard RX gate, while for multiple qubits it represents the direct sum of individual RX operations, matching the native collective‑rotation capabilities of ion‑trap and neutral‑atom hardware.", "business_intent": "Provide a hardware‑aware, high‑level abstraction for executing collective X‑rotations across all qubits in a circuit, reducing gate count and improving performance on platforms that support native global RX operations.", "keywords": ["global RX", "collective rotation", "multi‑qubit gate", "ion trap", "neutral atom", "quantum circuit", "RX gate", "theta parameter", "native hardware gate"], "summary_hash": "642f67faba77", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:35:24+00:00"}
