{"summary": "Implements a graph attention convolution layer that aggregates neighbor features using learnable attention coefficients, supporting multi‑head attention, optional dropout, residual connections, activation, and bias. Works for both homogeneous and unidirectional bipartite graphs and includes handling for zero‑in‑degree nodes.", "business_intent": "Provide a neural network component that computes expressive node representations on graph-structured data using the Graph Attention Network mechanism, facilitating deep learning on graphs within the DGL ecosystem.", "keywords": ["graph attention", "GAT", "convolution", "multi-head attention", "dropout", "residual connection", "activation", "bias", "zero in-degree handling", "homogeneous graph", "bipartite graph", "message passing", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "c70218c125fa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:56:43+00:00"}
