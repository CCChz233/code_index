{"summary": "The module implements a comprehensive benchmarking framework for MPAS‑Ocean datasets using the uxarray library. It supplies reusable components to set up and tear down datasets, grids, and dual meshes, construct mesh connectivity and spatial trees, compute geometric properties such as face coordinates and cross‑sections, perform remapping, zonal averaging, and visual conversion, and capture performance metrics like execution time, memory usage, and gradients.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and scientists to measure, compare, and optimise the performance of uxarray operations on ocean model data, supporting scalability assessments and workflow improvements for high‑resolution MPAS‑Ocean simulations.", "keywords": ["uxarray", "MPAS-Ocean", "benchmarking", "performance profiling", "mesh connectivity", "dual mesh", "cross‑section analysis", "spatial tree", "remap downsample", "remap upsample", "zonal average", "gradient analysis", "memory consumption", "execution time", "geospatial dataframe", "visualisation"], "summary_hash": "821cd95d8861", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:23:50+00:00"}
