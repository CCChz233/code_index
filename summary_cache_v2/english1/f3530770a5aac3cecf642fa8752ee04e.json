{"summary": "A placeholder component that can be inserted into a lazily executed pipeline to force immediate evaluation, ensuring any pending resampling occurs before the next transform. The class itself performs no operation; its presence breaks the lazy chain because it does not implement the LazyTrait.", "business_intent": "Enforce correct ordering of resampling steps within lazy data‑processing pipelines, preventing downstream transforms from operating on data that has not been resampled.", "keywords": ["pipeline", "lazy execution", "resampling", "placeholder", "execution trigger", "Compose", "transform", "LazyTrait"], "summary_hash": "8de3665d3907", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:55:52+00:00"}
