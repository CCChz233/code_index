{"summary": "Implements a Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation (PNA) convolution layer for graph neural networks. The layer splits node features across several parallel towers, each performing message passing with configurable aggregators (e.g., mean, max, sum, moments) and degree‑dependent scalers, then concatenates the tower outputs and mixes them linearly, optionally adding a residual connection.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible and powerful graph convolution operator that captures diverse neighborhood statistics and adapts to varying node degrees, enabling more accurate representation learning on graphs with heterogeneous structures.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "PNA", "aggregation", "scalers", "message passing", "towers", "residual connection", "dropout", "edge features"], "summary_hash": "42bc18ff42d9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:54:36+00:00"}
