{"summary": "The module ingests live flight telemetry, fits a trajectory curve to the data, and continuously estimates the rocket’s maximum altitude (apogee). It supplies the predicted apogee to downstream components such as servo actuators, while handling execution state, inter‑process communication queues, and convergence of the prediction model via lookup tables and curve‑fit coefficients.", "business_intent": "Enable real‑time apogee estimation to trigger timely control actions (e.g., servo deployment) and improve flight safety and performance for rocket launches.", "keywords": ["apogee prediction", "telemetry processing", "curve fitting", "trajectory model", "rocket flight", "servo actuation", "real-time estimation", "lookup table", "launch velocity", "data queues", "flight control"], "summary_hash": "e0bf39955bf6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:27:59+00:00"}
