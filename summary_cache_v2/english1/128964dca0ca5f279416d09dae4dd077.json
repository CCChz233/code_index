{"summary": "Implements a high‑performance tokenizer for the REALM model, performing full preprocessing—including punctuation splitting, optional lower‑casing, accent stripping, Chinese character handling, and WordPiece subword segmentation—by leveraging the HuggingFace tokenizers library. It manages special tokens (CLS, SEP, PAD, MASK, UNK), builds input sequences with appropriate token type IDs, and supports batch encoding of candidate texts.", "business_intent": "Provide fast, reliable text preprocessing for retrieval‑augmented language models, enabling scalable training and inference in applications such as question answering, document retrieval, and text classification.", "keywords": ["REALM", "fast tokenizer", "WordPiece", "HuggingFace tokenizers", "special tokens", "text preprocessing", "batch encoding", "token type IDs", "vocabulary management"], "summary_hash": "be8bda20ea75", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:10:31+00:00"}
