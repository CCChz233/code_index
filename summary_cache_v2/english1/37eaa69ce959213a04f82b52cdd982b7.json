{"summary": "HAL-CGP is a pure‑Python library that implements Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). It provides data structures for CGP genomes, mutation operators, and a mu + lambda evolutionary strategy, and can translate CGP genotypes into executable phenotypes such as plain Python functions, NumPy‑compatible functions, SymPy expressions, or PyTorch modules.", "business_intent": "Offer researchers and developers a flexible, extensible toolkit for applying CGP to problems with costly fitness evaluations, enabling symbolic regression, function discovery, and other optimization tasks across multiple computational back‑ends.", "keywords": ["Cartesian Genetic Programming", "CGP", "evolutionary algorithms", "mu+lambda strategy", "symbolic regression", "Python library", "NumPy integration", "SymPy integration", "PyTorch integration", "genetic programming"], "summary_hash": "b6d1c97ba120", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:46:13+00:00"}
