{"summary": "The script serves as the entry point for the multimodal X‑to‑NeRF example. It parses a Hydra configuration, sets up experiment logging and management, seeds the random number generators, instantiates the model and data pipeline via NeMo utilities, creates a PyTorch Lightning Trainer, and launches training or evaluation based on the provided configuration.", "business_intent": "Enable users to train and evaluate a neural radiance field model that integrates multiple data modalities, leveraging the NeMo framework for reproducible experiments and scalable training.", "keywords": ["Hydra", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "NeRF", "multimodal", "training", "experiment management", "configuration", "seed", "logging"], "summary_hash": "81724d511d95", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:36:33+00:00"}
