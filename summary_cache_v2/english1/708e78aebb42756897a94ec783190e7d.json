{"summary": "A test suite that validates the behavior of the plasma physics utility decorators responsible for checking objects (units, values, relativistic conditions). It exercises the base checking class, unit‑checking decorator, value‑checking decorator, and relativistic checks, covering annotations, defaults, method‑level specifications, equivalencies, signature preservation, inheritance, and appropriate error/warning handling.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the validation decorators used throughout the PlasmaPy codebase correctly enforce scientific constraints without altering function behavior, thereby guaranteeing reliable and accurate computations in plasma physics applications.", "keywords": ["testing", "decorators", "validation", "units", "values", "relativistic", "plasma physics", "pytest", "astropy", "error handling", "inheritance", "function signatures"], "summary_hash": "a34586ad3072", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:06:58+00:00"}
