{"summary": "A comprehensive test suite that validates the core functionality of a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) framework, covering various trainer implementations (alignment propagation, BCO, CPO, DDPO, DPO, GKD, KTO, NashMD, ORPO, PPO, RLOO, SFT, XPO), data collators, utility functions, model wrappers, callbacks, CLI execution, and statistical helpers. The tests ensure correct loss computation, sample generation, LoRA and PEFT integration, configuration handling, token processing, and evaluation across causal and seq2seq models.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability, correctness, and robustness of the RLHF training infrastructure for language models, enabling safe deployment and easier maintenance of fine‑tuning pipelines.", "keywords": ["testing", "RLHF", "trainer validation", "preference optimization", "LoRA", "PEFT", "model wrappers", "callbacks", "CLI testing", "data utilities", "tokenization", "generation", "evaluation", "statistical utilities"], "summary_hash": "ee2990a5de72", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:02:57+00:00"}
