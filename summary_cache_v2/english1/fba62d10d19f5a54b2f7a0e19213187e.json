{"summary": "The package provides a complete example of using a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) with MXNet and DGL to perform entity classification on multi‑relational graph datasets. It includes a Gluon‑based RGCN model definition with configurable layers and basis decomposition, as well as a script that loads benchmark datasets, builds the model, runs a training loop with L2 regularization, and reports classification accuracy.", "business_intent": "Showcase how to implement and evaluate RGCN‑based entity classification in a production‑ready MXNet environment, offering a reference implementation for developers and researchers building graph neural network solutions for knowledge‑graph tasks.", "keywords": ["RGCN", "relational graph convolutional network", "entity classification", "MXNet", "DGL", "graph neural network", "knowledge graph", "multi‑relational data", "benchmark datasets", "training loop", "L2 regularization"], "summary_hash": "51ce36005e4a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:50:20+00:00"}
