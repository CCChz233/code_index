{"summary": "The module is an illustrative example that applies Cartesian Genetic Programming to solve the MountainCarContinuous environment from OpenAI Gym. It defines reusable numeric constants, sets up evolutionary helpers, runs the CGP evolution loop, evaluates performance, and provides plotting and visualization utilities to observe fitness progression and agent behavior.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate how evolutionary computation, specifically Cartesian Genetic Programming, can be employed for continuous control problems, serving as an educational reference for developers and researchers interested in reinforcement learning and algorithmic optimization within simulated environments.", "keywords": ["OpenAI Gym", "MountainCarContinuous", "Cartesian Genetic Programming", "evolutionary algorithm", "reinforcement learning", "continuous control", "simulation", "fitness plotting", "behavior visualization", "constant values"], "summary_hash": "d09e2dc63479", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:44:56+00:00"}
