{"summary": "This module contains unit tests that verify the behavior of the SPADE AutoEncoder with KL regularization. The tests check that the model correctly handles different channel configurations, produces tensors of expected shapes during encoding, decoding, and sampling, and works both with and without the attention mechanism.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and robustness of the SPADE AutoEncoder KL implementation to ensure reliable performance in medical imaging pipelines and maintain code quality through automated testing.", "keywords": ["SPADE", "AutoEncoderKL", "unit test", "PyTorch", "MONAI", "attention", "encoding", "decoding", "sampling", "tensor shapes", "channel configuration"], "summary_hash": "6d995b18d854", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:37:43+00:00"}
