{"summary": "AbstractMesh is a lightweight, device‑agnostic representation of a mesh topology that stores only axis names and their sizes. It supplies helper properties and utilities for querying mesh characteristics (e.g., shape, size, device lists) and integrates with JAX sharding APIs to avoid recompilation when the underlying devices change while the mesh layout remains constant.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient reuse of compiled JAX programs by providing a stable mesh descriptor that decouples logical sharding structure from physical device assignments, thereby reducing tracing overhead and cache misses during distributed computation.", "keywords": ["mesh", "axis names", "axis sizes", "JAX", "sharding", "device‑agnostic", "compilation cache", "tracing", "distributed computing", "helper utilities"], "summary_hash": "9df13f59d8fc", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:25:33+00:00"}
