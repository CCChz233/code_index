{"summary": "The module defines the configuration and implementation of a multilingual CLIP model used as the text encoder in the Kandinsky diffusion pipeline. It provides a structured configuration object for specifying architecture and pretrained weights, and a model class that leverages XLM‑Roberta to generate joint image‑text embeddings for cross‑modal tasks.", "business_intent": "To enable the Kandinsky image generation system to accept and understand text inputs in multiple languages, thereby broadening its market reach and improving the quality of text‑driven image synthesis.", "keywords": ["multilingual", "CLIP", "text encoder", "configuration", "XLM-Roberta", "cross-modal embeddings", "Kandinsky", "diffusion pipeline", "torch", "pretrained model"], "summary_hash": "b2c80d77a95c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:26:05+00:00"}
