{"summary": "The module implements the Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) algorithm for unsupervised graph representation learning using TensorFlow and DGL. It defines components for encoding graph structures, discriminating between local and global representations, and a classifier for downstream tasks. It provides a lightweight wrapper to run the DGI training step.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready-to-use example of unsupervised graph embedding learning that can be integrated into applications requiring node classification, link prediction, or other graph analytics, facilitating research and development of graph neural networks.", "keywords": ["deep graph infomax", "graph representation learning", "unsupervised", "TensorFlow", "DGL", "graph neural network", "encoder", "discriminator", "classifier", "GCN"], "summary_hash": "56b34a228a96", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:51:06+00:00"}
