{"summary": "Provides utilities for parsing and generating iMOD .gen files, supporting both ASCII and Fortran unformatted binary representations of geometric objects such as points, lines, polygons, circles and rectangles. Includes a custom Fortran file wrapper for handling character records and helper routines to translate between internal data structures and the .gen specification.", "business_intent": "Facilitate exchange of geological model geometry data between iMOD and other software by reading existing .gen files and writing new ones, enabling downstream analysis, visualization, and model construction.", "keywords": ["iMOD", "GEN", "geometry", "file I/O", "ASCII", "binary", "Fortran unformatted", "shapes", "points", "lines", "polygons", "circles", "rectangles", "data conversion"], "summary_hash": "0002a1296571", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:50:28+00:00"}
