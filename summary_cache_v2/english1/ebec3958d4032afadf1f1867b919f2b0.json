{"summary": "The module supplies PyTorch Lightning plugins tailored for NeMo Megatron‑style models. One plugin determines appropriate global and micro‑batch sizes, adapts data loaders, and coordinates sampling across distributed processes. The other plugin implements automatic mixed‑precision handling, converting tensors, model parameters, and optimizer states to low‑precision formats, managing scaling contexts, and ensuring stable optimizer updates.", "business_intent": "Facilitate high‑performance, memory‑efficient training of large language models by automating batch configuration and mixed‑precision execution in distributed environments.", "keywords": ["data sampling", "batch sizing", "distributed training", "Megatron-LM", "PyTorch Lightning plugin", "mixed precision", "FP16", "BF16", "gradient scaling", "optimizer state conversion", "NeMo", "large language models"], "summary_hash": "2b9b385f49ee", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:00:36+00:00"}
