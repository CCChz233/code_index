{"summary": "This module implements a handler that computes the Hausdorff distance between full-size prediction and ground‑truth tensors during model training or evaluation. It integrates with the Ignite engine, leverages MONAI's Hausdorff distance metric, and aggregates the metric by averaging over the batch dimension, class channels, and multiple iterations.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable evaluation of segmentation models—particularly in medical imaging—by providing a ready‑to‑use metric that quantifies boundary errors through the Hausdorff distance, facilitating model validation and performance monitoring.", "keywords": ["Hausdorff distance", "segmentation evaluation", "metric handler", "MONAI", "Ignite integration", "batch aggregation", "class channel averaging", "medical imaging", "model validation"], "summary_hash": "fc4fe3dba234", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:10:19+00:00"}
