{"summary": "This module defines automated tests for the Kandinsky‑3 image‑to‑image generation pipeline. It includes a fast test suite that uses lightweight dummy components to quickly verify core behaviors such as mixed‑precision support, batch versus single inference, and output consistency, as well as an integration test suite that runs the full pipeline with the actual model to confirm end‑to‑end functionality and proper resource cleanup.", "business_intent": "Validate and guarantee the correctness and stability of the Kandinsky‑3 image‑to‑image generation service, enabling reliable deployment of AI‑driven image creation features in products.", "keywords": ["Kandinsky-3", "image-to-image", "pipeline testing", "unit tests", "integration tests", "dummy components", "float16", "batch processing", "output verification", "diffusers", "transformers", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "4f0097219883", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:53:35+00:00"}
