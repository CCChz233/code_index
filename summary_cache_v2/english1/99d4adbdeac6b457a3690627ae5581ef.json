{"summary": "A collection of helper utilities that support hardware‑accelerated execution and type handling in NeMo. It includes wrappers for CUDA‑Python integration (driver checks, NVRTC compilation, conditional GPU execution), tools for inspecting and unpacking NeuralType specifications (dynamic axes and I/O mappings), and Numba compatibility helpers (CPU/CUDA support detection, strict mode management, and test skipping).", "business_intent": "Enable seamless and safe use of GPU and JIT‑compiled code paths while providing introspection of neural type metadata, thereby improving portability, performance, and developer productivity across diverse hardware environments.", "keywords": ["CUDA", "Numba", "NeuralType", "GPU", "compatibility", "context manager", "dynamic axis", "NVRTC", "driver version", "conditional execution", "utility"], "summary_hash": "35d3752e3936", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:12:14+00:00"}
