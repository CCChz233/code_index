{"summary": "The module defines a Mixer‑TTS model class that transforms textual input into mel‑spectrograms using language‑model embeddings, tokenizers, and alignment mechanisms. It manages model setup, data preprocessing, forward passes for training, validation, and inference, and supports exporting the model for deployment.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to generate natural‑sounding speech from text across languages, facilitating integration of neural TTS capabilities into products, services, and experiments.", "keywords": ["text-to-speech", "Mixer-TTS", "mel spectrogram", "neural synthesis", "tokenization", "language model embeddings", "training", "inference", "model export", "PyTorch", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "7144fbd50132", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:56:59+00:00"}
