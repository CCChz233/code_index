{"summary": "A collection of tutorial examples that demonstrate how to wrap and call functions from the C standard library using Cython. The examples cover converting C strings to Python integers, invoking C functions with keyword arguments, and accessing mathematical functions such as sine from libc, illustrating the process of creating lightweight Python helpers for external C code.", "business_intent": "Educate developers on integrating C libraries into Python projects via Cython to improve performance, reuse existing C code, and simplify the creation of Python-accessible wrappers for native functions.", "keywords": ["Cython", "C library integration", "Python wrapper", "atoi", "libc", "sine function", "keyword arguments", "tutorial", "example code", "native extension"], "summary_hash": "0e1813da1c95", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:31:46+00:00"}
