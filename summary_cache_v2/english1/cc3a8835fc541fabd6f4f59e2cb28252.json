{"summary": "This module implements a latent‑diffusion based super‑resolution pipeline. It encodes a low‑resolution image into a latent space using a vector‑quantized model, iteratively denoises the latent representation with a UNet guided by a selectable scheduler, and decodes the refined latent back into a higher‑resolution image. A small preprocessing helper prepares input images for the pipeline.", "business_intent": "Provide an AI‑driven solution for upscaling images, enabling higher‑quality visual content in media production, e‑commerce, gaming, and other domains that require enhanced image resolution.", "keywords": ["latent diffusion", "super resolution", "image upscaling", "vector quantized model", "UNet denoiser", "diffusion scheduler", "high‑resolution generation", "AI image enhancement"], "summary_hash": "caaef03bfb34", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:19:56+00:00"}
