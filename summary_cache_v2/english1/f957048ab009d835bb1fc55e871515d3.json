{"summary": "Provides a collection of test fixtures that emulate the abstract fsspec fixtures but are adapted for DVC's read‑only filesystem. It supplies pre‑configured DVCFileSystem instances, path objects and mock behaviours (e.g., ignoring .gitignore) to simulate directories, files, bulk operations, glob edge cases, and path joining for both DVC and local filesystems.", "business_intent": "Facilitate reliable unit and integration testing of DVCFileSystem operations without needing to create real files or directories, by offering reusable, mocked fixtures that represent common filesystem scenarios.", "keywords": ["DVCFileSystem", "test fixtures", "fsspec compatibility", "read‑only filesystem", "mock ignore", "filesystem paths", "bulk operations", "glob edge cases", "path joining", "local filesystem"], "summary_hash": "91a2e152b0ef", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:58:38+00:00"}
