{"summary": "A compiler transform that scans the abstract syntax tree for Cython compiler directives originating from comments, command‑line arguments, decorators, and with‑statements, resolves their values (using defaults from Options), and records them both globally on the module node and locally via a CompilerDirectivesNode for sub‑trees. It also replaces the special cython.compiled flag with a true Boolean node to enable early dead‑code removal before type analysis.", "business_intent": "Ensure that user‑specified compilation directives are correctly interpreted and applied throughout the compilation pipeline, providing fine‑grained control over Cython's behavior and enabling early optimizations such as unreachable‑code elimination.", "keywords": ["Cython", "compiler directives", "AST transformation", "global directive storage", "local directive overrides", "early optimization", "dead code removal", "cimport tracking", "directive parsing"], "summary_hash": "bb21fdd5be0f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:51:23+00:00"}
