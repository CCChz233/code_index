{"summary": "Represents a classical variable used in quantum circuits, encapsulating either an owned storage location with a name or a reference to an existing classical bit or register. Instances are immutable and hashable, allowing them to serve as reliable identifiers in mappings.", "business_intent": "Enable consistent creation and management of classical data elements within quantum programs, supporting both newly allocated variables and wrappers around pre‑existing classical resources, while ensuring immutability for safe reuse as keys.", "keywords": ["classical variable", "immutable", "hashable", "quantum circuit", "storage ownership", "named variable", "bit wrapper", "register reference", "identifier", "dictionary key"], "summary_hash": "ecac99717ea5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:39:00+00:00"}
