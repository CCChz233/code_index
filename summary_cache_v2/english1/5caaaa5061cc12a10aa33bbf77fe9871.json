{"summary": "Implements a logger that connects PyTorch Lightning training runs with the Weights & Biases platform. It creates and configures a W&B run, records metrics, hyperparameters, model graphs, gradients, and various media types, and automatically logs checkpoint artifacts. The logger supports both online and offline operation and provides utilities for artifact download and run configuration management.", "business_intent": "Facilitate experiment tracking, visualization, and reproducibility for machine‑learning teams by seamlessly integrating Lightning training workflows with the Weights & Biases ecosystem.", "keywords": ["weights & biases", "experiment tracking", "pytorch lightning", "logger", "metrics", "hyperparameters", "model topology", "gradients", "media logging", "checkpoint artifacts", "offline mode"], "summary_hash": "23ee31f8fdfc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:57:20+00:00"}
