{"summary": "A dataset class that streams audio recordings stored in tar archives, using a JSON manifest to locate each file and its transcript. It tokenizes the transcripts with a BPE or WordPiece tokenizer, applies optional duration filtering, silence trimming, and start/end token insertion, and supports configurable shuffling and padding. The class also manages shard distribution across multiple workers for distributed training, offering scatter or replicate strategies and handling global rank and world size.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, scalable loading of large speech corpora for training automatic speech recognition models, reducing I/O overhead and simplifying distributed data handling.", "keywords": ["tarred audio", "manifest", "speech recognition", "BPE tokenizer", "duration filtering", "silence trimming", "shard strategy", "distributed training", "padding", "shuffle"], "summary_hash": "dfc10fc680e3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:49:22+00:00"}
