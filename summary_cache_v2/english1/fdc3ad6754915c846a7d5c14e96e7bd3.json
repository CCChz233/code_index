{"summary": "A toolbox of general‑purpose helper routines supporting the transformer‑lens library. It includes functions for loading and preparing datasets, tokenizing text, computing language‑model metrics such as accuracy and cross‑entropy loss, managing Hugging‑Face caches, printing GPU memory usage, and performing common tensor manipulations (e.g., fast GELU, transposition, flexible slicing). The module also defines a lightweight class that abstracts various slicing specifications for tensors.", "business_intent": "To streamline research and experimentation with transformer models by providing reusable utilities for data acquisition, preprocessing, evaluation, and low‑level tensor handling, thereby reducing boilerplate code and simplifying interaction with Hugging‑Face resources and PyTorch.", "keywords": ["utility functions", "dataset loading", "tokenization", "language model evaluation", "cross entropy", "accuracy", "GPU memory monitoring", "Hugging Face cache", "tensor slicing", "GELU activation", "PyTorch", "transformers", "numpy", "jaxtyping"], "summary_hash": "f6bf001e53c8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:21:19+00:00"}
