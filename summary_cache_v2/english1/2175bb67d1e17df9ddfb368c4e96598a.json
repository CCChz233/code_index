{"summary": "The module implements the core registry subsystem of the Feast feature‑store SDK. It defines an abstract contract for registry stores, provides concrete back‑ends (file, GCS, S3, Snowflake, SQL, remote gRPC) and a caching layer, and offers a unified Registry class that performs create, read, update, delete and list operations on all feature‑store metadata objects (feature views, entities, data sources, services, permissions, projects, etc.) while keeping the in‑memory view synchronized with the persistent backend.", "business_intent": "To give data‑science and engineering teams a reliable, backend‑agnostic way to store and manage the definitions of features, entities and related objects that power machine‑learning models, ensuring consistency, versioning and easy access across development, testing and production environments.", "keywords": ["Feast", "feature store", "registry", "metadata management", "CRUD", "backend abstraction", "caching", "protobuf", "gRPC", "SQL", "S3", "GCS", "Snowflake", "remote registry", "file storage"], "summary_hash": "c09063f53c8a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:37:40+00:00"}
