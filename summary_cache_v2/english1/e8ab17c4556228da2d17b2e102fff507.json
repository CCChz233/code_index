{"summary": "This module defines a class that implements the MODFLOW‑6 mass source loading (SRC) package. It stores solute mass addition or removal rates for each model cell, validates input data against predefined schemas, integrates with boundary condition handling, and controls how the rates are reported or saved during a simulation.", "business_intent": "Provide modelers with a reliable way to configure and manage solute mass source and sink terms in MODFLOW‑6 groundwater simulations, ensuring data integrity and flexible output handling.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW-6", "mass source loading", "SRC package", "solute transport", "groundwater modeling", "boundary condition", "cell rates", "simulation output", "data validation", "package implementation"], "summary_hash": "2142b3a19d27", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:49:04+00:00"}
