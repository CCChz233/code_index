{"summary": "The script orchestrates a graph classification workflow using DGL and PyTorch. It loads a benchmark graph dataset, applies feature engineering (degree and node label encoding), constructs a graph neural network classifier, and runs training and evaluation loops while logging performance statistics.", "business_intent": "Provide a runnable example that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a graph neural network for graph classification tasks on standard benchmark datasets.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "DGL", "graph neural network", "graph classification", "dataset preprocessing", "training loop", "evaluation", "benchmark datasets"], "summary_hash": "a27bf3db7ff5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:18:25+00:00"}
