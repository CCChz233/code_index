So we shouldn't include \"placement\", \"state\", \"state_code\" as keywords? Actually keywords list can include terms like \"placement\", \"state\", \"state code\". That's okay as they are not method names but concepts. But we must not list method names verbatim. The method names are __init__, __repr__, placement, state, state_code. So we should avoid \"placement\" as a method name? But \"placement\" is also a concept. Might be okay but to be safe we could use \"instance placement\", \"instance state\".

The instruction: Output ONLY valid JSON starting with {{ and ending with }}. That's ambiguous: they used double braces to show placeholder. Usually they want a JSON object with braces. We'll output single braces: {\"summary\": \"...\", ...}. The example shows {{\"summary\": \"...\", ...}} but that's just placeholder. Usually they want just JSON object.
