{"summary": "LayerScale implements a learnable per-dimension scaling factor that multiplies the output tensor of a layer. It initializes the scale with a user‑specified value (clamped between 0 and 1) and maintains a parameter sized to the projection dimension, applying it during the forward pass.", "business_intent": "Stabilize and improve training of deep neural networks—especially transformer‑based architectures—by introducing a controllable, learnable scaling operation that can regularize feature magnitudes and accelerate convergence.", "keywords": ["layer scaling", "learnable scalar", "projection dimension", "initialization", "deep learning", "transformer", "regularization", "training stability"], "summary_hash": "e61f42e4f4e4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:24:48+00:00"}
