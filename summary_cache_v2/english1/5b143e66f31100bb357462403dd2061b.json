{"summary": "Implements a Keras metric that computes the Intersection‑Over‑Union (IoU) for one‑hot encoded labels and predictions. It transforms one‑hot tensors to class indices, builds a weighted confusion matrix, supports class weighting, optional class ignoring, and returns the mean IoU across specified target classes.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to evaluate and monitor the performance of multi‑class segmentation or classification models that output probability vectors, providing a standard IoU score for model selection, hyper‑parameter tuning, and reporting.", "keywords": ["IoU", "Intersection over Union", "one-hot encoding", "multi-class segmentation", "confusion matrix", "sample weighting", "ignore class", "Keras metric", "model evaluation", "semantic segmentation"], "summary_hash": "51130a458aec", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:44:27+00:00"}
