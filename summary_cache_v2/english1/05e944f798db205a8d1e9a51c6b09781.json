{"summary": "The module implements a flexible Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architecture that processes an ordered set of multi‑scale feature maps, aligns their channel dimensions, and merges them through lateral and top‑down pathways to generate uniformly sized feature maps. It includes lightweight components for adding extra pyramid levels, such as a max‑pooling block for the deepest level and a block that creates P6/P7 levels for RetinaNet‑style heads, and it adapts convolution and pooling operations to work with arbitrary spatial dimensions (2‑D, 3‑D, etc.).", "business_intent": "Enable developers of medical imaging deep‑learning models to incorporate multi‑scale feature aggregation into their networks, supporting N‑dimensional data and common detection heads, thereby improving performance on tasks like object detection and segmentation.", "keywords": ["Feature Pyramid Network", "multi-scale", "N-D images", "convolution", "pooling", "extra pyramid levels", "max pooling", "RetinaNet", "backbone integration", "MONAI", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "09943ff865af", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:21:19+00:00"}
