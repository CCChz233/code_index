{"summary": "This module provides a unit‑test suite that checks the RandStdShiftIntensityd transformation, confirming that random standard deviation based intensity shifts are applied correctly to image data stored in dictionaries, that the randomness can be controlled, and that the output matches expected values across different NumPy array types.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and correctness of a medical imaging data augmentation step that modifies image intensities, thereby supporting robust model training pipelines in healthcare AI applications.", "keywords": ["unit test", "random intensity shift", "data augmentation", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "numpy arrays", "transform validation", "image intensity scaling", "dictionary-based data"], "summary_hash": "5897064e4e84", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:34:20+00:00"}
