{"summary": "The module defines a set of model wrappers that integrate various adapter mechanisms (linear adapters, IA3-infused adapters, LoRA adapters) into the Megatron‑T5 architecture. It handles adapter configuration, attachment to model components, training/validation loops, optimizer grouping, checkpoint serialization, and inference utilities, while exposing supported pretrained variants.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning solution for large Megatron‑T5 language models, allowing users to apply different adapter strategies (e.g., IA3, LoRA) to adapt the model to downstream NLP tasks without full model retraining.", "keywords": ["Megatron T5", "adapters", "IA3", "LoRA", "parameter-efficient fine-tuning", "language modeling", "model wrapper", "training", "inference", "checkpointing"], "summary_hash": "52cf76204ca4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:34:50+00:00"}
