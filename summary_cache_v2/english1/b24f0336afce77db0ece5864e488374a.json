{"summary": "The module implements a set of high‑performance recurrent neural network components tailored for large‑scale language modeling. It provides a block‑diagonal linear transformation, a 1‑D convolution layer, a real‑gated linear recurrent unit, and a full recurrent layer that maintain hidden states across time steps, leveraging fused GPU kernels and scan operations for efficient sequence processing.", "business_intent": "To enable fast, memory‑efficient training and inference of stateful language models by supplying optimized recurrent layers that can be integrated into Megatron‑based transformer architectures.", "keywords": ["recurrent neural network", "block diagonal linear", "1D convolution", "gated linear unit", "language modeling", "Megatron", "GPU acceleration", "fused operations", "scan kernel", "efficient inference"], "summary_hash": "24748e9d6937", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:38:29+00:00"}
