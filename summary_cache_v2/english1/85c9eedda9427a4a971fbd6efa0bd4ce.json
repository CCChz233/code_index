{"summary": "This module implements a full parser and object model for DynamoDB condition and filter expressions. It defines abstractions for attribute references, literal values, comparison operators, logical operators, and built‑in functions (e.g., begins_with, between, contains, size). The parser converts textual expressions into an abstract syntax tree composed of operand and operator nodes, which can then be rendered back into DynamoDB‑compatible expression strings or evaluated against mock items.", "business_intent": "Provide the Moto DynamoDB mock with the capability to understand, construct, and validate condition and filter expressions used in queries, scans, updates and deletes, ensuring that the mock behaves like the real DynamoDB service when processing expression syntax.", "keywords": ["DynamoDB", "condition expression", "filter expression", "parser", "abstract syntax tree", "attribute path", "comparison operator", "logical operator", "built‑in function", "mock service", "query", "scan", "update"], "summary_hash": "c767866350a5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:42:41+00:00"}
