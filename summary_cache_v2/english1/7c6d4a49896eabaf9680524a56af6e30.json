{"summary": "The file contains a suite of unit tests that validate the behavior of deep supervision loss implementations used for medical image segmentation, covering dice‑based loss, a combined dice‑cross‑entropy loss, and a dice‑focal loss. The tests assess reduction handling, output shapes, numerical correctness, and scriptability across supported PyTorch versions.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and correctness of segmentation loss functions in the MONAI framework, enabling developers to build stable deep learning pipelines for medical imaging applications.", "keywords": ["unit test", "deep supervision loss", "dice loss", "dice cross entropy", "dice focal loss", "segmentation", "medical imaging", "MONAI", "PyTorch", "script saving", "parameterized testing"], "summary_hash": "8e78953a448b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:49:47+00:00"}
