{"summary": "The module provides an example implementation of Graph Attention Networks (GAT) using the Deep Graph Library (DGL) with TensorFlow, applying sparse matrix‑vector (SPMV) optimizations for efficient graph convolutions. It defines a lightweight utility class that initializes the GAT layers and offers a simple interface to execute the model on graph data.", "business_intent": "To illustrate how to construct and run a GAT model in TensorFlow with DGL, serving as a reference for researchers, developers, or students building graph neural network solutions.", "keywords": ["Graph Attention Network", "GAT", "DGL", "TensorFlow", "SPMV", "sparse matrix multiplication", "graph neural network", "attention mechanism", "example code"], "summary_hash": "de9eea5d17ba", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:11:23+00:00"}
