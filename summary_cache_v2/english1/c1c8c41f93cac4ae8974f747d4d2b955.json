{"summary": "Defines a set of neural network modules for graph representation learning, including a Graph Convolutional Network, a hybrid GraphSAGE‑GCN, a layer‑normalization component, and a simple MLP predictor. The core class implements the Bootstrap Graph Representation Learning (BGRL) framework, maintaining an online encoder, a momentum‑updated target encoder, and a predictor that aligns online outputs with target projections. It provides initialization, forward passes to obtain node embeddings, parameter access, and target encoder updates.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use reference implementation for self‑supervised graph representation learning research and applications, enabling developers to train and evaluate bootstrap‑based graph neural networks on graph-structured data.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "BGRL", "bootstrap representation learning", "online encoder", "target encoder", "momentum update", "Graph Convolutional Network", "GraphSAGE", "layer normalization", "MLP predictor", "PyTorch", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "afbb57549068", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:13:24+00:00"}
