{"summary": "The module provides a collection of testing utilities for the Accelerate library. It defines base test case classes that automatically restore accelerator state, manage class‑wide mocks, and handle a shared temporary directory across tests. It also includes helpers for capturing subprocess output, asserting exceptions, and conditionally skipping or marking tests based on the presence of specific hardware, libraries, or environment configurations.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable and isolated unit and integration testing of the Accelerate framework by simplifying state management, mock handling, temporary resource cleanup, and conditional test execution depending on system capabilities.", "keywords": ["testing", "accelerate", "unittest", "mocking", "temporary directory", "subprocess", "environment checks", "hardware requirements", "state restoration", "skip", "slow"], "summary_hash": "b412e5de8bb5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:19:17+00:00"}
