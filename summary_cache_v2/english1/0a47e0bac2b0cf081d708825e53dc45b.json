{"summary": "Implements a configurable feed‑forward neural network block that projects an input tensor from a given dimension to an output dimension using a hidden layer scaled by a multiplier, applies a chosen activation function, and optionally adds dropout before and after the transformation.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable component for constructing deep learning models—particularly transformer‑style architectures—where a compact, parameterizable feed‑forward sub‑layer is required to introduce non‑linearity and regularization.", "keywords": ["feed-forward", "linear projection", "activation function", "dropout", "multiplier", "hidden dimension", "bias", "neural network layer", "transformer"], "summary_hash": "353ea25518ef", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:08:33+00:00"}
