{"summary": "The test_prepare package contains unit tests that verify the preparation stage of a groundwater modeling workflow. It checks conversion of line geometries into 3‑D polygons, allocation of top‑layer boundary condition cells and conductance distribution, and supplies helper utilities to generate synthetic allocation, distribution, and boundary‑condition datasets for a wide range of test scenarios.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of data preparation routines used to set up groundwater models, thereby reducing errors in boundary condition handling and geometry processing before simulation runs.", "keywords": ["groundwater modeling", "data preparation", "unit testing", "geometry conversion", "boundary conditions", "synthetic dataset generation", "top layer allocation", "conductance distribution", "test utilities"], "summary_hash": "0d2830c9f4e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:05:21+00:00"}
