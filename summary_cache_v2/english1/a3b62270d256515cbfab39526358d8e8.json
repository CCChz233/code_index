It defines a Plot manager that collects plot definitions, resolves data sources, computes differences between revisions, and renders the final visual output using templating. Custom exceptions are provided for invalid plot objects and metric type errors, and a set of helper utilities support path normalization, data loading, and image handling.", "business_intent": "To empower DVC users to generate, compare, and display metric visualizations across data versions, facilitating experiment tracking, reproducibility, and insight into model performance over time.", "keywords": ["DVC", "plots", "visualization", "data versioning", "metric rendering", "diff", "template rendering", "image support", "exception handling", "pipeline integration"], "summary_hash": "133c6a6a820b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:27:08+00:00"}
