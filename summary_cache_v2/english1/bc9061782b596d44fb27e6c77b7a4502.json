{"summary": "Implements the HGP‑SL pooling layer, which hierarchically coarsens a graph by learning a refined adjacency structure and selecting a subset of nodes based on a configurable pooling ratio. The layer supports optional k‑hop union graph sampling, symmetric adjacency normalization, edge sparsemax or softmax, and a leaky‑ReLU based structure‑learning term, and returns the pooled DGLGraph, updated node and edge features, and the permutation indices of the retained nodes.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use hierarchical graph pooling component for graph neural network pipelines, enabling efficient graph size reduction while preserving structural information for downstream tasks such as graph classification, regression, or representation learning.", "keywords": ["hierarchical pooling", "graph neural networks", "structure learning", "adjacency normalization", "sparsemax", "leaky ReLU", "DGL", "graph coarsening", "node selection", "edge weighting"], "summary_hash": "c41300dc5089", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:11:43+00:00"}
