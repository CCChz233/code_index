{"summary": "The module implements the Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) backend used by the benchmarking suite. It supplies a configuration dataclass that validates and maps backend‑specific parameters such as data types and version information, and a backend class that loads models (pretrained or weight‑less), prepares inputs, and runs inference operations including forward passes, text generation and prefill. It also supports optional data‑parallel execution through IPEX’s distributed capabilities.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate and efficient performance measurement of deep learning models on Intel hardware by providing an optimized IPEX backend for the benchmarking framework.", "keywords": ["IPEX", "Intel Extension for PyTorch", "benchmarking", "inference", "model loading", "data parallel", "dtype mapping", "configuration", "performance evaluation", "text generation", "prefill"], "summary_hash": "1b151459c994", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:32:44+00:00"}
