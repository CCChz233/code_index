{"summary": "A test suite that validates array retrieval behavior under various memory layouts and execution contexts. It provides helper routines to create contiguous and non‑contiguous arrays, sets up test fixtures, and runs a series of checks covering standard, cross‑device, streaming, error, and multi‑GPU scenarios.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of array get operations across different memory configurations and hardware environments, supporting reliable data processing in high‑performance or deep‑learning applications.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "array retrieval", "contiguous memory", "non‑contiguous memory", "multi‑GPU", "error handling", "streaming", "cross‑device", "test fixtures", "helper functions"], "summary_hash": "53e631ed0fe2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T19:48:38+00:00"}
