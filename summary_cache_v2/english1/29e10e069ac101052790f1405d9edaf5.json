{"summary": "Provides a comprehensive test suite that verifies JAX's `debug_nans` feature across different compilation strategies (jit, pjit, pmap). The tests cover detection of NaNs and infinities in various scenarios, including functions returning single or multiple results, operations that trigger division by zero, and cases involving memory donation.", "business_intent": "Ensure the robustness and correctness of JAX's NaN/Inf debugging utilities, helping developers catch numerical errors early and maintain reliable scientific computing pipelines.", "keywords": ["JAX", "debug_nans", "NaN detection", "testing", "jit", "pjit", "pmap", "memory donation", "zero division", "numerical debugging"], "summary_hash": "5479cf9c285c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:03:11+00:00"}
