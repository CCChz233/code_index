{"summary": "Provides a full stack for handling OpenQASM 3 code within Qiskit, including an abstract syntax tree model, utilities to parse and load programs, an exporter that translates Qiskit QuantumCircuit objects into OpenQASM 3 source, and a printer that renders the AST back to formatted code. Supports experimental language features and an optional native Rust parser for faster, more diagnostic imports.", "business_intent": "Facilitate seamless interoperability between Qiskit and the OpenQASM 3 language, allowing users to serialize, deserialize, and manipulate quantum circuits as standard OpenQASM 3 programs for portability, analysis, and integration with other tools.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "OpenQASM 3", "quantum circuit", "serialization", "import", "export", "AST", "parser", "printer", "Rust", "gate definitions", "control flow"], "summary_hash": "6abfaa95ec8f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:03:41+00:00"}
