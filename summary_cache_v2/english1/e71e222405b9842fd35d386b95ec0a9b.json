{"summary": "The module defines a collection of unit tests that validate the behavior of Cupy's fusion mechanism for universal functions. It checks correct broadcasting, handling of invalid broadcast scenarios, output data type enforcement, parsing of function inputs, and proper processing of both NumPy and native Python scalars, including in‑place operations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the fusion feature in Cupy works reliably across diverse input shapes, data types, and scalar forms, thereby maintaining numerical correctness and compatibility with NumPy semantics.", "keywords": ["cupy", "fusion", "ufunc", "broadcasting", "dtype", "scalar", "unit testing", "unittest", "numpy compatibility"], "summary_hash": "4e130d82ea9b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:29:33+00:00"}
