{"summary": "The script orchestrates the training and evaluation of a heteronym classification model for grapheme‑to‑phoneme conversion in text‑to‑speech. It parses a Hydra configuration, initializes the NeMo heteronym classification model, sets up experiment management and logging, configures a PyTorch Lightning trainer with callbacks (including epoch timing), and runs the training and optional evaluation pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to train and assess a heteronym classification model that improves pronunciation handling of ambiguous words in TTS systems.", "keywords": ["training", "evaluation", "heteronym classification", "grapheme-to-phoneme", "TTS", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning", "model", "experiment management", "logging", "callbacks"], "summary_hash": "124e0147a2cf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:36:26+00:00"}
