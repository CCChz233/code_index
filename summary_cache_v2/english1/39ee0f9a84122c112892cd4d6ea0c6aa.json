{"summary": "The file contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests for quantum synthesis methods, focusing on verifying the correctness, robustness, and edge‑case handling of various decomposition algorithms for both single‑qubit and two‑qubit gates. It includes tests for exact factorization, parameter extraction, round‑trip consistency, exception handling, and serialization across a wide range of gate families and random inputs.", "business_intent": "Validate that quantum circuit synthesis components produce accurate and reliable decompositions, ensuring that compiled quantum programs behave as intended and that the underlying algorithms are robust against diverse inputs and edge cases.", "keywords": ["quantum synthesis", "gate decomposition", "unit testing", "single‑qubit Euler angles", "two‑qubit basis decomposition", "controlled‑U decomposition", "Weyl decomposition", "randomized testing", "exception handling", "serialization"], "summary_hash": "5350d163194c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:36:57+00:00"}
