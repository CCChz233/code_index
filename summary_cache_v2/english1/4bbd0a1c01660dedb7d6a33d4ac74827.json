{"summary": "This module provides an implementation of the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metric, including a Metric subclass that accumulates feature statistics from real and generated images and computes the distance using covariance and matrix square‑root operations, along with helper utilities for these calculations and a simple accessor for the final score.", "business_intent": "Enable quantitative evaluation of generative medical imaging models by measuring how closely synthetic image distributions match real data, facilitating model validation and comparison.", "keywords": ["FID", "Frechet Inception Distance", "metric", "evaluation", "generative models", "image synthesis", "medical imaging", "PyTorch", "NumPy", "covariance", "matrix square root"], "summary_hash": "d623fb2adbee", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:13:44+00:00"}
