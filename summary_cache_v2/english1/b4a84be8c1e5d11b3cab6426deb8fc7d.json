{"summary": "This module implements a component that prepares and executes a node‑prediction apply pipeline. It loads and merges configuration settings, utilizes factory helpers for data, model, and pipeline creation, renders a runnable script from a Jinja2 template, and writes the resulting files. The component is designed for command‑line use via Typer, streamlining the deployment of a pre‑trained node prediction model on new graph data.", "business_intent": "Provide an automated, user‑friendly way to apply a trained node‑prediction model to fresh graph datasets by generating the necessary execution script and handling all configuration details.", "keywords": ["node prediction", "apply pipeline", "configuration management", "script generation", "Jinja2 template", "YAML merging", "factory pattern", "DGL", "PyTorch", "Typer CLI"], "summary_hash": "f8de87f25a9e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:01:17+00:00"}
