{"summary": "The class implements a Laplacian filter operator that convolves a configurable kernel across each channel of a 4‑dimensional tensor (batch, channel, height, width). It handles padding according to the selected border mode and can optionally normalize the kernel, returning a tensor of the same shape.", "business_intent": "Enable easy application of Laplacian‑based smoothing or edge‑enhancement in neural network pipelines, facilitating preprocessing, feature extraction, or regularization for image‑like data.", "keywords": ["Laplacian", "convolution", "kernel", "padding", "normalization", "batch processing", "tensor", "image processing", "edge detection", "smoothing", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "48e05b110da8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:44:37+00:00"}
