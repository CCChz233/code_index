{"summary": "A configuration container that encapsulates all hyperparameters required to build a LayoutLM transformer model, including token vocab size, hidden dimensions, number of layers and heads, activation functions, dropout rates, and both 1‑D and 2‑D positional embedding settings. It inherits from a generic BERT configuration and is used to instantiate a LayoutLM model with the desired architecture.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to customize and instantiate LayoutLM models for document image understanding by specifying architectural details and initialization parameters in a single, reusable object.", "keywords": ["LayoutLM", "configuration", "transformer", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "position embeddings", "2D embeddings", "BertConfig", "model initialization"], "summary_hash": "77db7168f165", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:42:46+00:00"}
