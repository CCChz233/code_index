{"summary": "Provides a command‑line tool that constructs an on‑disk Faiss IVF index for fast K‑nearest‑neighbor lookup over a pre‑processed text retrieval database. It tokenizes the data, computes sentence embeddings, and supports a three‑stage workflow: training the index, building shard indexes in parallel across devices, and merging shards into a final index file.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, efficient similarity search for large language‑model retrieval datasets, supporting retrieval‑augmented training or inference pipelines.", "keywords": ["faiss", "retrieval index", "knn", "embedding", "tokenizer", "sentencepiece", "multiprocessing", "sharding", "on-disk index", "language modeling", "megatrons", "vector search"], "summary_hash": "3f848301c11a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:43:20+00:00"}
