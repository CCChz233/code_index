{"summary": "The example showcases how to construct a fully customizable training loop for a PyTorch LightningModule using Lightning Fabric. It provides a lightweight trainer class that manages optimizer and scheduler setup, training and validation steps, checkpointing, and progress reporting, and a script that trains a simple MNIST digit classifier with this trainer.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate the ease of building bespoke training pipelines that leverage Fabric’s hardware orchestration while giving developers full control over the training process, facilitating rapid prototyping and educational use cases.", "keywords": ["Lightning Fabric", "custom trainer", "PyTorch", "MNIST", "training loop", "optimizer", "scheduler", "checkpointing", "progress reporting", "deep learning example"], "summary_hash": "06e8d11cc827", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:12:09+00:00"}
