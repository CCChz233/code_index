{"summary": "A utility package that supports building and assessing transformer‑based neural language models for automatic speech recognition rescoring. It includes a command‑line tool to convert raw text corpora into tokenized, chunked tar archives suitable for training, and an evaluation script that computes word error rates, optimizes interpolation parameters, and reports the impact of neural LM scores on ASR hypotheses.", "business_intent": "Enable the creation of high‑quality training data and the quantitative evaluation of neural language model rescoring to reduce transcription errors and improve overall speech‑recognition performance.", "keywords": ["transformer", "neural language model", "ASR", "rescoring", "dataset preparation", "tokenization", "tar archives", "WER evaluation", "interpolation weighting", "speech recognition accuracy"], "summary_hash": "125574371719", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:15:54+00:00"}
