{"summary": "SparseAdam is an optimizer that applies the Adam adaptive learning-rate algorithm in a sparse manner to DGL node embeddings, updating only the embeddings that receive gradient signals while maintaining per‑embedding first and second moment statistics. It can use pinned memory for CPU‑resident embeddings to accelerate training.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, memory‑efficient optimizer for large node embedding tables in graph neural network training, reducing computation and memory overhead while preserving adaptive learning‑rate benefits.", "keywords": ["Sparse Adam", "node embedding", "graph neural network", "adaptive optimizer", "memory efficiency", "pinned memory", "CPU", "GPU", "DGL", "training acceleration"], "summary_hash": "95f3a357e516", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:57:33+00:00"}
