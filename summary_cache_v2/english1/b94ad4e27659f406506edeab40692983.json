{"summary": "This module supplies shared utilities for Flax‑based diffusion schedulers, including a dataclass that holds common scheduler configuration and runtime state, a mixin that adds loading, saving, and compatibility lookup capabilities, and an output container for scheduler steps. It also provides helper functions for noise addition, alpha‑bar computation, beta generation, shape broadcasting, and retrieval of schedule‑related parameters such as sqrt(alpha) products and velocity terms.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to implement, serialize, and manage diffusion scheduler logic in Flax/JAX projects with a consistent API and reusable components, simplifying model training and inference pipelines that rely on diffusion processes.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "Flax", "JAX", "state management", "serialization", "noise addition", "alpha schedule", "beta generation", "utility functions"], "summary_hash": "95ff32a6ce06", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:13:03+00:00"}
