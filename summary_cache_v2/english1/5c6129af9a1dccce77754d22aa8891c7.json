{"summary": "The module implements a full training pipeline for personalizing Stable Diffusion XL models via DreamBooth with low‑rank adaptation (LoRA). It defines data handling for instance and class images, manages token embeddings for new concepts, selects and configures schedulers, loads and wraps the diffusion model, runs a distributed training loop with validation, and saves the adapted model and metadata.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use solution for businesses and creators to efficiently customize large text‑to‑image diffusion models with their own visual concepts, reducing compute costs through LoRA while maintaining high‑quality image generation.", "keywords": ["DreamBooth", "LoRA", "Stable Diffusion XL", "fine‑tuning", "diffusion model", "custom dataset", "token embedding", "distributed training", "model checkpoint", "validation", "Hugging Face", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "7f526804f391", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:57:37+00:00"}
