{"summary": "Utility module for reading and processing MODFLOW 6 DISV (discrete vertical) output files. It provides functions to open CBC, HDS, and other budget files, extract horizontal and lower‑face fluxes, compute index mappings between the DISV representation and unstructured grid structures, and assemble the results into xarray/xugrid datasets with proper time coordinates.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream hydrologic analysis and visualization by converting raw MODFLOW 6 DISV budget outputs into structured, time‑indexed data that can be readily used in Python scientific workflows.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW 6", "DISV", "budget extraction", "horizontal flux", "lower face flux", "grid indexing", "xarray", "xugrid", "sparse matrices", "time series"], "summary_hash": "b79131c6f1a1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:02:02+00:00"}
