{"summary": "This module supplies a suite of numerical samplers for diffusion‑based generative models. It defines a common base sampler that manages sigma schedules and loop initialization, and implements multiple concrete strategies—Euler, Heun, ancestral, DPMPP, EDM, linear multistep, and single‑step—each providing specific integration rules and correction steps to advance the reverse diffusion process and generate samples from a trained model.", "business_intent": "To enable flexible, high‑performance generation of images or other modalities in production AI systems by offering a range of configurable diffusion sampling algorithms within the NeMo stable‑diffusion framework.", "keywords": ["diffusion sampling", "ancestral sampler", "Euler integration", "Heun method", "DPMPP", "EDM", "linear multistep", "generative AI", "latent diffusion", "inference", "NeMo", "stable diffusion"], "summary_hash": "3fd9d692c511", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:02:48+00:00"}
