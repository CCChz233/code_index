{"summary": "This module implements a raster source that wraps the rasterio library to read geospatial raster datasets. It handles activation (including optional downloading), exposes core spatial metadata such as extent, coordinate reference system, transform, and data type, and provides functionality to extract sub‑regions (chips) as NumPy arrays.", "business_intent": "Enable machine‑learning and remote‑sensing workflows to reliably ingest and manipulate large raster imagery by offering a standardized, activation‑aware interface for reading raster data and retrieving image tiles with associated geospatial metadata.", "keywords": ["rasterio", "raster source", "geospatial raster", "activation", "download", "spatial metadata", "CRS", "transform", "data type", "window extraction", "chip extraction", "NumPy array", "remote sensing", "machine learning"], "summary_hash": "a0c96e40da70", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T16:01:49+00:00"}
