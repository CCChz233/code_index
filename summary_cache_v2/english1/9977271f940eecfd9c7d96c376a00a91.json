{"summary": "Integrates IA3 parameter‑efficient adapters into each transformer layer of a GPT model, scaling key, value and feed‑forward hidden activations. The adapters are lightweight vectors that can be trained for a specific downstream task, saved, and later re‑loaded to infuse the base GPT model for inference without retraining the full model.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, cost‑effective customization of large language models for various applications by allowing task‑specific adaptation through small, reusable adapter weights, facilitating rapid deployment and scaling of tailored GPT solutions.", "keywords": ["GPT", "IA3", "adapter", "transformer", "parameter-efficient fine-tuning", "task-specific adaptation", "inference", "activation scaling", "key/value", "feed-forward"], "summary_hash": "7d55cf97432a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:06:39+00:00"}
