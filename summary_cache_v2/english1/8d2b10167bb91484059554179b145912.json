{"summary": "This module implements utilities for transforming Megatron model hidden states. It defines a base interface that validates inputs and standardizes naming, and a concrete transform that interprets hidden vectors as the mean and log‑variance of a diagonal Gaussian distribution, producing samples via the reparameterization trick for differentiable stochastic processing.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable component that enables variational or stochastic modeling within large‑scale NLP architectures, allowing developers to incorporate latent Gaussian variables into Megatron‑based models for tasks such as uncertainty estimation, generative modeling, or regularization.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "hidden state transformation", "Gaussian distribution", "diagonal covariance", "reparameterization trick", "stochastic sampling", "variational inference", "NLP", "PyTorch", "Apex", "model initialization"], "summary_hash": "eda9640f45e9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:25:04+00:00"}
