{"summary": "The module presents a step‑by‑step tutorial that implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using DGL and PyTorch. It defines a custom graph convolution layer that aggregates neighbor features, builds a two‑layer GCN model, loads the Cora citation graph, and runs a simple training and evaluation loop to illustrate semi‑supervised node classification.", "business_intent": "Educate developers and researchers on constructing and training GCNs with DGL, demonstrating the underlying message‑passing mechanics and providing a reference implementation for learning and experimentation.", "keywords": ["GCN", "Graph Convolutional Network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "message passing", "Cora dataset", "graph neural network", "tutorial", "semi-supervised classification"], "summary_hash": "5099f4033a8f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:58:50+00:00"}
