{"summary": "The module defines a diffusion pipeline that encodes an input image into latent space, performs LEDITS++ text‑driven editing using Stable Diffusion’s UNet and custom cross‑attention processing, manages attention information across steps, optionally applies Gaussian smoothing, and decodes the edited latents back to an image while handling safety checking and scheduler coordination.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to apply advanced text‑guided image editing with the LEDITS++ method on top of Stable Diffusion, providing a ready‑to‑use pipeline that integrates safety checks, scheduler flexibility, and support for LoRA, IP‑Adapter, and textual inversion extensions.", "keywords": ["diffusion pipeline", "text-guided image editing", "Stable Diffusion", "cross-attention", "LEDITS++", "latent space", "attention store", "Gaussian smoothing", "safety checker", "scheduler", "LoRA", "IP‑Adapter", "textual inversion"], "summary_hash": "ac734db6ebe0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:22:19+00:00"}
