{"summary": "The module defines a loss component for automatic speech recognition that extends the standard RNN‑Transducer loss to tolerate missing tokens at the beginning or end of an utterance. It builds the necessary graph structures using the k2 library and provides a forward routine that computes the loss while remaining compatible with conventional RNN‑T decoding pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable more robust training of speech‑to‑text models by handling incomplete or partially annotated transcripts, thereby improving model performance and reducing data preparation constraints in production ASR systems.", "keywords": ["ASR", "speech recognition", "transducer loss", "W‑Transducer", "k2", "graph", "RNN‑Transducer", "missing text", "training robustness", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "76824536c450", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:13:38+00:00"}
