{"summary": "This module implements the Solovay‑Kitaev algorithm for synthesizing arbitrary single‑qubit unitaries as sequences of gates drawn from a finite universal basis. It provides a class that loads pre‑computed elementary approximations, builds lookup keys, and recursively decomposes target gates into a gate sequence suitable for the Qiskit transpiler. The file also contains a few helper utilities that are currently unused.", "business_intent": "Allow quantum circuits to be compiled for hardware with a limited native gate set by automatically converting any single‑qubit operation into an equivalent sequence of basis gates, thereby improving compatibility and execution fidelity on real quantum devices.", "keywords": ["solovay-kitaev", "gate synthesis", "discrete basis", "single-qubit approximation", "quantum transpilation", "recursive decomposition", "lookup table", "gate sequence", "quantum compilation"], "summary_hash": "b7c76d0eff69", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:04:06+00:00"}
