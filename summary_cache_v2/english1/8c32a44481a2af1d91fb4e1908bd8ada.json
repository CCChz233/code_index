{"summary": "The ImageStitcher class combines two overlapping images into a single seamless composite by detecting matching features, estimating a homography transformation, and blending the aligned images. It supports configurable feature matchers, homography estimators (including a RANSAC option for higher accuracy), and a basic blending strategy, and is optimized for GPU execution.", "business_intent": "Enable automated creation of panoramic or wide‑view images for applications such as mapping, virtual tours, surveillance, and visual content generation, reducing manual effort and computational cost.", "keywords": ["image stitching", "feature matching", "homography estimation", "RANSAC", "blending", "panorama generation", "computer vision", "GPU acceleration", "overlapping fields of view", "visual content creation"], "summary_hash": "a25f44d00e37", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:47:44+00:00"}
