{"summary": "The multipliers package supplies a collection of quantum circuit components that compute the product of two quantum registers. It includes implementations based on classical shift‑and‑add techniques using ripple‑carry adders, a generic equal‑size multiplier that writes the result into a doubled‑width register to avoid overflow, and a QFT‑based approach that performs multiplication in the Fourier basis using controlled phase rotations and the Ruiz‑Perez algorithm.", "business_intent": "To equip quantum algorithm developers with ready‑to‑use, efficient multiplication primitives that can be integrated into larger quantum programs, enabling arithmetic operations required for cryptographic, simulation, and optimization workloads on quantum hardware.", "keywords": ["quantum multiplication", "quantum circuit", "arithmetic", "ripple-carry adder", "shifted addition", "QFT", "Quantum Fourier Transform", "controlled phase rotation", "Ruiz-Perez algorithm", "overflow prevention", "quantum registers"], "summary_hash": "405982e227b4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:07:51+00:00"}
