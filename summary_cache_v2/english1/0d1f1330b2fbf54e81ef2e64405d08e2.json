{"summary": "The module implements a high‑level abstraction for creating and managing Kubernetes Jobs within Metaflow. It defines a job configuration class that assembles metadata, container image, command, resources, environment variables, secrets and annotations, and launches the job using the Kubernetes API. A companion class tracks a running job’s pod and containers, exposing methods to inspect status, detect success or failure, and terminate the job. Small helper utilities support decoration and retry logic.", "business_intent": "Allow Metaflow users to execute workflow steps as isolated Kubernetes Jobs without dealing with low‑level Kubernetes client code, thereby enabling scalable, container‑based execution of data‑science pipelines on a Kubernetes cluster.", "keywords": ["Kubernetes", "Job", "Metaflow", "container", "pod", "resource allocation", "environment variables", "secrets", "job lifecycle", "status monitoring", "termination", "API abstraction", "workflow execution"], "summary_hash": "47d1aa075997", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:11:04+00:00"}
