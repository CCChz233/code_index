{"summary": "Defines an abstract base class that encapsulates the common logic for readout error mitigation in quantum experiments. It supplies utilities to transform raw measurement counts into corrected expectation values and quasi‑probability distributions using calibration data.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum software developers and researchers to compensate for measurement errors, improving the accuracy of result analysis and supporting reliable benchmarking of quantum algorithms.", "keywords": ["readout error mitigation", "quantum measurement", "expectation value", "quasi-probability distribution", "calibration", "error correction", "quantum computing", "abstract base class", "counts", "numpy"], "summary_hash": "9703e8412638", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:01:57+00:00"}
