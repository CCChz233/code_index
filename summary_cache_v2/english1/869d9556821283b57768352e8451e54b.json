{"summary": "The module implements high‑level factory classes that automatically select and instantiate the correct diffusion pipeline for a given task (image‑to‑image, inpainting, or text‑to‑image) based on model configuration or an existing pipeline instance, while preventing direct construction of the factories.", "business_intent": "Provide a user‑friendly interface that abstracts away the complexity of choosing the right diffusion pipeline, enabling developers to load pretrained models and perform image generation tasks with minimal setup.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "pipeline", "factory", "auto selection", "image2image", "inpainting", "text2image", "model configuration", "pretrained model", "HuggingFace"], "summary_hash": "800bb19a32d8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:12:03+00:00"}
