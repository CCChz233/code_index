{"summary": "Provides stochastic 3‑D rotation augmentation for volumetric tensors, supporting single or batched inputs, optional prior transformation matrices, and configurable degree ranges, resampling modes, and interpolation settings. The class can output transformed data together with an updated homogeneous transformation matrix, enabling seamless integration into neural network pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enhance the variability and robustness of 3‑D image datasets—such as medical scans—by automatically applying random rotations during model training, thereby improving generalization of deep learning models.", "keywords": ["random rotation", "3D volume", "data augmentation", "transformation matrix", "batch processing", "interpolation", "degrees range", "resample", "torch", "nn.Sequential"], "summary_hash": "02e7cb9bbf92", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:56:57+00:00"}
