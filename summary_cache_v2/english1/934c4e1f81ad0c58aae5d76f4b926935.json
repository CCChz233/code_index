{"summary": "The package implements a GPU‑based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) subsystem that mirrors NumPy’s FFT interface. It supplies utilities for selecting GPUs for the cuFFT backend and offers high‑level functions for 1‑D, 2‑D and N‑D forward and inverse transforms, real‑valued transforms, frequency‑bin generation, and shift operations, while handling data‑type conversion and cuFFT plan management.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and researchers with a high‑performance, drop‑in replacement for NumPy’s FFT routines that leverages NVIDIA GPUs, enabling faster signal processing, scientific simulations, and data analysis workloads.", "keywords": ["GPU", "FFT", "cuFFT", "Fourier transform", "CuPy", "configuration", "plan management", "NumPy compatibility", "real-valued transform", "frequency bins", "shift operation"], "summary_hash": "c290f8199d3a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:34:19+00:00"}
