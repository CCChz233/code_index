{"summary": "Provides utilities to divide a MODFLOW‑6 groundwater model into independent sub‑models based on a label array. It validates the partition labels, creates partition metadata, and slices model components (boundary conditions, wells, flow barriers, auxiliary variables) to generate self‑contained sub‑models confined to their active grid domains.", "business_intent": "Facilitate modular or parallel groundwater simulations and scenario analyses by automatically extracting smaller, manageable sub‑models from a large MODFLOW‑6 model.", "keywords": ["model partitioning", "submodel extraction", "MODFLOW 6", "groundwater modeling", "boundary conditions", "wells", "flow barriers", "auxiliary variables", "grid slicing", "active domain"], "summary_hash": "03ea0c8bf5d2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:00:45+00:00"}
