{"summary": "Provides a dictionary transform that randomly extracts a configurable number of image patches with a given spatial size, using a supplied weight map to bias the sampling locations. The transform can operate lazily, deferring the actual cropping until later in the pipeline.", "business_intent": "Enables data augmentation in medical imaging and other volumetric data workflows by generating region‑biased patches for training deep learning models, improving representation of important structures and reducing class imbalance.", "keywords": ["random weighted cropping", "patch sampling", "weight map", "lazy execution", "dictionary transform", "data augmentation", "medical imaging", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "28d310a7f200", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:04:52+00:00"}
