{"summary": "A unit‑test module that checks the MONAI KSpaceSpikeNoised transform. It creates synthetic 2‑D and 3‑D images, applies the transform under deterministic settings, and verifies that the output maintains the original data shape, correctly injects spike noise visible in the image, and yields consistent results across runs.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability of the K‑space spike noise simulation used in medical imaging pipelines, providing confidence that the transform behaves as expected for research, development, and validation of imaging algorithms.", "keywords": ["KSpaceSpikeNoised", "MONAI", "unit testing", "synthetic image", "spike noise", "k-space", "deterministic", "numpy", "torch", "parameterized", "image integrity", "pixel highlighting"], "summary_hash": "740614c21b37", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:51:09+00:00"}
