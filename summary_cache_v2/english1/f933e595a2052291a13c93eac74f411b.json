{"summary": "The module defines an inference‑time dataset that transforms raw text queries into tokenized, overlapping BERT‑compatible segments for punctuation and capitalization restoration. It manages special tokens, enforces maximum sequence length, applies configurable step sizes, and trims margins to produce clean model inputs, while providing helper utilities for validation and subtoken mask generation.", "business_intent": "To support production deployment of punctuation and capitalization models by preprocessing raw text into appropriately formatted BERT inputs, enabling accurate and efficient inference within NLP applications.", "keywords": ["inference dataset", "tokenization", "BERT", "punctuation restoration", "capitalization restoration", "overlapping segments", "sequence length constraint", "step size", "margin trimming", "NLP preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "536a99e78a64", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:27:56+00:00"}
