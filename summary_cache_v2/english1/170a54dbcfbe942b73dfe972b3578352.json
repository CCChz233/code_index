{"summary": "The module implements a multi‑GPU example that trains a relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) on several RDF entity‑classification datasets. It defines the RGCN architecture, sets up distributed PyTorch processes, loads graph data, creates neighbor‑sampling data loaders, wraps the model with DistributedDataParallel, runs a training loop, and evaluates classification accuracy.", "business_intent": "Showcase scalable training of graph neural networks for knowledge‑graph entity classification using DGL and PyTorch’s distributed capabilities, providing a reference implementation for high‑performance multi‑GPU deployment.", "keywords": ["RGCN", "relational graph convolution", "multi‑GPU", "distributed training", "PyTorch", "DGL", "entity classification", "knowledge graph", "neighbor sampling", "benchmark datasets"], "summary_hash": "6e68450761c2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:18:59+00:00"}
