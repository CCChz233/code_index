{"summary": "The module supplies a collection of server implementations for the NTLMRelayX tool, covering HTTP, raw TCP, SMB, SOCKS, and WCF protocols. Each server listens for incoming client connections, captures NTLM authentication data, and forwards the credentials to a configured target service to perform relay attacks. They manage protocol‑specific handshakes, session handling, logging, and optional post‑authentication actions such as command execution, hash extraction, or traffic proxying.", "business_intent": "Provide reusable server components that enable credential relay attacks by intercepting NTLM authentication and forwarding it to victim services, supporting penetration testing and exploitation of Windows authentication mechanisms.", "keywords": ["NTLM relay", "credential forwarding", "SMB relay", "HTTP relay", "SOCKS proxy", "WCF relay", "authentication harvesting", "penetration testing", "network proxy", "post‑authentication actions"], "summary_hash": "2f1d8c49877b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:24:36+00:00"}
