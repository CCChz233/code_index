{"summary": "Implements a dictionary-like container that maps circuit parameters to collections of instruction references (instruction and parameter index pairs). It supports standard mapping operations and offers utilities to retrieve parameter names, look up parameters by name, and discard stored references.", "business_intent": "Enables systematic tracking and management of the relationships between circuit parameters and the specific instruction instances that use them, supporting reference cleanup and lookup during circuit analysis or transformation.", "keywords": ["parameter mapping", "instruction references", "set-like collection", "reference management", "circuit parameters", "lookup", "cleanup", "dictionary container"], "summary_hash": "37b5bb585c20", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:06:14+00:00"}
