{"summary": "The module implements utilities for preparing and loading BERT pre‑training data. It includes a dataset that tokenizes raw text, creates masked language modeling targets, aligns sequence lengths, optionally truncates sentence pairs, and provides document‑level access. It also offers a dataset and iterator that read pre‑processed examples from HDF5 files, delivering tensors in the format expected by BERT models.", "business_intent": "Facilitate scalable and efficient BERT language‑model pre‑training within the NeMo framework by handling data preprocessing, masking, and high‑throughput loading of large corpora.", "keywords": ["BERT", "pretraining", "dataset", "PyTorch", "tokenization", "masking", "HDF5", "data loading", "language modeling", "NLP", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "609c532f2ff4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:27:35+00:00"}
