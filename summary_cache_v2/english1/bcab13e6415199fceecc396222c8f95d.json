{"summary": "A neural network layer that aggregates temporal features by computing the average (and optionally the standard deviation) across the time axis of a [B, D, T] tensor, yielding a [B, D] representation. It supports two pooling strategies—simple mean (time‑average pooling) and a combined mean‑plus‑std (x‑vector) mode—with configurable epsilon for numerical stability and an option to use a biased variance estimator.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream models to obtain compact, fixed‑size embeddings from variable‑length sequences, facilitating tasks such as speaker verification, speech recognition, or any application requiring temporal summarization of feature maps.", "keywords": ["pooling", "mean", "standard deviation", "time average", "xvector", "tensor", "neural network layer", "epsilon", "biased estimator", "speech processing"], "summary_hash": "4e121669ee10", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:29:32+00:00"}
