{"summary": "The class encapsulates a collection of validation and preprocessing utilities used to verify and normalize configuration settings for an image‑processing or sensor‑data pipeline. It checks individual parameter constraints (such as color, mode, cutoff, ranges, thresholds, bits, temperature, shadows, fog coefficients, noise settings, and ROI definitions) and provides helper routines for normalizing thresholds and handling blur or threshold processing.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that all incoming configuration data conforms to expected formats and limits before the main processing stages run, thereby preventing runtime errors and ensuring consistent, reliable image or sensor analysis.", "keywords": ["validation", "schema", "parameter checking", "image processing", "threshold normalization", "blur handling", "fog coefficient validation", "noise parameters", "range verification", "temperature validation", "shadow validation", "ROI validation", "data integrity"], "summary_hash": "5a41adfd5c11", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:17:07+00:00"}
