{"summary": "Implements an iterative bidirectional routing strategy to select an optimal qubit layout for a quantum circuit. Starting from random (or supplied) layouts, it performs a full routing pass forward, then routes the reversed circuit, repeating until a layout that reduces total swap cost is found. The pass also handles ancilla allocation and can operate either as a combined layout‑and‑routing pass or as a pure layout selector.", "business_intent": "Reduce the number of SWAP gates required to map a quantum circuit onto a device’s coupling map, thereby improving execution fidelity and performance on NISQ hardware.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "layout", "routing", "swap minimization", "bidirectional", "iterative", "random seeds", "ancilla allocation", "coupling map", "mapping optimization", "SABRE algorithm", "NISQ", "qubit mapping"], "summary_hash": "f16c26a5e584", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:29:14+00:00"}
