{"summary": "The module supplies a collection of utilities for rendering quantum states in various visual formats, such as Bloch sphere vectors, city‑style amplitude maps, Hinton diagrams, and LaTeX ket notation. It handles conversion of statevector and density‑matrix data into plot‑ready structures and provides helper classes for neatly formatted textual matrices.", "business_intent": "Enable users and developers to intuitively inspect and communicate quantum state information through graphical and textual representations, facilitating debugging, education, and presentation of quantum algorithms.", "keywords": ["quantum state visualization", "Bloch sphere", "city plot", "Hinton diagram", "LaTeX ket", "statevector", "density matrix", "matplotlib", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "9a3e79ac7dee", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:50:08+00:00"}
