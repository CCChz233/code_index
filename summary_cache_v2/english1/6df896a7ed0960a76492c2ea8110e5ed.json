{"summary": "The module defines a MegatronGPTSFTModel class that encapsulates the full supervised fine‑tuning workflow for Megatron‑based GPT models. It constructs and blends various language modeling datasets (including chat and packed formats), configures data loaders and batch samplers, sets up evaluation metrics, and integrates training, validation, testing, and inference pipelines with text generation utilities.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to efficiently fine‑tune large Megatron GPT language models on custom corpora for downstream NLP tasks such as instruction following or chat generation, leveraging the NeMo framework’s scalable training and evaluation capabilities.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "GPT", "supervised fine-tuning", "language modeling", "dataset blending", "chat dataset", "packed dataset", "data loader", "metric", "text generation", "prediction", "NeMo", "NLP", "PyTorch Lightning"], "summary_hash": "62545ed95de7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:35:30+00:00"}
