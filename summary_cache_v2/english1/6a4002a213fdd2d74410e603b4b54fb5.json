{"summary": "Utility module offering helper functions for managing distributed graph partition data in DGL. It includes routines to read and write node and edge feature files, retrieve partition metadata such as node/edge types, feature name mappings, ID ranges, and GNID ranges, map partition IDs to process ranks, and capture memory usage snapshots. The functions serve as I/O and bookkeeping support for preparing and handling graph partitions in distributed training pipelines.", "business_intent": "Facilitate efficient preprocessing, storage, and retrieval of large-scale graph partition information and associated features to enable scalable distributed graph learning and training workflows.", "keywords": ["DGL", "distributed graph partitioning", "graph I/O utilities", "node features", "edge features", "metadata handling", "partition ID mapping", "memory snapshot", "pyarrow", "numpy", "logging"], "summary_hash": "32479e2db0ff", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:59:21+00:00"}
