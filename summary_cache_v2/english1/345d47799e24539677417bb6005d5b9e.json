{"summary": "A utility script that runs a minimal transformer training workload using the Accelerate library and records the peak memory consumption via PyTorch's memory tracing facilities. It sets up data loading, tokenization, a simple model, optimizer and scheduler, and wraps the training loop in a context manager that captures allocation statistics, supporting multiple hardware backends (GPU, MLU, NPU, XPU, etc.).", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to quickly evaluate and compare the memory footprint of model training across different devices, facilitating resource planning, hardware selection, and performance optimization for large‑scale NLP workloads.", "keywords": ["memory profiling", "peak memory usage", "PyTorch tracing", "Accelerate library", "transformer training", "hardware backends", "GPU", "MLU", "NPU", "XPU", "data loading", "tokenization", "optimizer", "scheduler", "benchmarking"], "summary_hash": "c77b7f2fa105", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:20:11+00:00"}
