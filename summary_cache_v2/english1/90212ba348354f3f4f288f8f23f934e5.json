{"summary": "Implements a graph‑based decoder that leverages a token language model to perform decoding and forced alignment. Supports multiple graph topologies (default, compact, shared_blank, minimal) with optional self‑loops and allows explicit configuration of parameters, overriding any external config.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible, configurable token‑level language model decoding for applications such as speech or text processing, providing both standard decoding and precise forced alignment capabilities.", "keywords": ["token language model", "graph decoder", "decoding", "forced alignment", "topology selection", "self‑loops", "configuration", "parameter override", "speech recognition", "text processing"], "summary_hash": "2ab8844c0dee", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:26:35+00:00"}
