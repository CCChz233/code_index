{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that generates images conditioned on both textual and visual prompts. It encodes image and text inputs into latent representations, applies dual attention to combine them, denoises the latents with a conditional UNet and scheduler, and decodes the final latent back to an image.", "business_intent": "Provide a versatile tool for creating customized visual content driven by combined text and image cues, supporting use cases such as advertising creatives, concept art, product mock‑ups, and rapid visual prototyping.", "keywords": ["image generation", "text-to-image", "dual-guided diffusion", "multimodal synthesis", "VQ-VAE", "BERT encoder", "UNet denoiser", "latent diffusion", "content creation", "creative AI"], "summary_hash": "9a9c6858f6b7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:27:05+00:00"}
