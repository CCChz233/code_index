{"summary": "Test suite that validates the automatic construction of diffusion pipelines for various tasks (image‑to‑image, inpainting, text‑to‑image, and ControlNet). It checks that pipelines can be built from pretrained components, that the auto‑selection logic matches explicit pipeline classes, and that integration scenarios work correctly.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and stability of the library's high‑level auto‑pipeline API so developers can reliably create and use diffusion pipelines without manually selecting specific classes.", "keywords": ["auto pipeline", "diffusion models", "image2image", "inpainting", "text2image", "controlnet", "integration testing", "unittest", "pretrained models", "pipeline mapping"], "summary_hash": "08f7924f7031", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:45:58+00:00"}
