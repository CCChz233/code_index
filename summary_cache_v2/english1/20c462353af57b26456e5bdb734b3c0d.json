{"summary": "The module contains a suite of unit tests that validate the functionality of an encoder‑decoder CTC speech recognition model using byte‑pair encoding. Tests cover dataset preparation, model construction, forward computation, decoding configuration, vocabulary modification, and saving/restoring model artifacts, aided by a small helper for model creation.", "business_intent": "Provide automated verification of the NeMo ASR CTC BPE model to guarantee its correctness and stability during development and deployment of speech recognition solutions.", "keywords": ["unit tests", "speech recognition", "CTC", "byte-pair encoding", "encoder-decoder", "model initialization", "forward pass", "decoding", "vocabulary update", "checkpoint", "NeMo", "ASR"], "summary_hash": "b4a9124e5192", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:28:45+00:00"}
