{"summary": "Implements an end‑to‑end variational network for accelerated MRI reconstruction. The model combines a learned coil‑sensitivity estimator with a convolutional refinement network, arranged in multiple cascades that alternate between image refinement and data‑consistency enforcement, ultimately converting undersampled k‑space data into a high‑quality image estimate.", "business_intent": "Enable faster MRI scans by reconstructing high‑fidelity images from incomplete k‑space measurements, supporting clinical workflows and research that require rapid, accurate imaging.", "keywords": ["MRI reconstruction", "variational network", "end‑to‑end", "coil sensitivity estimation", "refinement network", "cascaded architecture", "data consistency", "undersampled k‑space", "deep learning", "fastMRI"], "summary_hash": "1bcc21c370f6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:19:47+00:00"}
