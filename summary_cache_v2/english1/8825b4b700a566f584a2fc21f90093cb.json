{"summary": "The module implements a chaos‑game based fractal generator that repeatedly applies random affine transformations to points, accumulating the results into an image. It also provides a generic vector class for geometric calculations and a spline class supporting B‑splines and NURBS creation, evaluation, and inspection, along with auxiliary helper routines.", "business_intent": "To showcase and benchmark fractal rendering techniques and geometric primitives for educational or performance‑testing purposes, enabling developers to explore chaotic fractal generation and spline manipulation within a single demo package.", "keywords": ["chaos game", "fractal generation", "affine transformation", "vector mathematics", "B‑spline", "NURBS", "graphics benchmark", "random geometry", "geometric utilities"], "summary_hash": "ecdcf124f219", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:20:20+00:00"}
