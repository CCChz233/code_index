{"summary": "The class implements a Von Mises kernel that transforms orientation patches into a higher‑dimensional embedding using a set of supplied coefficients. It stores the patch size and coefficient list, and when called it computes the kernel parameters and applies them to each input patch, producing a tensor with an expanded channel dimension.", "business_intent": "Enable differentiable orientation‑based feature encoding for computer‑vision models, facilitating tasks such as texture analysis, pattern recognition, or any pipeline that requires a compact yet expressive representation of angular data.", "keywords": ["Von Mises", "kernel", "embedding", "orientation", "patch", "coefficients", "torch", "deep learning", "feature extraction"], "summary_hash": "c78740c2649e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:42:18+00:00"}
