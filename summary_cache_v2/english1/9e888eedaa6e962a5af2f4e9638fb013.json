{"summary": "The module implements a backend that coordinates a swarm of language‑model inference services for the Optimum benchmarking framework. It loads model configurations, prepares input data, and dispatches text‑generation requests—either singly or in batches—using asynchronous calls to the LLMSwarm library and Hugging Face inference endpoints. A dedicated configuration dataclass validates and stores all swarm‑specific options.", "business_intent": "Enable users to efficiently benchmark and compare the performance of multiple LLM inference services at scale, providing a flexible and configurable solution for performance testing and optimization.", "keywords": ["LLM", "swarm", "benchmarking", "inference", "asynchronous", "batch processing", "configuration", "Hugging Face", "LLMSwarm", "Optimum", "backend", "text generation"], "summary_hash": "3c59173f7cd2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:33:19+00:00"}
