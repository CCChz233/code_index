{"summary": "Implements the infrastructure for gathering code‑coverage information while running Ansible integration tests. It defines handlers that create appropriate inventories, resolve host profiles, check whether coverage collection is enabled, and orchestrate the setup and teardown of temporary environments on both POSIX and Windows targets. A manager class tracks the coverage configuration and state across test runs, while utility getters expose type mappings.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable mechanism that automatically configures, activates, and cleans up code‑coverage collection for integration test playbooks across multiple platforms, ensuring accurate coverage metrics without manual intervention.", "keywords": ["code coverage", "integration testing", "Ansible", "host inventory", "POSIX", "Windows", "environment setup", "teardown", "configuration handler", "coverage manager", "temporary files", "playbook execution", "host profiles", "provisioning"], "summary_hash": "a35235125a6b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:56:17+00:00"}
