{"summary": "This module defines a graph‑based implementation of the RNN‑Transducer loss using the k2 weighted finite‑state transducer library. It provides a base class for graph transducer losses and a concrete loss class that exposes the internal alignment grid, temporal and unit schemas, and supports state relabeling to enable flexible and efficient loss computation for speech models.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑performance, configurable training of speech recognition models (especially RNN‑Transducer architectures) within the NVIDIA NeMo framework by leveraging k2 graph operations for accurate loss calculation.", "keywords": ["RNN-Transducer", "loss", "k2", "WFST", "graph", "alignment grid", "speech recognition", "NeMo", "torch", "float32 context"], "summary_hash": "54eefc7248b3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:13:41+00:00"}
