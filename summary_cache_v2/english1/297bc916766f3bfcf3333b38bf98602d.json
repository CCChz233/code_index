{"summary": "The ClassicalTransport class provides a unified, object‑oriented interface for computing classical plasma transport coefficients—electrical resistivity, thermoelectric conductivity, electron and ion thermal conductivities, and electron and ion viscosities—based on supplied plasma state parameters (temperatures, densities, ion species, charge state, magnetic field strength and orientation). It supports multiple theoretical models (Braginskii, Spitzer‑Harm, Ji‑Held), handles the evaluation of Coulomb logarithms and Hall parameters, and lazily evaluates the requested coefficients while storing the input data for reuse.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and simulation tools to obtain consistent, model‑dependent transport properties for magnetized or unmagnetized plasmas without manually implementing the underlying kinetic‑theory formulas, thereby simplifying plasma‑physics calculations and supporting comparative studies of different classical transport models.", "keywords": ["plasma", "classical transport", "resistivity", "thermal conductivity", "viscosity", "Braginskii", "Spitzer‑Harm", "Ji‑Held", "Coulomb logarithm", "Hall parameter", "magnetized plasma"], "summary_hash": "093f071fa192", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:03:38+00:00"}
