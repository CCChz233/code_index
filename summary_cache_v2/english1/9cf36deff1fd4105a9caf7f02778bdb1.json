{"summary": "Implements a token‑level classifier that restores punctuation and capitalization in raw text, typically ASR output. It builds on a pretrained BERT‑style language model and adds two multilayer perceptron heads—one for punctuation tags and one for capitalization tags. The class manages data loading, label handling, metric calculation, and provides training, validation, testing, and inference pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enhance speech‑to‑text pipelines by automatically adding proper punctuation and capitalization, improving readability and enabling downstream NLP tasks such as translation, summarization, and information extraction.", "keywords": ["punctuation restoration", "capitalization prediction", "ASR post‑processing", "BERT", "multilayer perceptron heads", "token classification", "NeMo", "NLP model", "inference", "training dataset"], "summary_hash": "4ce6f87645b9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:09:52+00:00"}
