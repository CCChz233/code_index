{"summary": "Implements a TensorFlow Keras layer that performs graph convolution on heterogeneous graphs by applying separate sub-modules for each relation type, gathering destination node features, and merging them using a configurable aggregation method. Includes a helper to obtain the appropriate aggregation operation.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable component for building heterogeneous graph neural networks in TensorFlow, simplifying multi-relation message passing and feature aggregation.", "keywords": ["heterogeneous graph", "graph convolution", "TensorFlow", "Keras layer", "edge type handling", "feature aggregation", "neural network", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "9d6d987d6bec", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:42:32+00:00"}
