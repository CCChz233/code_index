{"summary": "Defines a Heun-based discrete diffusion scheduler that computes timesteps from linear or scaled‑linear beta schedules (or custom betas), optionally converts betas to alternative sigma parametrizations (Karras, exponential, beta), and performs second‑order Heun integration to update samples during denoising. It handles timestep spacing, step offsets, prediction type handling, input scaling, noise addition, and clipping for numerical stability. Accompanying a lightweight output container class, it returns the next sample and the model's estimate of the original clean image for each step.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible and numerically stable sampling mechanism for diffusion models that leverages Heun's integration to improve generation quality and speed across various sigma parametrizations.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "Heun integration", "beta schedule", "sigma conversion", "Karras sigmas", "exponential sigmas", "beta sigmas", "timestep spacing", "step offset", "prediction type", "sample clipping", "output container"], "summary_hash": "4477765f4d3f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:12:45+00:00"}
