{"summary": "Contains unit tests that verify the functionality of adapter-related mixins and linear adapter components within the NeMo framework. The tests cover exposure of supported adapter types, validation of adapter classes, state reset behavior, configuration parsing, dropout handling, weight initialization, placement of normalization layers, and selection of adapter strategies.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of adapter integration in NeMo models, enabling reliable fine‑tuning and modular extension of neural modules.", "keywords": ["adapter mixin", "linear adapter", "unit testing", "NeMo", "configuration parsing", "dropout", "weight initialization", "normalization layer", "adapter validation", "state reset"], "summary_hash": "9e03338f736f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:54:02+00:00"}
