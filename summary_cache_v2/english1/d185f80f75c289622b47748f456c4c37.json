{"summary": "The module implements an end‑to‑end training pipeline for personalising the Flux diffusion model using the DreamBooth approach with LoRA adapters. It defines a custom flow‑matching scheduler, dataset classes for loading instance and class images together with their prompts, and a handler for managing token embeddings. The script orchestrates model loading, prompt encoding, distributed training via Accelerate, validation logging, and model card generation, providing utilities for saving and uploading the fine‑tuned model.", "business_intent": "Allow organisations and developers to customise a state‑of‑the‑art image generation model for their own visual concepts, enabling brand‑specific or proprietary content creation while leveraging efficient LoRA fine‑tuning and scalable distributed training.", "keywords": ["DreamBooth", "LoRA", "Flux", "diffusion model", "fine‑tuning", "custom scheduler", "token embeddings", "distributed training", "Accelerate", "image generation", "model card", "HuggingFace"], "summary_hash": "f4455a4d4ab6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:57:31+00:00"}
