{"summary": "A collection of unit tests that validate the fallback logic of the Litellm routing component. The tests simulate failures and edge cases for asynchronous, synchronous, streaming, and embedding requests, as well as custom cooldown periods, usage‑based routing, and model‑specific cost handling, using mock objects and a custom logger to verify that the router correctly switches to alternative providers.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and resilience of the LLM routing layer by confirming that fallback mechanisms activate appropriately under various failure conditions, thereby maintaining uninterrupted service for downstream applications.", "keywords": ["litellm", "router", "fallback", "async", "sync", "streaming", "embeddings", "custom logger", "pytest", "mock", "cooldown", "usage based routing", "unit testing"], "summary_hash": "6210ce17c5ec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:29:48+00:00"}
