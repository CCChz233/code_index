{"summary": "The corpus package defines abstract interfaces and concrete implementations for handling collections of text documents and subject taxonomies. It supports loading documents from directories or TSV files, combining multiple corpora, limiting size, and applying lazy transformations. Subject vocabularies can be read from multilingual CSV/TSV files or SKOS/RDF sources, indexed by IDs and URIs, and exported back to SKOS. The module unifies these operations under a common iterable corpus API.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, language‑aware foundation for annotation and classification systems to ingest, manipulate, and export document and subject data in various standard formats, facilitating downstream machine‑learning pipelines and knowledge‑graph integration.", "keywords": ["corpus", "document collection", "subject taxonomy", "SKOS", "TSV", "CSV", "multilingual", "iterator", "combination", "lazy transformation", "indexing", "export"], "summary_hash": "5a57f563a458", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:37:14+00:00"}
