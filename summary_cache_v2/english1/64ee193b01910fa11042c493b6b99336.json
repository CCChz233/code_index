{"summary": "This module supplies utilities for constructing blockwise operations on Dask arrays. It builds high‑level graphs that apply a user‑provided function to each array chunk, handling broadcasting, index alignment, and chunk metadata so that the computation can be executed lazily and in parallel across many workers.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, out‑of‑core array processing by allowing developers to express complex element‑wise or reduction logic as blockwise tasks, thereby improving performance, memory efficiency, and ease of parallel execution in data‑intensive applications.", "keywords": ["Dask", "array", "parallel computation", "high-level graph", "chunked processing", "lazy evaluation", "broadcasting", "index alignment", "task scheduling", "blockwise computation"], "summary_hash": "50656697e745", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:17:05+00:00"}
