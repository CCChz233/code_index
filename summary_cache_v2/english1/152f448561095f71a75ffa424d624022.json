{"summary": "The module is an example script that demonstrates how to fine‑tune a Hugging Face sequence‑classification model in a distributed, multi‑process setting using the Accelerate library. It handles dataset loading, tokenization, data loading, optimizer and scheduler setup, and runs training and evaluation while aggregating metrics across processes.", "business_intent": "Provide a reference implementation for scalable, multi‑GPU/CPU training of text classification models, illustrating proper metric handling and synchronization in a distributed environment.", "keywords": ["accelerate", "distributed training", "multi‑process", "metrics aggregation", "Hugging Face Transformers", "sequence classification", "tokenization", "data loader", "PyTorch", "GPU"], "summary_hash": "7d51b630f197", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:16:56+00:00"}
