{"summary": "The script merges Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights into a base Stable Diffusion model using NVIDIA NeMo utilities. It loads a pretrained diffusion model, applies the LoRA checkpoint to the model parameters, optionally modifies the model configuration, and saves a new checkpoint that contains the combined weights for downstream inference or deployment.", "business_intent": "Provide a convenient tool for consolidating LoRA fine‑tuning updates into a single, self‑contained diffusion model checkpoint, simplifying model distribution and inference without requiring separate LoRA adapters.", "keywords": ["LoRA", "Stable Diffusion", "model merging", "checkpoint", "NeMo", "PyTorch", "inference", "configuration modification", "diffusion model"], "summary_hash": "72a158984374", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:48:29+00:00"}
