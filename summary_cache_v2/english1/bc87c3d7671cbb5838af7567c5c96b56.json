It's a test class for QASM3 exporter temporary cases with bad parameterisation. The docstring says: Test functionality that is not what we want, but needed while definition of custom gates with parameterisation does not work correctly. These tests are modified versions of those marked with requires_fixed_parameterisation decorator, and whole class can be deleted once those are fixed. See gh-7335.\n\nMethod summaries: each test is a simple helper test for various features: basis gates, custom gate with params bound main call, multiple switches don't clash on dummy, no include, switch clbit, switch expr target, switch multiple cases to same block, switch nested in if, switch register, switch with default, teleportation, unusual conditions.\n\nThus class responsibility: a collection of unit tests for QASM3 exporter handling of various circuit features, especially focusing on temporary workarounds for parameterisation issues in custom gates. It validates correct export of basis gates, custom gates with bound parameters, switch statements, teleportation circuits, etc., under current broken parameterisation.\n\nBusiness intent: Ensure that the QASM3 exporter continues to produce correct output for a range of circuit constructs despite known limitations in custom gate parameter handling, providing regression safety until the underlying bug is fixed.\n\nKeywords: testing, QASM3 exporter, quantum circuit, custom gates, parameterisation, switch statements, teleportation, regression, temporary workaround, quantum computing, Qiskit.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed to ensure no method names verbatim.
