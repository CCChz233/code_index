{"summary": "The module supplies a comprehensive set of Bitcoin cryptographic utilities, covering hierarchical deterministic key derivation, address and script creation for multiple output types (including P2PKH, P2SH‑P2WPKH, native P2WPKH, timelocked P2WSH, and watch‑only variants), WIF handling, and transaction signing. It also includes helper tools such as a lightweight LRU cache, a class‑level property descriptor, and a function to identify script types.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to construct, sign, and manage Bitcoin transactions across a wide range of script formats—especially advanced cases like time‑locked and watch‑only outputs—while simplifying key management and providing auxiliary utilities for efficient caching and class attribute handling.", "keywords": ["Bitcoin", "cryptography", "key derivation", "BIP32", "BIP44", "address generation", "script generation", "P2PKH", "P2SH-P2WPKH", "P2WPKH", "timelocked P2WSH", "watch‑only", "transaction signing", "WIF", "LRU cache", "classproperty", "script detection"], "summary_hash": "5115fc6642fd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:22:32+00:00"}
