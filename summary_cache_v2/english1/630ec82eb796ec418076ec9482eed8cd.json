{"summary": "Manages data‑parallel distribution across a one‑dimensional device mesh, allowing the user to specify an existing mesh, a list of devices, or let the system auto‑detect available devices. It constructs the mesh, distributes datasets accordingly, and provides access to the resulting data, tensor, and variable layouts.", "business_intent": "Facilitate scalable parallel training or inference by abstracting device topology and automatically handling data placement, enabling developers to leverage multiple accelerators without manual distribution logic.", "keywords": ["data parallelism", "device mesh", "distributed dataset", "layout management", "tensor layout", "variable layout", "multi‑device", "automatic device detection", "parallel computing"], "summary_hash": "549dfa1a65f3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:28:47+00:00"}
