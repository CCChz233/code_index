{"summary": "The module implements a template‑matching framework used during quantum circuit transpilation. It discovers occurrences of a given sub‑circuit pattern within a larger circuit by exploring forward and backward graph traversals across all possible qubit‑clbit mappings, aggregates the strongest (maximal) matches, and applies cost‑aware rewrites to produce an optimized directed‑acyclic‑graph representation of the circuit.", "business_intent": "Enable automated circuit optimization by replacing identified sub‑circuits with more efficient equivalents, thereby reducing gate count, depth, and execution error rates in quantum programs.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "transpilation", "template matching", "pattern detection", "optimization", "forward traversal", "backward traversal", "maximal matches", "substitution", "DAG", "qubit mapping", "cost assessment"], "summary_hash": "6cc20351ae57", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:09:05+00:00"}
