{"summary": "Defines a hierarchy of abstract syntax tree (AST) node classes and utilities for parsing, validating, and constructing DynamoDB expressions, especially update statements. Includes mechanisms for depth‑first traversal, attribute path handling, clause aggregation, and value encapsulation, enabling the mock DynamoDB implementation to interpret and render complex expression syntax.", "business_intent": "Provide the underlying infrastructure that allows the Moto DynamoDB mock to understand and process DynamoDB expression language (e.g., SET, ADD, REMOVE, DELETE clauses), ensuring that client requests are correctly parsed, validated, and transformed into executable operations on mocked data.", "keywords": ["AST", "DynamoDB", "expression parsing", "update expression", "attribute path", "node hierarchy", "traversal", "validation", "mock service", "clause handling"], "summary_hash": "2e115d6f08d7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:04:32+00:00"}
