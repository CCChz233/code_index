{"summary": "Implements a multi‑scale diarization decoder that processes speaker embeddings and acoustic features through configurable CNN and LSTM layers across several temporal scales. It computes context vectors (cosine similarity or element‑wise product) and estimates attention‑based scale weights using a selectable weighting scheme, producing refined diarization outputs capable of handling overlapping speech. The module is parameterized by max speakers, hidden size, LSTM depth, dropout, CNN channels, embedding dimension, number of scales, weight clamping, and convolution repetitions.", "business_intent": "Provides a plug‑in neural component for speech processing pipelines that require accurate, overlap‑aware speaker diarization, such as meeting transcription, call analytics, or multimedia indexing, by delivering a learnable multi‑scale decoding mechanism that improves over traditional clustering diarizers.", "keywords": ["speaker diarization", "multi‑scale decoding", "overlap handling", "CNN", "LSTM", "attention weighting", "cosine similarity", "element‑wise product", "neural network", "audio processing"], "summary_hash": "ef37029458f7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:07:40+00:00"}
