{"summary": "The module defines a suite of regression evaluation metrics for deep learning models, built on a common base that validates inputs, supports optional NaN handling, and aggregates results across batches with configurable reduction (mean, sum, etc.). Implemented metrics include absolute error, squared error, root‑mean‑square error, peak signal‑to‑noise ratio, structural similarity (SSIM) and its multi‑scale variant, each capable of handling N‑dimensional tensors and providing optional counts of valid elements.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable quantitative assessment of model predictions in medical imaging and other regression tasks by offering standardized, cumulative metrics that can be integrated into training and validation pipelines.", "keywords": ["regression metrics", "mean absolute error", "mean squared error", "root mean squared error", "peak signal-to-noise ratio", "structural similarity index", "multi-scale SSIM", "tensor reduction", "NaN handling", "cumulative evaluation", "PyTorch", "medical imaging"], "summary_hash": "1aea32e28713", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:12:37+00:00"}
