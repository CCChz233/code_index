{"summary": "This module defines the Flax implementation of an Euler discrete scheduler for diffusion models. It includes a dataclass that stores the scheduler’s internal state (timesteps, step sizes, etc.) and a scheduler class that manages beta schedules, timestep handling, noise addition, input scaling, and the reverse diffusion stepping logic using JAX/Flax tensors. The scheduler integrates configuration utilities and supports checkpoint loading and saving.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable, configurable scheduler component that enables efficient reverse diffusion steps in Flax‑based diffusion pipelines, facilitating model inference and fine‑tuning while handling state management and checkpoint persistence.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "Euler discrete", "scheduler", "Flax", "JAX", "beta schedule", "timestep", "noise addition", "state management", "configuration", "checkpoint"], "summary_hash": "2859f47517c4", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:12:20+00:00"}
