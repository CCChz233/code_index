{"summary": "This module implements a generic event‑hook mechanism for the instructor framework. It defines hook points representing stages of a completion workflow (e.g., argument preparation, response receipt, error occurrence, parsing failure) and provides a Hooks class that lets callers register callbacks, invoke them at the appropriate moments, and safely handle any exceptions.", "business_intent": "The hook system enables developers to extend and monitor AI completion pipelines without altering core logic, allowing custom logging, metrics collection, response transformation, or error handling to be injected at key stages, thereby improving observability, flexibility, and integration capabilities in applications that rely on the instructor library.", "keywords": ["hook system", "event callbacks", "completion workflow", "extensibility", "observer pattern", "error handling", "parsing", "response processing", "callback registration", "AI completion", "instrumentation"], "summary_hash": "4c71cd9c883f", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:32:21+00:00"}
