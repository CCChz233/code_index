{"summary": "The module defines utilities and a transformer that walk a Lark parse tree produced from Cairo source code and construct an abstract syntax tree composed of Cairo type objects. It manages identifiers, comma‑separated collections, and the various type syntaxes supported by Cairo (named types, code offsets, felt literals, pointers, structs, tuples), while preserving source location and handling parsing errors.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable parsing of Cairo language constructs within the StarkNet tooling chain, turning textual code into structured type representations for downstream compilation, analysis, or code generation steps.", "keywords": ["Cairo", "parser", "Lark", "AST", "type transformation", "comma-separated list", "identifier handling", "struct", "tuple", "pointer", "code offset", "felt", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "6abdaaf31a7f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:46:44+00:00"}
