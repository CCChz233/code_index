{"summary": "The module implements a controller that combines CLIP image embeddings with a Stable Diffusion pipeline to mix multiple source images into a single coherent output. It prepares latent representations, manages freezing and unfreezing of model components, and applies CLIP‑based conditional guidance during diffusion sampling.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible AI tool for creative professionals and marketers to generate novel visual content by blending existing images, enabling rapid prototyping, brand asset creation, and artistic exploration using state‑of‑the‑art diffusion models.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion", "CLIP", "image mixing", "latent manipulation", "conditional guidance", "AI art generation", "diffusion pipeline", "content creation", "gradient control", "spherical distance loss"], "summary_hash": "9f201c52a54a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:59:29+00:00"}
