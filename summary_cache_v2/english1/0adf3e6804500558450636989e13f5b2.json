{"summary": "A test module aimed at validating the rendering of different water‑quality advection schemes (finite‑difference, modified method‑of‑characteristics, and TVD) by importing the corresponding model classes. The defined test functions are presently unused, indicating incomplete or placeholder test coverage.", "business_intent": "Provide automated verification that advection models generate correct visual representations for water‑quality simulations, supporting model reliability and quality assurance.", "keywords": ["water quality", "advection", "finite difference", "modified MOC", "TVD", "testing", "rendering", "visualization", "model validation"], "summary_hash": "4629f08eadaa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:56:06+00:00"}
