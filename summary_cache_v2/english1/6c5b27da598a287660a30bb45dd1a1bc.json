{"summary": "The module provides a collection of immutable data model classes that represent various static and dynamic metadata of quantum backends, including configuration details, calibration properties, operational status, job status, and pulse defaults. These models support validation, attribute access, equality checks, HTML rendering, and JSON‑compatible serialization/deserialization, ensuring consistent handling of backend information across Qiskit.", "business_intent": "Standardize and simplify the representation, validation, and exchange of quantum backend metadata so that users and services can reliably query, store, and transmit configuration, performance, status, and pulse configuration data within the Qiskit ecosystem.", "keywords": ["quantum backend", "configuration", "properties", "status", "job status", "pulse defaults", "data model", "serialization", "validation", "Qiskit", "immutable"], "summary_hash": "e5957ddbe98f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:09:45+00:00"}
