{"summary": "The file defines a set of classes that model various network protocol headers and packets, providing methods for parsing, constructing, and manipulating these structures. It includes a base packet buffer class for low‑level byte handling, utilities for managing protocol layers, and specific implementations for protocols such as Ethernet, ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and others. The module also defines custom exceptions and helper functions for packet processing.", "business_intent": "To enable developers to programmatically create, dissect, and modify network packets across multiple protocol layers, supporting tasks such as network testing, security analysis, and protocol implementation.", "keywords": ["network protocol modeling", "packet parsing", "packet construction", "protocol layers", "header manipulation", "checksum calculation", "network security", "testing tools"], "summary_hash": "2a8b8c4a48f2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:09:52+00:00"}
