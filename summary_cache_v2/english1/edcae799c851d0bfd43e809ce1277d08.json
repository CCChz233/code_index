{"summary": "Implements a binary cross‑entropy loss calculator that measures the discrepancy between true binary labels and model predictions. It can interpret predictions as raw logits or probabilities, apply optional label smoothing, operate along a specified feature axis, and aggregate the per‑sample losses using configurable reduction strategies.", "business_intent": "Provides a configurable loss metric for training and evaluating binary classification models, allowing developers to integrate accurate error signals into optimization pipelines.", "keywords": ["binary crossentropy", "loss function", "logits", "probabilities", "label smoothing", "reduction", "Keras", "deep learning", "binary classification", "gradient descent"], "summary_hash": "ab7cf6bfe561", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:49:37+00:00"}
