{"summary": "A configurable dense block that stacks a series of convolutional or residual units, allowing specification of spatial dimensionality, channel counts, dilations, kernel size, number of units, activation, normalization, dropout, and bias. The block constructs each layer via a helper that can be overridden to customize the internal composition.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to quickly assemble deep, densely connected convolutional modules for neural network models, improving feature reuse and model depth while offering flexibility for various application domains such as computer vision or medical imaging.", "keywords": ["dense block", "convolutional layers", "residual unit", "configurable architecture", "activation", "normalization", "dropout", "dilation", "kernel size", "multi-dimensional"], "summary_hash": "449dc3d72fa5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:49:23+00:00"}
