{"summary": "This module provides the core client implementations for the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) in Python. It defines classes that manage token acquisition, caching, and refresh for both confidential and public client applications, supporting multiple OAuth flows such as client credentials, on‑behalf‑of, interactive user login, and device code. The module also handles request throttling, telemetry, region detection, and optional CCS routing metadata for correlation.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to integrate Azure Active Directory authentication into their applications, enabling secure acquisition of access tokens for calling Microsoft APIs or other protected resources, while abstracting the complexities of OAuth flows and token management.", "keywords": ["authentication", "OAuth2", "Azure AD", "MSAL", "token acquisition", "confidential client", "public client", "client credentials", "on-behalf-of", "device code flow", "interactive login", "token cache", "telemetry", "request throttling", "region detection", "CCS routing"], "summary_hash": "b6f88224e65f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:06:15+00:00"}
