{"summary": "Provides low‑level utilities for reading and handling raw byte streams from many file systems. It parses human‑readable size specifications, opens files via fsspec, supports optional compression formats, and enables extraction of specific byte ranges using block reads. The functionality is wrapped with Dask’s delayed execution and tokenization to allow lazy, reproducible, and distributed access to binary data.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, efficient, and transparent byte‑level data access in distributed computing workflows, simplifying handling of compressed files and partial reads across heterogeneous storage backends.", "keywords": ["dask", "bytes", "file I/O", "fsspec", "compression", "lazy evaluation", "delayed", "tokenization", "distributed", "block reads", "byte ranges", "storage backends"], "summary_hash": "fa53113b0f78", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:26:59+00:00"}
