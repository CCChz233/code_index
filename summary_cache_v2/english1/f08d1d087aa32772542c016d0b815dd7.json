{"summary": "The script prepares audio and transcript data for CTC‑based speech recognition training. It loads audio files, applies normalization to Russian text (including abbreviation expansion and number conversion), optionally splits long utterances, runs a pretrained ASR model to obtain alignments, and writes the processed segments for downstream CTC segmentation pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient creation of high‑quality, aligned audio‑text datasets for training and evaluating CTC speech recognition models, particularly for Russian language applications.", "keywords": ["audio preprocessing", "speech recognition", "CTC segmentation", "text normalization", "Russian language", "parallel processing", "sox", "NeMo", "alignment generation", "data preparation"], "summary_hash": "442a414935b6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:24:43+00:00"}
