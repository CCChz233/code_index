{"summary": "Provides a reusable, high‑performance tool for transforming collections of raster‑like layers onto a new grid. The first invocation builds a compiled routine based on the chosen aggregation method, after which subsequent calls reuse the compiled code, eliminating JIT overhead.", "business_intent": "Accelerate large‑scale spatial or temporal data workflows—such as climate, remote‑sensing, or GIS analyses—by efficiently regridding many similar datasets with selectable statistical reductions.", "keywords": ["regridding", "layer aggregation", "JIT compilation", "performance optimization", "spatial data", "grid transformation", "mean", "sum", "median", "mode", "maximum", "minimum"], "summary_hash": "1735e55bf8a5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:31:17+00:00"}
