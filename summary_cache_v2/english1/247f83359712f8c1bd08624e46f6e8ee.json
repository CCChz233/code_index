{"summary": "A test suite that validates the behavior of a timeout decorator, confirming that wrapped functions are interrupted after the configured duration and that normal execution proceeds when within limits. It uses internal helpers to assess outcomes and simulate operations with and without artificial delays.", "business_intent": "Ensure the timeout mechanism works reliably to prevent excessively long executions, thereby improving system stability and performance.", "keywords": ["timeout", "decorator", "unit test", "validation", "performance", "reliability", "execution limit", "delay simulation"], "summary_hash": "bdd78500dc38", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:13:37+00:00"}
