{"summary": "This module implements a hard‑negative sampling utility for object detection models. It provides a base sampler and a concrete implementation that selects a fixed number of samples per image, preserving a configurable proportion of positive examples while choosing the most difficult negative predictions (those with the highest confidence scores) from a larger candidate pool, guaranteeing a minimum number of negatives. The sampler integrates with PyTorch tensors and is adapted from the nnDetection framework.", "business_intent": "Enable more effective classifier training in detection pipelines by focusing on challenging negative examples, thereby reducing false‑positive rates and improving model robustness, especially in medical imaging applications.", "keywords": ["hard negative sampling", "object detection", "classifier training", "positive fraction", "negative selection", "torch", "MONAI", "nnDetection adaptation", "false positives", "sampling strategy"], "summary_hash": "4fa768c22345", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:27:02+00:00"}
