{"summary": "The module defines a collection of helper utilities that calculate the probabilities and consequences of various pregnancy‑related conditions and events, such as hemorrhage, ectopic pregnancy, gestational diabetes, hypertension, placental complications, pre‑eclampsia, preterm labor, and different types of abortion and stillbirth. These functions are intended to be used by a larger simulation framework to assess maternal and fetal health outcomes.", "business_intent": "To support a population‑level health model by providing deterministic or stochastic estimates of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality associated with pregnancy complications, enabling scenario analysis and policy evaluation.", "keywords": ["pregnancy", "maternal health", "fetal outcomes", "stillbirth", "hemorrhage", "ectopic pregnancy", "gestational diabetes", "hypertension", "abortion", "anaemia", "placenta praevia", "placental abruption", "pre‑eclampsia", "preterm labour", "spontaneous abortion", "health simulation"], "summary_hash": "97ea2c5c5d58", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:50:34+00:00"}
