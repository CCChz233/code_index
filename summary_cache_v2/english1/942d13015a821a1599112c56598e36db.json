{"summary": "Defines a pulse‑level acquisition instruction that initiates the analog‑to‑digital conversion on a readout channel, records raw samples for a given duration, processes the samples with a kernel and a discriminator, and stores the resulting classified outcomes in specified memory and register slots.", "business_intent": "Enable precise, programmable measurement of qubits on quantum hardware by exposing low‑level acquisition control and post‑processing capabilities, allowing developers to integrate custom readout pipelines into quantum circuits and experiments.", "keywords": ["acquisition", "measurement", "ADC", "kernel", "discriminator", "memory slot", "register slot", "pulse", "quantum hardware", "Qiskit", "instruction", "readout", "integration", "classification"], "summary_hash": "80f222036813", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:04:48+00:00"}
