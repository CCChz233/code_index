{"summary": "This module provides a framework for evaluating resource‑based compliance checks within an infrastructure graph. It includes a core solver that manages node processing, result collection, and optional concurrent execution, and specialized solvers that assess whether a resource exists or does not exist by running defined operations and interpreting their outcomes.", "business_intent": "Automate security and policy validation of infrastructure‑as‑code by determining the presence or absence of specific resources in a deployment graph, enabling scalable and reliable compliance checking.", "keywords": ["resource solver", "infrastructure graph", "compliance checks", "existence validation", "non‑existence validation", "concurrent execution", "IaC security", "policy enforcement", "graph traversal", "automated analysis"], "summary_hash": "b46a931b7d8a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:16:19+00:00"}
