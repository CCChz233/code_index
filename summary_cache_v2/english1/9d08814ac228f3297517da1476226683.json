{"summary": "Coordinates the execution of CORSIKA air‑shower simulations and streams their output directly into the sim_telarray detector simulation, optionally using a multipipe mechanism. It manages configuration objects, generates the necessary run scripts, builds command lines, and provides access to the resulting file names.", "business_intent": "Provide an automated, reproducible workflow for combined cosmic‑ray shower and telescope array simulations, supporting scientific studies that require tightly coupled CORSIKA and sim_telarray runs.", "keywords": ["CORSIKA", "sim_telarray", "multipipe", "air shower simulation", "telescope array", "configuration management", "script generation", "simulation pipeline"], "summary_hash": "d8777246350c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:45:14+00:00"}
