{"summary": "Provides a Clifford operator class that encodes N‑qubit Clifford unitaries via a binary stabilizer/destabilizer tableau. The class supports creation from quantum circuits, Pauli strings, matrix forms, and permutation specifications, and can be converted back into circuits, gate objects, operator instances, or dense matrices. It implements algebraic operations such as composition, tensor product, conjugation, and adjoint, and offers utilities for inspecting individual stabilizer rows and phase information.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient representation, manipulation, and conversion of Clifford operations for quantum computing applications such as circuit synthesis, error‑correction simulation, and fast Clifford‑group calculations within the Qiskit framework.", "keywords": ["Clifford", "stabilizer tableau", "quantum circuit", "Pauli", "unitary", "composition", "tensor product", "adjoint", "conjugation", "matrix representation", "quantum information", "symplectic", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "13df44e3aa88", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:08:33+00:00"}
