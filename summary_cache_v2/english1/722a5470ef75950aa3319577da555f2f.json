{"summary": "The module implements a metric for assessing how faithfully a generated answer reflects the information in the source documents. It builds statements from the source, uses a language model to score each turn, aggregates verdicts, and offers reproducibility checks. An alternative implementation evaluates faithfulness via a hierarchical heterogeneous embedding model, batching text pairs and computing similarity scores. Helper utilities support segmenting inputs.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and data scientists to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of AI‑generated responses in retrieval‑augmented generation or question‑answering systems, ensuring compliance, trustworthiness, and higher user satisfaction.", "keywords": ["faithfulness", "evaluation metric", "RAG", "language model", "embedding similarity", "HHEM", "segmenter", "single‑turn assessment", "reproducibility"], "summary_hash": "ff376e3ff794", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:49:44+00:00"}
