{"summary": "The module defines a Dispersion data container used in MODFLOW 6 simulations to encapsulate molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion parameters for solute transport. It stores effective diffusion coefficients, direction‑dependent longitudinal and transverse dispersivities (including optional vertical components), supports optional advanced 3‑D dispersion calculations, and integrates schema‑based validation and regridding capabilities.", "business_intent": "Enable modelers to configure, validate, and manage dispersion properties consistently within groundwater transport models, facilitating accurate solute transport calculations and seamless integration with MODFLOW 6 package handling and regridding workflows.", "keywords": ["dispersion", "molecular diffusion", "mechanical dispersion", "solute transport", "MODFLOW 6", "effective diffusion coefficient", "longitudinal dispersivity", "transverse dispersivity", "vertical dispersivity", "3D dispersion", "data container", "validation", "regridding", "schema"], "summary_hash": "b56daaa05d2b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:49:31+00:00"}
