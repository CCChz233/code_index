{"summary": "Implements an intensity normalization transform that subtracts a mean (or provided subtrahend) from an image and divides by a standard deviation (or provided divisor). When parameters are absent, it computes mean and std from the input, optionally per channel, and can limit the operation to non‑zero pixels. The output can be cast to a specified data type.", "business_intent": "Standardize image pixel values to reduce intensity variability, facilitating more reliable downstream processing such as computer vision or medical imaging analysis.", "keywords": ["intensity normalization", "mean subtraction", "standard deviation scaling", "channel-wise processing", "non-zero pixel handling", "image preprocessing", "dtype conversion", "data standardization"], "summary_hash": "115f9cd9f280", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:51:39+00:00"}
