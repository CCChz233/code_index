{"summary": "The module implements a command‑line utility for fine‑tuning the Flux diffusion model with DreamBooth using Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It defines dataset abstractions for loading instance and class images together with their textual prompts, handles image preprocessing, tokenization, and prompt encoding, and provides helpers for loading and saving model components, configuring the training loop with Accelerate, and managing LoRA state. The script orchestrates the end‑to‑end training pipeline, including optimizer setup, scheduler configuration, checkpointing, and optional model‑card generation.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and content creators to quickly personalize a state‑of‑the‑art generative model with custom visual concepts, enabling the creation of tailored image generation services or products without extensive model retraining.", "keywords": ["DreamBooth", "LoRA", "Flux", "diffusion model", "fine‑tuning", "custom concepts", "image generation", "accelerate", "HuggingFace", "dataset preprocessing", "model checkpointing"], "summary_hash": "6c7bc47e37db", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:04:44+00:00"}
