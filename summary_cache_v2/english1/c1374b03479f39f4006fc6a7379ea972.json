{"summary": "The module implements a suite of numerical samplers for diffusion‑based generative models, providing a common base sampler that manages sigma schedules and loop initialization, and multiple concrete strategies—Euler, Heun, ancestral, DPMPP, EDM, linear multistep, and single‑step—each offering specific integration rules and correction steps to advance the reverse diffusion process and generate samples from a trained model.", "business_intent": "Supply a flexible, high‑performance library of components that enable developers to construct, train, and deploy diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion for image and video generation within the NVIDIA NeMo ecosystem, accelerating AI product development and research.", "keywords": ["diffusion models", "UNet architecture", "self‑attention", "residual blocks", "timestep embedding", "up‑sampling", "down‑sampling", "mixed‑precision", "checkpointing", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "f80d9900f3d4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:03:44+00:00"}
