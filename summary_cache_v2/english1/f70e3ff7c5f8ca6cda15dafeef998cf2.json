{"summary": "The module defines a collection of neural network layers that down‑sample audio feature sequences for automatic speech recognition. It offers configurable convolutional subsampling (including VGG‑style, stride‑based and depthwise‑stride variants), stacking‑based reduction, and specialized time‑reduction blocks for models such as Squeezeformer. These layers compress the temporal dimension by powers of two, support optional chunking and streaming‑friendly caching, and expose utilities to compute the resulting frame rate.", "business_intent": "Enable faster and more memory‑efficient speech‑to‑text processing by reducing the length of audio feature streams, facilitating real‑time and low‑resource ASR deployments.", "keywords": ["subsampling", "convolutional layer", "speech recognition", "ASR", "temporal reduction", "streaming", "stride", "depthwise convolution", "VGG", "time reduction", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "4d27caca6513", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:15:59+00:00"}
