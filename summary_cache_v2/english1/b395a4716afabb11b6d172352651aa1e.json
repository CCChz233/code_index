{"summary": "The annif.backend package defines the core infrastructure for Annif's automatic subject indexing system. It supplies a registry and factory for backend selection, abstract base classes that standardize initialization, configuration, training, suggestion generation, and status reporting, and a collection of concrete backend implementations (e.g., fastText, TF‑IDF, SVM, ensemble, HTTP, hyperparameter‑tuned, neural‑network, lexical matching, etc.). Supporting utilities such as mixins for text chunking and TF‑IDF vectorization, hyperparameter optimization, and model persistence are also provided, enabling flexible, pluggable annotation pipelines.", "business_intent": "To provide a modular, extensible framework that allows organizations to plug in, train, and operate various machine‑learning and rule‑based models for automatically assigning subject headings to documents, thereby streamlining content classification and discovery processes.", "keywords": ["automatic subject indexing", "backend registry", "machine learning", "ensemble modeling", "fastText", "TF‑IDF", "support vector machine", "hyperparameter tuning", "HTTP integration", "text chunking", "model training", "suggestion generation", "pluggable architecture"], "summary_hash": "501ccc8abdf2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:37:06+00:00"}
