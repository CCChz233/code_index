{"summary": "The module provides a command‑line script that orchestrates supervised fine‑tuning of a causal language model using LoRA adapters. It parses configuration options, loads and tokenizes a dataset, builds a constant‑length training set, configures training arguments, and runs the training loop with accelerator support.", "business_intent": "Allow researchers and engineers to efficiently adapt large language models to specific tasks or domains with reduced computational cost, leveraging parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning techniques.", "keywords": ["fine-tuning", "causal language model", "LoRA", "PEFT", "SFTTrainer", "dataset preparation", "tokenization", "training arguments", "accelerator", "HuggingFace", "transformers"], "summary_hash": "ecf060c79a6a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:02:21+00:00"}
