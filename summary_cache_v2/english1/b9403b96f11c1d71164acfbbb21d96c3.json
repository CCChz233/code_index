{"summary": "The module defines a set of PyTorch building blocks for constructing a transformer model optimized for tensor‑parallel execution. It includes a configurable multi‑head attention layer, a three‑layer feed‑forward block, an RMS‑based normalization layer, a transformer block that combines attention and feed‑forward with residual connections, and a full transformer model that stacks these blocks, handles token embeddings, pre‑computes rotary positional frequencies, and provides a final projection.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to build scalable, high‑performance transformer architectures that can be distributed across multiple GPUs or devices, facilitating training and inference of large language models with efficient positional encoding.", "keywords": ["transformer", "multi‑head attention", "feed‑forward", "RMSNorm", "rotary embeddings", "tensor parallel", "PyTorch", "distributed training", "language model"], "summary_hash": "893d403eac04", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:11:53+00:00"}
