{"summary": "Provides the entry point for the airbrake system on a Raspberry Pi, constructing the operational context, initializing sensors, actuators, telemetry and logging components, and executing the continuous flight control loop. It supports real hardware, simulated devices, and mock environments, handling data processing, apogee prediction, and servo actuation.", "business_intent": "Enable automated deployment and testing of airbrake mechanisms for rockets or similar vehicles by delivering a configurable, end‑to‑end flight management application that can run on actual hardware or in simulated/mock setups for development and validation.", "keywords": ["airbrake", "Raspberry Pi", "flight control", "IMU", "servo", "telemetry", "apogee prediction", "simulation", "mock hardware", "logging", "camera", "command line"], "summary_hash": "163e2f93a0dd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:27:19+00:00"}
