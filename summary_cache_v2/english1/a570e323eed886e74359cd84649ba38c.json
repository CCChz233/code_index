{"summary": "Implements a text‑to‑image diffusion pipeline that augments Stable Diffusion with an attention‑based control mechanism. The pipeline encodes prompts with a CLIP text encoder, iteratively denoises latents using a UNet and scheduler, applies custom attention manipulation to guide generation, decodes the results with a VAE, and optionally runs a safety filter. Helper utilities support attention recording, Gaussian smoothing of tensors, and scaling of LoRA layers.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and creators to produce more controllable and expressive AI‑generated images for use cases such as advertising, design, entertainment, and research where precise guidance of diffusion models is required.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "attention manipulation", "text-to-image generation", "diffusion pipeline", "CLIP encoder", "UNet denoiser", "VAE decoder", "safety filter", "LoRA scaling", "Gaussian smoothing"], "summary_hash": "49dfa505bd00", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:43:04+00:00"}
