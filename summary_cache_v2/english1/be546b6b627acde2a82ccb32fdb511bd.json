{"summary": "The module implements a collection of custom loss components used to train a spectrogram‑enhancement GAN for text‑to‑speech. It provides regularisation that enforces similarity between original and enhanced spectrograms on a reduced mel scale, a generator objective, an R1 gradient‑penalty term for the discriminator, and a hinge‑type margin loss for binary decisions.", "business_intent": "Enable higher‑fidelity and more natural speech synthesis by supplying the necessary loss functions to train adversarial spectrogram enhancers, improving the quality and stability of TTS models.", "keywords": ["spectrogram", "loss", "consistency regularization", "generator loss", "gradient penalty", "R1", "hinge loss", "GAN", "text-to-speech", "neural speech synthesis", "mel-frequency", "regularization"], "summary_hash": "f2301d1a9dcb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:56:11+00:00"}
