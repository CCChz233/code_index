{"summary": "Implements a dual‑layer caching system that transparently writes to and reads from both an in‑memory cache and a Redis cache, ensuring low‑latency access while keeping a persistent distributed store synchronized. Includes a size‑limited ordered dictionary to manage cache capacity and supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑performance, fault‑tolerant caching mechanism for Litellm services, enabling rapid local lookups for frequent data while maintaining consistency across multiple processes or machines via Redis, thereby improving response times and scalability.", "keywords": ["dual cache", "in‑memory cache", "Redis cache", "synchronization", "low latency", "distributed cache", "asynchronous caching", "ordered dictionary", "capacity limit", "thread pool"], "summary_hash": "b2226b8cd5e0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:46:33+00:00"}
