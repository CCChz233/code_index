{"summary": "This module supplies dummy placeholder implementations for a large collection of diffusion and generative model pipelines. Each class inherits from a generic dummy object and is wrapped with backend requirement checks, so that the library can be imported even when heavy dependencies like PyTorch or Transformers are absent, while providing clear error messages if the placeholders are invoked.", "business_intent": "Facilitate optional dependency management by allowing the package to be installed and imported without requiring torch or transformers, preserving the public API surface and delivering informative runtime errors when unavailable functionality is accessed.", "keywords": ["dummy", "placeholder", "pipeline", "diffusion", "generative models", "optional dependencies", "torch", "transformers", "requires_backends", "fallback", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "eff9e8229278", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:10:46+00:00"}
