{"summary": "The module offers a comprehensive toolbox for handling rectangular bounding boxes in 2‑D and 3‑D. It defines a canonical coordinate ordering, multiple parameterizations (center‑size, corner‑corner, etc.), and provides utilities to convert between these formats, compute geometric properties (area, centers, IoU, GIoU), clip boxes to image bounds, and perform operations such as non‑max suppression.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable and consistent processing of detection bounding boxes across MONAI pipelines, ensuring that downstream models and algorithms can interchangeably work with different box representations while maintaining accurate spatial calculations.", "keywords": ["bounding box", "standard mode", "center-size representation", "corner representation", "conversion", "IoU", "GIoU", "non‑max suppression", "clipping", "spatial dimensions", "detection pipeline"], "summary_hash": "df7202dcbba3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:12:23+00:00"}
