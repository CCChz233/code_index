It constructs the model architecture, processes image patches, computes the reconstruction loss, provides access to input embeddings, and supports optional head pruning.", "business_intent": "Facilitate self‑supervised pre‑training of vision transformer models to learn rich visual features that can be fine‑tuned for downstream computer‑vision tasks.", "keywords": ["TensorFlow", "Vision Transformer", "Masked AutoEncoder", "pre‑training", "image patching", "reconstruction loss", "embeddings", "head pruning"], "summary_hash": "e19d094f342e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:43:58+00:00"}
