It uses prior UNet, text encoder, feature extractor, image encoder, tokenizer, scheduler. It encodes prompts (text and/or image) into embeddings, runs diffusion prior to produce image embedding, uses classifier-free guidance, etc. Business intent: Provide high-quality image generation prior for Stable Cascade models, enabling text-to-image generation pipelines.
