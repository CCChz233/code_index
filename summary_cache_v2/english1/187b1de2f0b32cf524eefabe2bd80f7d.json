{"summary": "Provides a probabilistic random erasing augmentation that selects a rectangular region within each image tensor, based on configurable area scale and aspect‑ratio ranges, and replaces the region with a specified fill value. Supports batch processing, optional uniform transformation across the batch, and configurable output dimensionality.", "business_intent": "Enhance model generalization and robustness in computer‑vision training pipelines by introducing stochastic occlusion as a regularization technique.", "keywords": ["random erasing", "image augmentation", "tensor", "probability", "rectangle", "scale", "aspect ratio", "batch processing", "fill value", "regularization", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "0f1e33556dee", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:53:30+00:00"}
