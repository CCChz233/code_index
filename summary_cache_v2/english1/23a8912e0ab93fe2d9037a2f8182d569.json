{"summary": "A Flax pipeline that performs text‑guided image‑to‑image generation using Stable Diffusion. It encodes an input image into latent space, conditions the diffusion process on a CLIP‑based text prompt, iteratively denoises the latents with a UNet and scheduler, decodes the result back to an image, and optionally runs a safety checker to filter harmful content.", "business_intent": "Provide developers and creators with a ready‑to‑use, high‑performance tool for generating customized images from existing pictures and textual descriptions, supporting creative content creation, design prototyping, marketing assets, and other applications that require controllable AI‑generated visuals while maintaining safety standards.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion", "image-to-image", "text-guided generation", "Flax", "diffusion pipeline", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "safety checker", "CLIP", "tokenizer", "latent space", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "46b9aff6b5c3", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:25:18+00:00"}
