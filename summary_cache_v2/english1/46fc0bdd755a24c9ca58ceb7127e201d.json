{"summary": "Implements the core attention operations used in Megatron‑based transformer models, offering configurable recomputation to save memory and multiple high‑performance kernels (flash, CUDA, Triton, and standard PyTorch) for the forward pass. It also defines parallel and chunked cross‑attention layers that can process sequences in a distributed fashion and integrates adapter configurations (e.g., LoRA) for parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning.", "business_intent": "Provide a fast, memory‑efficient, and extensible attention implementation that enables large‑scale language model training and inference on diverse hardware while supporting adapter‑based fine‑tuning strategies.", "keywords": ["attention", "transformer", "Megatron", "parallel", "flash attention", "memory recomputation", "cross‑attention", "chunked processing", "LoRA adapters", "CUDA", "Triton", "rotary embeddings", "XPOS"], "summary_hash": "4ed8415d8728", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:24:16+00:00"}
