{"summary": "This module provides a standalone training script that fine‑tunes the Stable Diffusion XL model for text‑to‑image generation using parameter‑efficient LoRA adapters. It handles argument parsing, dataset preparation, model loading, distributed training orchestration via Accelerate, loss computation, checkpointing, and optional model‑card creation for publishing on Hugging Face.", "business_intent": "Allow researchers and developers to quickly adapt a large diffusion model to custom visual concepts or domains with minimal compute overhead, facilitating the creation of tailored text‑to‑image generation services or products.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion XL", "text-to-image", "fine-tuning", "LoRA", "parameter-efficient adaptation", "accelerate", "distributed training", "dataset preprocessing", "model checkpoint", "Hugging Face Hub", "diffusion models"], "summary_hash": "8915a29ffd2a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:08:28+00:00"}
