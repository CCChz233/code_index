{"summary": "Implements a dataset loader that transforms the QM9 molecular collection into DGL graphs, where atoms become nodes with atomic numbers and 3‑D coordinates, and edges are added between atoms within a configurable distance. The loader attaches quantum‑chemical regression targets as labels and reports the number of prediction tasks.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and engineers to train graph neural network models for accurate prediction of molecular quantum properties, streamlining data preparation and feature engineering for regression tasks on the QM9 benchmark.", "keywords": ["QM9", "molecular graph dataset", "DGL", "graph neural networks", "regression targets", "atomic numbers", "3D coordinates", "distance cutoff", "property prediction", "machine learning"], "summary_hash": "c6d864811d19", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:39:44+00:00"}
