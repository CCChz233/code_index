{"summary": "Provides a Lightning-compatible logger that creates and manages a Comet.ml experiment, handling both online and offline configurations. It forwards initialization arguments to the Comet SDK, records hyperparameters, metrics, model graphs, and other assets, finalizes the run, and exposes the underlying experiment object for advanced logging capabilities.", "business_intent": "Facilitate comprehensive experiment tracking and monitoring in PyTorch Lightning workflows, enabling reproducibility, performance analysis, and model registry integration through Comet.ml.", "keywords": ["Comet.ml", "experiment tracking", "logging", "hyperparameters", "metrics", "model graph", "offline mode", "online mode", "PyTorch Lightning", "model registry", "asset logging", "code versioning"], "summary_hash": "c84710924d38", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:16:03+00:00"}
