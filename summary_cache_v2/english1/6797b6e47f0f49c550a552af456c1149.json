{"summary": "The module provides tools for assessing 3‑dimensional medical image segmentation results. It defines a class that compares predicted and reference masks, handling voxel spacing, optional small‑object removal, and overlap thresholds to categorize objects as true positives, false positives, or false negatives, and then calculates a comprehensive set of quantitative metrics such as volume differences, detection rates, and size‑specific performance measures.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and clinicians to quantitatively evaluate and benchmark segmentation algorithms on volumetric medical imaging data, facilitating model validation, performance reporting, and regulatory compliance.", "keywords": ["3D segmentation evaluation", "medical imaging", "true positive", "false positive", "false negative", "volume difference", "detection rate", "size-specific metrics", "voxel spacing", "post‑processing", "quantitative analysis"], "summary_hash": "ed576378108a", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:29:17+00:00"}
