{"summary": "A PyTorch module that decodes input features into hidden and output representations using a configurable stack of vertical layers, optionally integrating a message‑passing network for graph‑structured data. It accepts dimensions for input, hidden, and output features as well as the desired depth, and provides a forward pass that produces the decoded representation.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible, depth‑adjustable decoding within graph neural network pipelines, supporting tasks such as node classification, link prediction, or graph generation by enriching feature transformation through stacked layers and message‑passing operations.", "keywords": ["decoder", "stacked layers", "depth", "hidden representation", "graph neural network", "message passing", "PyTorch", "feature transformation"], "summary_hash": "108006addac4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:15:39+00:00"}
