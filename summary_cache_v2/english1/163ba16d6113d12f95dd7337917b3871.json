{"summary": "Provides a Megatron‑based model class that fine‑tunes a retrieval‑augmented language model (Retro) on downstream tasks such as question answering. It assembles and blends multiple datasets, configures specialized batch samplers, and integrates with MegatronT5 and retrieval components to enable efficient training within the NeMo framework.", "business_intent": "Allow organizations and researchers to adapt large pretrained Megatron‑Retro language models to specific applications, improving task performance and reducing the need to train from scratch.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "Retro", "fine‑tuning", "language modeling", "retrieval‑augmented generation", "question answering", "dataset blending", "batch sampling", "NLP", "PyTorch Lightning"], "summary_hash": "b5a0799fa8a1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:35:13+00:00"}
