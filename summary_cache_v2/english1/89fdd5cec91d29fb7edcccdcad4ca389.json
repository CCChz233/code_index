{"summary": "The module implements a load‑testing harness for the Litellm Router. It creates many concurrent completion requests (e.g., to OpenAI) using threads, measures response times, tracks successes and failures, and reports performance metrics for the router under simulated traffic.", "business_intent": "To benchmark and validate the scalability, latency, and reliability of the Litellm routing layer when handling high‑volume LLM inference calls.", "keywords": ["load testing", "Litellm Router", "concurrency", "benchmarking", "LLM completion", "performance measurement", "stress test"], "summary_hash": "2d075c827188", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:15:41+00:00"}
