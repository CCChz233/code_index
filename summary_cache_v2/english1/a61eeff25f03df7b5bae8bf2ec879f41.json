{"summary": "The module implements a TensorRT‑accelerated Stable Diffusion inpainting pipeline. It defines abstractions for model metadata, engine lifecycle, graph optimizations, and a high‑level pipeline that encodes images and masks, conditions on text prompts, runs denoising with a TensorRT‑optimized UNet, decodes the latent results, and applies safety checks.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑performance solution for AI‑driven image editing and content creation, enabling rapid generation of inpainted images using Stable Diffusion on NVIDIA GPUs.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "image inpainting", "TensorRT", "GPU acceleration", "ONNX", "model optimization", "UNet", "VAE", "CLIP", "diffusion pipeline", "safety checker", "content creation"], "summary_hash": "abd2897689bd", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:00:14+00:00"}
