{"summary": "Defines a LinearFunction class that represents a linear reversible quantum operation on a set of qubits using a binary matrix. It handles conversion between circuit, Clifford, and permutation forms and synthesizes the operation into an optimal sequence of CNOT and SWAP gates via the Patel‑Markov‑Hayes algorithm.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum developers to efficiently model, analyze, and compile linear reversible functions into minimal CNOT/SWAP gate networks, facilitating optimized quantum circuit construction and resource reduction.", "keywords": ["linear reversible", "quantum circuit", "binary matrix", "CNOT synthesis", "SWAP gates", "Clifford conversion", "permutation representation", "optimal algorithm", "Patel-Markov-Hayes", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "a79bf191c2dd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:14:39+00:00"}
