{"summary": "This module orchestrates the creation of node prediction pipelines by handling configuration loading, merging defaults, rendering training scripts from Jinja2 templates, and writing them to the filesystem. It integrates data and model factories, supports early‑stop and device options, and exposes descriptive metadata for the generated pipeline, providing a command‑line interface for easy execution.", "business_intent": "Automate the generation of reproducible, configurable node prediction training pipelines for graph neural network models, streamlining experimentation and deployment.", "keywords": ["node prediction", "pipeline generation", "script templating", "configuration management", "DGL", "early stopping", "device selection", "YAML processing", "factory pattern", "command-line interface"], "summary_hash": "d1521b2609c7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:01:25+00:00"}
