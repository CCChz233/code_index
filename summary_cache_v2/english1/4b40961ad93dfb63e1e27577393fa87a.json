{"summary": "The module defines mixin utilities that enhance NeMo objects with automatic model I/O handling and configuration capture. One mixin maintains a registry of connector classes keyed by file extensions, enabling dynamic import and export of models. The other intercepts object construction to store initialization arguments in a Fiddle configuration, allowing the object's state to be serialized and later reconstructed via a reinitialization helper.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless model serialization, deserialization, and reproducible reconstruction of NeMo components by providing extensible connector registration and automatic capture of construction parameters.", "keywords": ["mixin", "connector registry", "file extension mapping", "model import", "model export", "configuration capture", "Fiddle", "serialization", "reinitialization", "IOProtocol", "ModelConnector", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "063f324682be", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:50:04+00:00"}
