{"summary": "This module models the lifecycle of adult cancers in a population health simulation, covering incidence, disease progression, symptom emergence, diagnostic investigations, treatment initiation, post‑treatment follow‑up, palliative care for metastatic disease, and related mortality. It integrates with appointment scheduling, health service alerts, resource consumption, and produces disability‑adjusted life‑year (DALY) metrics.", "business_intent": "To enable policymakers and researchers to assess the health impact, resource needs, and cost‑effectiveness of interventions for adult cancers by providing a detailed, event‑driven simulation of cancer burden and care pathways.", "keywords": ["adult cancer", "disease simulation", "incidence", "progression", "diagnosis", "treatment", "palliative care", "follow‑up", "health service interaction", "resource utilization", "DALY", "population health modeling"], "summary_hash": "5a372b12a572", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:50:40+00:00"}
