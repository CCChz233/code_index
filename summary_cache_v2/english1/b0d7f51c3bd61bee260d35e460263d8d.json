{"summary": "This module implements the command‑line interface for the ivadomed package. It defines argument parsers, loads and validates configuration files, prepares datasets, and dispatches high‑level operations such as model training, inference, evaluation, and related utilities (e.g., logging, output handling, and dataset versioning). It serves as the entry point that coordinates the various ivadomed components for medical image deep learning workflows.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and clinicians to run reproducible medical imaging deep‑learning pipelines (segmentation, classification, detection) from the terminal with flexible configuration, simplifying model development, testing, and deployment in research or clinical settings.", "keywords": ["command line interface", "argument parsing", "configuration management", "dataset preparation", "training", "inference", "evaluation", "medical imaging", "deep learning", "segmentation", "model selection", "logging", "BIDS", "preprocessing", "postprocessing", "uncertainty estimation", "metrics", "balance samples", "contrast parameters", "loader parameters", "split dataset", "object detection", "film normalization"], "summary_hash": "da5b2eb15808", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:29:21+00:00"}
