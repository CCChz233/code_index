{"summary": "A set of utilities that generate concise, human‑readable summaries of PyTorch Lightning models. The core component records per‑layer information such as class type, trainable parameter count, and input/output tensor shapes during a forward pass, and assembles this into a formatted table. An additional helper adapts the same concept for DeepSpeed‑accelerated models, aggregating shard‑level statistics and presenting average parameters per shard alongside total and trainable counts.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to quickly assess model complexity, memory footprint, and layer‑wise characteristics for debugging, performance tuning, and documentation, including support for distributed DeepSpeed training.", "keywords": ["model summary", "PyTorch Lightning", "layer statistics", "parameter count", "input shape", "output shape", "training mode", "evaluation mode", "model size", "DeepSpeed integration", "shard statistics"], "summary_hash": "af5ace1c8771", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:14:20+00:00"}
