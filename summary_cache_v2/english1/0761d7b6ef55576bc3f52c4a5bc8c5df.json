{"summary": "This test suite validates the caching layer of the Litellm library across various backends (Redis, S3, semantic stores) and use‑cases (text completions, embeddings, streaming, async batches). It checks default behavior, custom cache keys, TTL handling, cache control overrides, and integration with different model providers, ensuring that cached responses are correctly stored, retrieved, and respect configuration options.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that LLM request caching works reliably to reduce latency, lower API costs, and provide consistent results for downstream applications.", "keywords": ["caching", "redis", "s3", "ttl", "llm", "litellm", "embeddings", "completion", "streaming", "semantic cache", "async", "testing", "mock"], "summary_hash": "b35ef445e711", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:28:49+00:00"}
