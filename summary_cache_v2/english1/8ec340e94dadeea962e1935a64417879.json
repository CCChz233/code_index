{"summary": "Defines core autoencoder components for latent diffusion models, including a KL‑regularized encoder/decoder, a vector‑quantized variant, an identity stage, and an inference wrapper. These classes manage encoding to latent spaces, reconstruction, training loops, optimizer setup, checkpoint handling, and image logging within the NeMo framework.", "business_intent": "Support development and deployment of text‑to‑image generation pipelines by providing flexible, trainable autoencoder backbones for stable diffusion models, enabling both research experimentation and production inference.", "keywords": ["autoencoder", "latent diffusion", "stable diffusion", "KL regularization", "vector quantization", "encoder", "decoder", "training", "inference", "checkpoint", "logging", "NeMo", "PyTorch Lightning"], "summary_hash": "4484c35af14c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:07:27+00:00"}
