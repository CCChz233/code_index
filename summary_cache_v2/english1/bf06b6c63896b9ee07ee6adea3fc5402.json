{"summary": "A decoder that transforms CTC log‑probability tensors from subword‑based speech models into readable hypotheses. It supports both greedy and beam‑search strategies, optional timestamp extraction at character or word level, preservation of alignment and confidence information, and configurable batch dimensions, all driven by a flexible configuration object and a tokenizer.", "business_intent": "Enable robust speech‑to‑text pipelines that can produce transcriptions with timing and confidence metadata, suitable for applications such as real‑time captioning, voice assistants, and analytics where accuracy, latency, and interpretability are critical.", "keywords": ["CTC decoding", "greedy search", "beam search", "language model integration", "timestamp generation", "confidence scoring", "alignment preservation", "subword tokenization", "batch processing", "speech recognition"], "summary_hash": "9b9114dd5a2b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:30:50+00:00"}
