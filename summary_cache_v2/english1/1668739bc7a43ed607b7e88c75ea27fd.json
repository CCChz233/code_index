{"summary": "The module contains comprehensive unit tests for MONAI's DiffusionModelUNet, covering both 2‑D and 3‑D configurations. It verifies correct model setup, dimensionality handling, attention mechanisms, conditioning options, dropout settings, and proper error responses for invalid configurations, ensuring that the UNet behaves as expected within the diffusion generative framework.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness and robustness of diffusion model UNet implementations used in medical imaging generative pipelines, reducing risk of runtime failures and guaranteeing reliable performance before integration into production systems.", "keywords": ["diffusion model", "UNet", "2D", "3D", "unit testing", "MONAI", "attention", "conditioning", "dropout", "tensor shape validation", "error handling", "generative framework"], "summary_hash": "4a74885efbb1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:45:59+00:00"}
