{"summary": "This module implements the integration layer for the Ollama language‑model service, providing configuration handling, request construction, and response parsing for completions, embeddings, and streaming interactions. It abstracts Ollama's API behind a unified interface compatible with OpenAI‑style parameters, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous usage, and includes custom error handling.", "business_intent": "Allow applications to leverage Ollama's AI models through a standardized, OpenAI‑compatible SDK, simplifying the development of chat, completion, and embedding features while handling configuration, authentication, and error management.", "keywords": ["ollama", "language model", "API integration", "completion", "embeddings", "streaming", "asynchronous", "configuration", "error handling", "OpenAI compatibility", "http client"], "summary_hash": "4ddefc70e414", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:43:43+00:00"}
