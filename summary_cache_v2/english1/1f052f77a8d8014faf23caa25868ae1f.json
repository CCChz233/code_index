{"summary": "A transformer‑based diffusion model for 2‑D latent image generation that can be plugged into the Stable Diffusion pipeline. It exposes a highly configurable architecture—sample size, patch granularity, channel count, hidden dimension, depth, attention heads, key/value heads, feed‑forward scaling, normalization settings, and optional sigma learning—while supporting cross‑attention to text embeddings for conditional generation.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to generate high‑fidelity images from text or latent inputs using a scalable, modular diffusion backbone, facilitating AI‑driven art, design, and visual content production.", "keywords": ["diffusion model", "transformer backbone", "latent image generation", "text‑conditioned generation", "stable diffusion integration", "configurable architecture", "attention mechanisms", "AI art", "content creation"], "summary_hash": "e138c050fab2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:37:27+00:00"}
