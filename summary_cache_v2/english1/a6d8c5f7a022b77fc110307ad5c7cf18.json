{"summary": "The module implements a collection of learning‑rate scheduler classes and helper utilities that generate various annealing curves (cosine, polynomial, inverse‑square‑root, Noam, square‑root, etc.) with optional warm‑up, hold, and decay phases, and provides registration and retrieval mechanisms for integrating these schedules with PyTorch optimizers.", "business_intent": "To supply flexible and configurable learning‑rate scheduling strategies that improve model training convergence and performance across different deep‑learning architectures.", "keywords": ["learning rate scheduler", "annealing", "warmup", "hold phase", "decay", "cosine decay", "polynomial decay", "inverse square root", "Noam schedule", "PyTorch", "optimizer", "deep learning training"], "summary_hash": "13935fcc587d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:41:53+00:00"}
