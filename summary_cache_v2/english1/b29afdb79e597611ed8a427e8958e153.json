{"summary": "A rule‑based state machine that automatically builds random quantum circuits with configurable numbers of qubits, adds quantum and classical registers, inserts randomly selected gates and parameters, periodically transpiles the circuit for a randomly chosen backend and optimization level, simulates both the original and transpiled circuits, and verifies that their measurement counts are identical.", "business_intent": "Enable automated fuzz testing and validation of quantum compilation pipelines, allowing developers to generate diverse circuit workloads, ensure transpilation correctness, and benchmark simulation and backend performance.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit generation", "randomized testing", "Qiskit transpilation", "state‑machine fuzzing", "simulation verification", "backend selection", "optimization level", "measurement equivalence", "quantum computing", "software validation"], "summary_hash": "ced03294afbc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:34:40+00:00"}
