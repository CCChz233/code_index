{"summary": "The script showcases how to perform text‑to‑image inference with the Stable Diffusion XL model using NeMo's Megatron diffusion engine. It sets up the model configuration, initializes the sampling pipeline, runs generation for given prompts, and saves the resulting images locally.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example that enables developers and researchers to generate images from textual prompts with a state‑of‑the‑art diffusion model, facilitating integration, testing, and evaluation of text‑to‑image capabilities in their applications.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "text-to-image", "inference", "diffusion engine", "sampling pipeline", "model configuration", "image generation", "Megatron", "Hydra", "PyTorch", "save images"], "summary_hash": "010aa401fba9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:37:50+00:00"}
