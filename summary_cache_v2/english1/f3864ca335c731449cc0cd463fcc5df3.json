{"summary": "This module implements abstractions and helper utilities for performing reduction operations on tensors within CUDA kernels, leveraging Numba. It defines generic operation interfaces and specific reduction configurations, and provides optimized functions for common reductions such as sum, max, and exponentiation, which are used in the RNNT loss computation pipeline.", "business_intent": "To accelerate RNNT loss calculations in speech recognition models by providing high‑performance CUDA‑based reduction utilities that efficiently aggregate tensor data on the GPU.", "keywords": ["CUDA", "Numba", "reduction", "tensor", "GPU", "RNNT loss", "ASR", "neural network", "performance", "aggregation"], "summary_hash": "7ff4260cbe87", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:17:15+00:00"}
