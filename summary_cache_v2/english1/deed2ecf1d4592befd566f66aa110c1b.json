{"summary": "Implements a metric that measures the proportion of correct predictions for integer‑encoded class labels. It compares the index of the highest predicted score with the true label, accumulates weighted counts, and returns the ratio as the sparse categorical accuracy.", "business_intent": "Provides a ready‑to‑use evaluation metric for Keras models that perform multi‑class classification with sparse labels, enabling users to track model performance during training and validation, and to integrate it via the compile API.", "keywords": ["sparse categorical accuracy", "metric", "Keras", "classification", "integer labels", "sample weight", "prediction argmax", "model evaluation", "accuracy calculation"], "summary_hash": "ef0314510d5e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:46:55+00:00"}
