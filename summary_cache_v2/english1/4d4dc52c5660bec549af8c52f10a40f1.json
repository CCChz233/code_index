{"summary": "The module serves as a low‑level bridge between Python and DGL's compiled library. It loads the shared library via ctypes, defines a custom exception for DGL errors, and offers helper utilities to convert Python data (arrays, strings) into C‑compatible formats, wrap library calls with error checking, and optionally enable a tensor adaptor interface.", "business_intent": "Enable the Python DGL API to interact reliably with the underlying C++ implementation by handling library loading, type conversion, and error propagation, thereby supporting high‑performance graph computations.", "keywords": ["ctypes", "shared library loading", "error handling", "C array conversion", "string conversion", "decorator utilities", "tensor adaptor", "DGL", "low‑level bindings"], "summary_hash": "c1dcfc87f798", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:36:34+00:00"}
