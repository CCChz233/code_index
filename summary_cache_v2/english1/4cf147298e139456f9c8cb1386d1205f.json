{"summary": "Utility module that wraps and extends PyTorch's internal pytree functionality, providing helpers to identify leaf or primitive containers, flatten nested structures, and map values back onto a tree shape. These functions enable Lightning to manipulate complex nested data (e.g., model parameters, state dicts) in a consistent, tree‑aware manner.", "business_intent": "Facilitate robust handling of nested data structures within Lightning's PyTorch integration, ensuring seamless flattening, mapping, and reconstruction of model‑related tensors and containers for training, checkpointing, and distributed operations.", "keywords": ["pytree", "flatten", "unflatten", "leaf detection", "tree mapping", "torch", "Lightning", "utility", "nested structures", "state dict"], "summary_hash": "e20131aa9c15", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:54:31+00:00"}
