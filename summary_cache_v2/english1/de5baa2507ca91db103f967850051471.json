{"summary": "Provides a token‑level classification model that restores missing punctuation and capitalization in raw text, such as automatic speech recognition output. It leverages a pretrained BERT‑style encoder with separate MLP heads for punctuation and capitalization tags, and includes data handling, loss aggregation, metric reporting, and full training/validation/testing/inference pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enhance the readability and downstream processing of transcribed or unformatted text by automatically adding correct punctuation and capitalization, thereby improving user experience and the performance of subsequent NLP applications.", "keywords": ["token classification", "punctuation restoration", "capitalization", "BERT", "ASR post‑processing", "multilayer perceptron heads", "training pipeline", "evaluation metrics", "inference"], "summary_hash": "2c58c5424b61", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:36:43+00:00"}
