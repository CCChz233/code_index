{"summary": "A configuration container that holds all architectural and training hyperparameters for a Camembert transformer model, such as vocabulary size, hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, dropout rates, position embedding type, and decoder settings. It inherits from a generic pretrained configuration class and is used to instantiate encoder or decoder variants of Camembert models.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to customize and reproduce Camembert model architectures for French language processing tasks, facilitating model creation, fine‑tuning, and deployment with specific hyperparameter settings.", "keywords": ["Camembert", "Transformer", "configuration", "hyperparameters", "vocab size", "hidden size", "attention heads", "dropout", "position embeddings", "decoder", "classifier"], "summary_hash": "386acb1bea22", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:04:37+00:00"}
