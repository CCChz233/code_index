It checks that nested data structures can be correctly flattened into a list of leaves and reconstructed, including handling of different nesting depths.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability of Lightning's pytree utilities for serializing and deserializing complex nested structures, which is essential for model checkpointing, data handling, and distributed training workflows.", "keywords": ["pytree", "flatten", "unflatten", "nested structures", "unit test", "torch", "Lightning", "depth handling", "data serialization"], "summary_hash": "87c18bce8f22", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:34:36+00:00"}
