{"summary": "The module offers utilities for converting Qiskit QuantumCircuit objects to and from OpenQASM 3 code. It provides high‑level functions for dumping circuits to files or strings, loading programs from files or strings, and a configurable exporter class. Experimental flags allow use of upcoming language features, while an optional native Rust parser supplies a faster, more diagnostic import path with support for custom gate constructors and include files.", "business_intent": "Facilitate interoperability between Qiskit and the OpenQASM 3 language, enabling users to serialize quantum programs for storage, sharing, and execution on compatible back‑ends, and to reconstruct circuits from OpenQASM 3 sources, while supporting evolving language features and performance‑optimized parsing.", "keywords": ["OpenQASM 3", "Qiskit", "QuantumCircuit", "serialization", "deserialization", "export", "import", "experimental features", "native parser", "custom gates", "include files", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "bc442708dd84", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:56:52+00:00"}
