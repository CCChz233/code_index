{"summary": "The module presents several matrix examples that illustrate various approaches to storing and accessing numeric data, from a simple mutable grid to high‑performance containers that use Cython's buffer protocol and C++ vectors, while handling dynamic row addition and view‑count management for safe memory usage.", "business_intent": "Teach developers how to build efficient numeric containers with Cython by leveraging contiguous buffers, fast element access, and proper memory‑view handling, serving as a practical guide in the user documentation.", "keywords": ["matrix", "Cython buffer protocol", "contiguous memory", "dynamic rows", "view count", "numeric grid", "performance", "example", "user guide", "C++ vectors"], "summary_hash": "a7a1fe178eed", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:31:29+00:00"}
