{"summary": "The script serves as an example that demonstrates how to fine‑tune causal language models (e.g., GPT, GPT‑2, CTRL) on a text dataset using the Accelerate library together with DeepSpeed, without relying on the HuggingFace Trainer. It handles argument parsing, dataset loading, tokenization, text grouping, model configuration, training loop, evaluation, and checkpoint management.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with a ready‑to‑run reference implementation for efficiently adapting large language models to custom text data using DeepSpeed’s performance optimizations, facilitating rapid experimentation and integration into production pipelines.", "keywords": ["fine‑tuning", "causal language modeling", "GPT", "DeepSpeed", "Accelerate", "Transformers", "tokenization", "dataset", "configuration", "training loop", "evaluation", "example script"], "summary_hash": "9d299f48b414", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:17:07+00:00"}
