{"summary": "The module provides a runnable example that fine‑tunes a pre‑trained transformer model for sequence classification on a text dataset. It handles dataset loading, tokenization, creation of PyTorch dataloaders with a custom collate function, and executes a training and evaluation loop using the Accelerate library for efficient multi‑GPU or distributed execution.", "business_intent": "Showcase a practical workflow for building and scaling a text classification model, enabling developers and data scientists to quickly adopt transformer‑based NLP solutions in production or research environments.", "keywords": ["NLP", "text classification", "transformer", "fine‑tuning", "HuggingFace", "datasets", "Accelerate", "PyTorch", "tokenization", "dataloader", "distributed training"], "summary_hash": "7263f8a1af23", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:15:10+00:00"}
