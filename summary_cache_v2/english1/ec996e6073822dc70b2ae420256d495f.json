It encapsulates the decoded output for easy access and downstream processing.", "business_intent": "Standardize the representation of decoder results so that downstream components such as evaluation, visualization, or further transformations can reliably consume the generated data.", "keywords": ["decoder", "output", "tensor", "batch", "channels", "height", "width", "model inference", "generated sample"], "summary_hash": "cf24f257859b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:35:56+00:00"}
