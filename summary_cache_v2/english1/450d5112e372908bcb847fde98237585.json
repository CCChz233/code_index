{"summary": "A configurable dataset class that reads a manifest describing input audio files, corresponding target audio files, and associated embedding vectors. It loads the audio at a specified sample rate, optionally extracts synchronized random subsegments, applies duration-based filtering, channel selection, and optional global normalization, returning a tuple of input, target, and embedding for each sample.", "business_intent": "Enable machine‑learning pipelines for audio transformation tasks—such as voice conversion, speech enhancement, or style transfer—by supplying paired source and target audio together with auxiliary embedding information, streamlining data preparation for supervised training.", "keywords": ["audio dataset", "paired audio", "embedding vector", "manifest file", "sample rate", "subsegment cropping", "random offset", "duration filtering", "channel selection", "normalization", "speech processing", "machine learning", "audio-to-audio transformation"], "summary_hash": "a95017e393b4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:15:33+00:00"}
