{"summary": "The module implements differentiable image similarity losses for deep learning, offering a global mutual information based loss that uses Parzen window density estimation with selectable kernel functions, and a local normalized cross‑correlation loss. It also includes helper utilities to generate common kernels (Gaussian, rectangular, triangular) used in these calculations.", "business_intent": "Provide flexible, back‑propagatable similarity metrics to improve training of medical imaging models such as registration and segmentation, enabling more accurate alignment and better overall model performance.", "keywords": ["image similarity", "mutual information", "normalized cross correlation", "loss function", "kernel density estimation", "Gaussian kernel", "Parzen window", "medical imaging", "deep learning", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "704a25de9aa8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:15:13+00:00"}
