{"summary": "A diffusion scheduler that implements a cosine‑based noise schedule combined with the DPMSolver multistep integration method. It supports configurable sigma ranges, solver order, solver type, and prediction modes, allowing fine‑grained control over the sampling trajectory for diffusion models, particularly in audio generation contexts.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, stable, and high‑fidelity audio synthesis by providing an optimized sampling routine that reduces inference steps while preserving quality, facilitating deployment of diffusion‑based audio models in production environments.", "keywords": ["diffusion scheduler", "cosine schedule", "DPMSolver", "multistep solver", "audio generation", "noise sigma schedule", "inference efficiency", "stable diffusion", "sampling stability", "model prediction types"], "summary_hash": "3cbb6fe18fcb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:56:46+00:00"}
