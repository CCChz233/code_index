{"summary": "The module implements a suite of utility functions that mirror common NumPy operations (e.g., allclose, argwhere, concatenate, cumsum, etc.) but accept either NumPy arrays or PyTorch tensors. Each function detects the input type, performs the appropriate library call, and handles any necessary type or device conversion, providing a unified interface for array manipulation across the two frameworks.", "business_intent": "Enable MONAI transforms and other medical imaging code to operate seamlessly on both NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors without duplicating logic, thereby simplifying development, improving maintainability, and ensuring consistent behavior across different data representations.", "keywords": ["numpy", "pytorch", "compatibility", "utility functions", "array operations", "type conversion", "medical imaging", "transforms", "unified API"], "summary_hash": "d505f6c50869", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:04:34+00:00"}
