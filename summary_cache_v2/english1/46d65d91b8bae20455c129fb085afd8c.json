{"summary": "The module implements a command‑line pipeline that ingests raw documents (e.g., PDFs), splits them into semantic chunks, creates embeddings, and uses large language models to generate instructional prompts, questions, and answers. It orchestrates parallel processing, checkpointing, and progress tracking to build or augment datasets suitable for fine‑tuning or evaluation of conversational AI systems.", "business_intent": "Automate the creation of high‑quality instruction‑following datasets from unstructured source material, enabling organizations to efficiently produce training data for AI assistants and other LLM‑based products.", "keywords": ["dataset generation", "document chunking", "semantic splitting", "LLM prompting", "question‑answer generation", "instruction synthesis", "OpenAI API", "LangChain embeddings", "checkpointing", "parallel processing", "PDF parsing", "command‑line interface"], "summary_hash": "a50f46533d06", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:37:47+00:00"}
