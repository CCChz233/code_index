{"summary": "The module defines utilities for preparing speech‑to‑text data using Lhotse. It offers a PyTorch‑compatible dataset that converts Lhotse CutSet metadata into batched audio features and BPE‑tokenized transcripts, handling tokenization, optional augmentation, and feature extraction while relying on Lhotse samplers for sampling and de‑duplication. It also provides a wrapper that unifies different tokenization back‑ends (NeMo tokenizer, aggregate tokenizer, character parser) under a common interface.", "business_intent": "Facilitate efficient training and evaluation of automatic speech recognition models by streamlining the ingestion, preprocessing, and tokenization of large‑scale audio‑text corpora managed with Lhotse.", "keywords": ["Lhotse", "ASR", "speech-to-text", "dataset", "tokenization", "BPE", "PyTorch", "audio features", "collate", "neural types", "data augmentation"], "summary_hash": "d16efe00c26e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:08:32+00:00"}
