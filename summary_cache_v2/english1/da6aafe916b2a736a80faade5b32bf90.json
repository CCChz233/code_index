{"summary": "Provides a comprehensive implementation of the General‑Head Boundary (GHB) package for MODFLOW‑6 models. The module validates input arrays, manages hydraulic head and conductance data, supports optional solute concentration, handles repeat‑stress patterns, allocates GHB cells, distributes conductance, and integrates with transport packages. It also includes utilities for regridding and data preparation to ensure seamless incorporation of GHB boundaries into groundwater simulations.", "business_intent": "Enable engineers and scientists to efficiently define and incorporate General‑Head Boundary conditions in MODFLOW‑6 groundwater models, supporting both flow and transport simulations while ensuring data integrity and compatibility with model preprocessing workflows.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW-6", "General Head Boundary", "groundwater modeling", "hydraulic conductance", "boundary condition", "solute transport", "repeat stress", "allocation", "regridding", "data validation", "Python"], "summary_hash": "37d368940960", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:49:28+00:00"}
