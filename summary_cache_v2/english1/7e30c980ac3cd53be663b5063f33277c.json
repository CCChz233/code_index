{"summary": "This module implements Einstein summation (einsum) for CuPy arrays, handling subscript parsing, output shape inference, and contraction path optimization (greedy and optimal). It includes utilities for dimension manipulation, optional acceleration via cuTensor, and a reduced binary einsum variant.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑performance tensor operations on GPUs, supporting scientific and machine‑learning workloads that require flexible and efficient multi‑dimensional array contractions.", "keywords": ["einsum", "tensor contraction", "GPU", "CuPy", "cuTensor", "optimal path", "linear algebra", "high performance computing"], "summary_hash": "0309b7a918cd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:20:12+00:00"}
