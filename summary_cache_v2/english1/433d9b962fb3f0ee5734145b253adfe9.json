{"summary": "Defines a transformation pass that tracks successive DAG circuit states during transpilation to detect when a relative semi‑stable or local minimum has been reached. It records relevant property‑set values, keeps a deep copy of the best DAG observed, and after a configurable backtrack depth either signals that a fixed point is achieved or restores the stored minimum, serving as a loop‑break condition for iterative optimization passes.", "business_intent": "Enable transpilation pipelines to terminate early when further circuit optimizations no longer yield significant improvements, thereby reducing runtime and resource consumption in quantum circuit compilation.", "keywords": ["transpiler", "pass", "DAG circuit", "semi-stable point", "local minimum", "backtrack depth", "fixed point detection", "optimization loop", "quantum circuit", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "670ed4527ecb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:26:50+00:00"}
