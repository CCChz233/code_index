{"summary": "Implements an asymmetric variational autoencoder with KL regularization designed for Stable Diffusion, converting input images into a compact latent representation and reconstructing images from latents. The architecture is configurable via down‑sampling and up‑sampling block types, channel dimensions, and includes a scaling factor to normalize the latent space variance.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable component for generating and reconstructing latent codes in diffusion‑based image synthesis pipelines, improving efficiency and quality of image generation for commercial AI services.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "KL regularization", "latent representation", "image reconstruction", "asymmetric architecture", "stable diffusion", "latent scaling", "configurable blocks", "deep learning model", "image synthesis"], "summary_hash": "c6071b799a49", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:29:24+00:00"}
