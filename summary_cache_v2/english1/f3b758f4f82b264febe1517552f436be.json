{"summary": "This module supplies a scheduler tailored for consistency decoder diffusion models. It encapsulates the logic for initializing noise parameters, scaling model inputs, configuring timesteps, and iteratively updating the latent sample during inference. An accompanying lightweight output container holds the sample from the previous diffusion step. A helper routine for generating a beta schedule is also present, though currently unused.", "business_intent": "Enable stable and efficient generation in diffusion pipelines by providing a configurable consistency decoder scheduler that manages noise schedules, input scaling, and timestep progression, thereby improving inference quality and performance for generative AI applications.", "keywords": ["consistency decoder", "scheduler", "diffusion model", "noise schedule", "timestep management", "inference", "torch", "dataclass", "output container", "beta schedule"], "summary_hash": "20bbe83e60c7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:14:11+00:00"}
