{"summary": "The module provides a suite of unit tests that verify the behavior of a utility for determining whether various Python type annotations are considered simple. It checks handling of primitive types, enums, literals, unions, and confirms that complex constructs like iterables and partials are not treated as simple.", "business_intent": "Validate the correctness of the simple‑type detection logic to guarantee reliable type handling in downstream components that rely on this classification.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "type inspection", "simple type detection", "enums", "literals", "unions", "iterables", "partial", "pydantic", "instructor.dsl"], "summary_hash": "21f46b26e4b2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:34:06+00:00"}
