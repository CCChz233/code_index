{"summary": "The module implements a basic gradient descent framework, offering helpers to compute hypothesis values, error metrics, cost derivatives, and an execution routine to iteratively update parameters using a fixed learning rate. It also includes profiling hooks and placeholder output and test functions.", "business_intent": "To provide a simple, educational implementation of gradient descent for optimizing a model (e.g., linear regression) and to illustrate performance tracing.", "keywords": ["gradient descent", "optimization", "learning rate", "hypothesis calculation", "cost derivative", "error metric", "numpy", "profiling", "viztracer", "machine learning"], "summary_hash": "7d54dbabce42", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:34:14+00:00"}
