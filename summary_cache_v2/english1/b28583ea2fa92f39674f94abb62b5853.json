{"summary": "Provides the core functionality for building and configuring a DiNTS neural network topology from binary architecture codes, handling channel scaling, cell operations, block depth, resolution levels, optional downsampling, and device placement. It translates path activation matrices into node connections and operation types, serving as the foundation for both searchable and instantiated network variants.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible creation and manipulation of neural network architectures within the DiNTS search space, supporting both architecture search and deployment by abstracting topology construction details.", "keywords": ["architecture code", "topology construction", "DiNTS", "neural network search space", "channel multiplier", "downsampling", "resolution scaling", "device placement", "path activation", "node mapping"], "summary_hash": "080fa09ce26a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:42:57+00:00"}
