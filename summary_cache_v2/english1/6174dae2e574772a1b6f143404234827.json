{"summary": "Implements a synthetic graph classification dataset where each graph consists of a Barabási–Albert base graph with either a house‑shaped or a five‑node cycle motif attached, resulting in two distinct classes. The class handles downloading, caching, processing, and provides indexed access to DGLGraph objects and their labels, along with metadata such as the number of classes.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and developers with a ready‑to‑use benchmark for training and evaluating graph neural networks and explainability techniques on controlled motif‑based classification problems.", "keywords": ["graph classification", "synthetic dataset", "Barabási–Albert", "motif", "house motif", "cycle motif", "GNN", "DGL", "dataset loading", "benchmark"], "summary_hash": "a1972b9dc06a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:44:51+00:00"}
