{"summary": "A command‑line training utility that fine‑tunes Stable Diffusion XL using low‑rank (LoRA) adapters and an ORPO reinforcement learning objective. It loads image‑text datasets, prepares prompts, configures the diffusion model and scheduler, runs the training loop with gradient accumulation, performs periodic validation image generation, logs metrics to WandB, and saves checkpoints to local storage or the Hugging Face hub.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and developers with an out‑of‑the‑box solution to adapt large text‑to‑image diffusion models to specific domains or styles while minimizing compute and memory costs, enabling rapid creation of customized generative AI products.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion XL", "LoRA", "ORPO", "diffusion model fine‑tuning", "text‑to‑image generation", "accelerate", "wandb logging", "checkpointing", "dataset preprocessing", "Hugging Face"], "summary_hash": "26080e707365", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:07:22+00:00"}
