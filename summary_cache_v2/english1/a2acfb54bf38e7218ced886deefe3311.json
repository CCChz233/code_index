{"summary": "Provides a utility to attach a pre‑computed gradient to a tensor, allowing custom gradient values to be used during the backward pass. Includes simple forward and backward helpers that integrate the injected gradient with the autograd system.", "business_intent": "Enable advanced training workflows where gradients are generated or modified outside the standard autograd pipeline, such as gradient preprocessing, manual optimization steps, or research experiments requiring custom gradient injection.", "keywords": ["gradient injection", "custom gradient", "tensor", "autograd", "forward helper", "backward helper", "loss.backward", "deep learning", "gradient manipulation"], "summary_hash": "87665a9fc0c8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:25:49+00:00"}
