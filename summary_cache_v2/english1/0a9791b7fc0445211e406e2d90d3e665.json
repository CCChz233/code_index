It scans directories, checks each file against a whitelist, and asserts that no disallowed async HTTP handler calls are present, thereby ensuring compliance with the project's async client usage policy.", "business_intent": "Enforce coding standards by preventing unauthorized asynchronous HTTP client usage, supporting code coverage compliance and maintaining consistent client implementation across the codebase.", "keywords": ["async", "HTTP handler", "AST parsing", "code coverage", "test", "directory scanning", "compliance", "whitelist"], "summary_hash": "a8935a11813d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T07:18:33+00:00"}
