{"summary": "This module implements a fused bias addition and Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GeLU) activation optimized for Megatron transformer models. It defines a custom autograd function to compute the GeLU activation and its gradient efficiently, and provides helper routines for the forward and backward passes of the fused operation.", "business_intent": "Accelerate training and inference of large-scale transformer models by reducing the computational and memory overhead associated with separate bias addition and activation steps, thereby improving overall performance and scalability.", "keywords": ["fused bias", "GeLU activation", "custom autograd", "PyTorch", "Megatron", "transformer optimization", "performance", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "e615d7a05f23", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:23:06+00:00"}
