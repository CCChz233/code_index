{"summary": "The package contains two example scripts that train a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on the CelebA face dataset. One script uses plain PyTorch for a simple, single‑node training loop, while the other leverages Lightning Fabric to accelerate the same workflow, supporting optional distributed execution, automatic checkpointing, and periodic sample generation.", "business_intent": "Showcase how to build and scale GAN training pipelines, illustrate the benefits of Lightning Fabric for faster and distributed deep‑learning workloads, and provide a ready‑to‑run reference for image synthesis applications.", "keywords": ["DCGAN", "GAN", "generative adversarial network", "PyTorch", "Lightning Fabric", "distributed training", "CelebA", "image synthesis", "deep learning", "model checkpointing"], "summary_hash": "64fe1e286e21", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:12:20+00:00"}
