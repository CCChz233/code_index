{"summary": "The file defines a suite of bias adjustment classes for climate data, each implementing a specific statistical correction method (e.g., detrended quantile mapping, empirical quantile mapping, LOCI, quantile delta mapping, scaling). These classes inherit from a common base that handles dataset creation, training, and adjustment workflows, while the subclasses implement the core learning and correction logic. The module also includes a utility function for raising errors on unsupported chunking configurations.", "business_intent": "To provide a comprehensive set of statistical bias correction tools for climate model outputs, enabling more accurate and reliable climate impact analyses and decision‑making.", "keywords": ["bias correction", "climate data", "quantile mapping", "LOCI", "scaling", "statistical adjustment", "trend preservation"], "summary_hash": "cf8a60484c56", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:32:01+00:00"}
