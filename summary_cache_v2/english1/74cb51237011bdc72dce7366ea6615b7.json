{"summary": "Implements the Quantum Shannon Decomposition algorithm to convert an arbitrary unitary matrix into a quantum circuit composed of elementary gates. The module provides recursive utilities for multiplexed rotations, controlled‑U constructions, and integrates one‑ and two‑qubit decomposers to break down the target unitary into CX, UCRY, UCRZ, and related gate primitives, ultimately yielding a Qiskit QuantumCircuit representation.", "business_intent": "Provide an automated, efficient method for compiling high‑level unitary operators into hardware‑compatible gate sequences, supporting quantum algorithm design, simulation, and execution on quantum devices within the Qiskit ecosystem.", "keywords": ["Quantum Shannon Decomposition", "unitary synthesis", "quantum circuit compilation", "multiplexed rotations", "controlled-U gates", "two‑qubit decomposition", "Qiskit", "gate decomposition", "quantum algorithm implementation", "hardware‑compatible gates"], "summary_hash": "70d5cfd8a6bf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:58:44+00:00"}
