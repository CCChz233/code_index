{"summary": "The module contains unit tests for MONAI's caching dataset classes, verifying that data is properly cached, dimensions are reported accurately, and that cached and persistent dataset loaders produce identical outputs across different configurations, epochs, and thread‑unsafe transform scenarios. It also defines a stateful transform used within the tests.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and efficiency of data caching mechanisms in medical imaging deep learning pipelines by validating correct behavior, thread safety, and consistency of MONAI's CacheDataset, PersistentDataset, and SmartCacheDataset implementations.", "keywords": ["CacheDataset", "PersistentDataset", "SmartCacheDataset", "data caching", "unit testing", "thread safety", "hash key handling", "medical imaging", "deep learning", "MONAI", "data loader", "transform", "stateful transform"], "summary_hash": "e858c674059d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:31:58+00:00"}
