{"summary": "A test suite that verifies the backward‑compatible behavior of the HighLevelSynthesis pass (formerly UnrollCustomDefinitions) by checking that custom quantum gate definitions are correctly expanded into primitive operations across a range of scenarios, including basic unrolling, qubit‑count constraints, parameterized gates with and without expressions, conditional chains, composite gates, and multi‑qubit primitives such as Toffoli.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the new high‑level synthesis transformation produces the same functional results as the legacy unroll pass, thereby maintaining reliability of the quantum compilation pipeline for existing code bases.", "keywords": ["unroll", "high‑level synthesis", "compatibility", "quantum circuit", "parameterized gates", "conditional", "toffoli", "transpiler", "test suite", "basis translation"], "summary_hash": "a09be552b537", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:26:13+00:00"}
