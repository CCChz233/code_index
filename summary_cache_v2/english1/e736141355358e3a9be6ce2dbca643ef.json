{"summary": "Implements a variational autoencoder whose latent space is regularized with a KL term and that incorporates SPADE‑based semantic conditioning. The architecture is configurable for 1‑D, 2‑D or 3‑D data, supports stacked residual blocks, attention mechanisms and optional non‑local attention in both encoder and decoder, and produces latent embeddings of a specified dimension.", "business_intent": "Provides a reusable, high‑resolution generative backbone for diffusion‑based image or brain‑scan synthesis pipelines, allowing users to train or deploy conditional generation models that reconstruct inputs and sample new data guided by semantic maps.", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "KL regularization", "SPADE normalization", "semantic conditioning", "latent diffusion", "residual blocks", "attention", "non‑local attention", "multi‑dimensional", "image synthesis", "brain imaging generation"], "summary_hash": "a4dd06792f96", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:44:10+00:00"}
