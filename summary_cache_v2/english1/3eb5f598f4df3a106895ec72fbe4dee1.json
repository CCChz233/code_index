{"summary": "Provides example scripts that illustrate how to fine‑tune causal language models with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using the TRL library. The scripts cover loading and tokenizing datasets, configuring a language model, setting up a reward model, initializing a PPO trainer, and running a reinforcement‑learning training loop, including a specialized version for generating concise TL;DR summaries.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate the practical application of PPO‑based reinforcement learning for language model adaptation, enabling developers to implement RLHF‑style fine‑tuning for custom tasks such as general response improvement and TL;DR generation.", "keywords": ["PPO", "reinforcement learning", "language model fine-tuning", "TRL library", "reward model", "tokenization", "dataset preparation", "TL;DR summarization", "causal LM", "training loop"], "summary_hash": "2f17d184bc6c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:03:49+00:00"}
