{"summary": "Implements a dockable PyQt5 widget that lets users configure remote‑sensing overlays. The widget performs geometric calculations needed for satellite observations—view and body angles, solar illumination, tangent‑line geometry, and coordinate transformations—while exposing visual settings such as colour maps and line styles.", "business_intent": "Enable end‑users of the MSS application to accurately visualise and analyse remote‑sensing data by providing an interactive control panel that computes observation geometry and updates map overlays in real time.", "keywords": ["remote sensing", "dock widget", "PyQt5", "geometric calculations", "view angle", "solar angle", "tangent line", "coordinate transformation", "overlay configuration", "visual customization", "matplotlib", "skyfield", "Earth radius"], "summary_hash": "11b6df0e3296", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:50:48+00:00"}
