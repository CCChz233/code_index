{"summary": "This module implements the G.711 audio codec family, providing encoder and decoder classes for PCM, PCMA (A-law) and PCMU (µ-law). It handles conversion between linear PCM samples and G.711 byte streams, integrates with AV frames and jitter buffering, and supports real‑time packetization for voice transmission.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable audio encoding and decoding in real‑time communication systems such as WebRTC and VoIP, ensuring compatibility with telephony equipment and efficient transmission of voice data over RTP.", "keywords": ["G.711", "PCM", "A-law", "mu-law", "audio codec", "encoder", "decoder", "real-time communication", "WebRTC", "VoIP", "audio frame", "sample conversion", "packetization"], "summary_hash": "326c16afe6d9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:48:04+00:00"}
