{"summary": "BaseEstimatorV1 is the foundational primitive that evaluates the expectation value of one or more parameterized quantum circuits with respect to given observables. It accepts lists of circuits, observables, and corresponding parameter sets, creates a job object, and delivers the computed expectation values together with optional metadata such as confidence intervals.", "business_intent": "Enable quantum software developers to obtain expectation values required by variational algorithms and other quantum workflows in a standardized, asynchronous manner, facilitating integration with Qiskit back‑ends and downstream analysis.", "keywords": ["quantum estimator", "expectation value", "parameterized circuits", "observables", "Qiskit", "job handling", "variational algorithms", "quantum computing", "primitive"], "summary_hash": "15be14ffaea3", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:40:05+00:00"}
