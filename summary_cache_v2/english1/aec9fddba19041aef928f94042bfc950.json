The word \"preprocess\" is a method name, but also a generic term. The constraint says \"Do NOT list method names verbatim.\" It might be okay to use \"preprocess\" as a verb? But it's ambiguous.

Use \"decrement label indices\". Avoid \"post_process_semantic_segmentation\". Use \"finalize segmentation output\". Avoid \"from_dict\". Use \"load configuration from dictionary\". Avoid \"call\".
