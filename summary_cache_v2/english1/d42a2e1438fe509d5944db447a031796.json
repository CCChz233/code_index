{"summary": "The module provides a tutorial implementation of a Line Graph Neural Network (LGNN) using DGL and PyTorch. It demonstrates how to construct a line graph from a citation dataset, defines GNN layers that process both the original graph and its line‑graph counterpart, and includes utilities for data loading, preprocessing, sparse matrix conversion, and visualization, all aimed at illustrating the concepts of multi‑graph message passing.", "business_intent": "Offer an educational example that showcases how to build and train a line‑graph‑based GNN, helping users understand multi‑graph processing and sparse operations in DGL, rather than delivering a production‑ready model.", "keywords": ["line graph neural network", "LGNN", "DGL", "PyTorch", "graph neural network", "multi‑graph message passing", "sparse matrix operations", "citation network", "tutorial", "educational example"], "summary_hash": "a44b9460f116", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:47:27+00:00"}
