{"summary": "The class generates an embossing transformation that applies a 3×3 convolution kernel to highlight edges and produce a 3‑D‑like texture. It blends the original image with the embossed version using a randomly chosen alpha within a specified range and modulates the effect intensity with a strength parameter. The transform is applied with a configurable probability.", "business_intent": "To enrich image datasets for computer‑vision training or to create stylized visuals by emphasizing edge structures, thereby improving model robustness to edge‑related features or providing artistic effects.", "keywords": ["emboss", "convolution kernel", "edge enhancement", "image augmentation", "alpha blending", "strength control", "probability", "3D texture", "artistic effect", "data augmentation"], "summary_hash": "d1df97decac4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:19:38+00:00"}
