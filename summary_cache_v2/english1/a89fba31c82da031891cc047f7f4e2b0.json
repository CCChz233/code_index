{"summary": "Implements a complete DeepWalk pipeline that loads graph data (including OGB datasets), generates random walks, trains a skip‑gram model with negative sampling using PyTorch and DGL, and supports multiprocessing, mixed CPU/GPU, and multi‑GPU execution. It also provides command‑line configuration, embedding export in various formats, and utilities for evaluation on downstream tasks.", "business_intent": "Enable fast, scalable learning of node embeddings for large graphs, allowing users to leverage CPU and GPU resources for downstream applications such as node classification and link prediction.", "keywords": ["DeepWalk", "graph embedding", "random walk", "skip-gram", "negative sampling", "PyTorch", "DGL", "multi‑GPU", "multiprocessing", "OGB", "link prediction", "node classification", "embedding export"], "summary_hash": "e20709e8ca37", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:56:19+00:00"}
