{"summary": "This module provides utilities for optimizing Dask DataFrame task graphs. It includes helpers to detect selection operations and determine their type, and an optimization routine that applies blockwise fusion, task culling, and other graph‑level transformations to streamline DataFrame computations, especially for column and row selections.", "business_intent": "Enhance the efficiency and speed of large‑scale DataFrame processing pipelines by reducing computational overhead through graph optimizations, leading to faster data analysis and lower resource consumption.", "keywords": ["dask", "dataframe", "optimization", "graph", "blockwise", "task fusion", "culling", "selection", "performance", "high‑level graph"], "summary_hash": "e9c283e38405", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:21:30+00:00"}
