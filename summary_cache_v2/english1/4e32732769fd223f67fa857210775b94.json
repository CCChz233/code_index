{"summary": "The module implements the data pipeline for a token‑based text‑normalization tagging approach. It defines the core tagging structures, utilities for token extraction, alignment and label handling, builds BERT‑compatible examples, and provides dataset classes that read TSV token‑tag pairs for training or inference with the Thutmose tagger model.", "business_intent": "Support the development of speech‑oriented NLP systems by supplying ready‑to‑use data representations and loaders that enable models to learn how to convert written text into its spoken form, improving voice assistants, TTS, and other speech applications.", "keywords": ["text normalization", "token tagging", "BERT", "dataset", "NLP", "speech synthesis", "voice assistants", "Thutmose", "data preprocessing", "semiotic class"], "summary_hash": "f26f162a65fa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:09:53+00:00"}
