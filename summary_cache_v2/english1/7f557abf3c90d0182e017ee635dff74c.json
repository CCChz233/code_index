{"summary": "This module provides a suite of unit tests that validate the behavior of the code‑representation utilities in the library. The tests exercise helpers that convert various Python objects—such as plain arguments, NumPy arrays, Astropy quantities, and object attributes—into readable code strings, and they verify the construction of function and method call signatures, including handling of units and warnings.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the library’s utilities for producing reproducible, human‑readable code snippets work correctly, thereby supporting debugging, logging, documentation, and reproducibility of scientific calculations.", "keywords": ["testing", "code representation", "string formatting", "function call signature", "method call signature", "NumPy array", "Astropy quantity", "unit handling", "warnings", "debugging", "reproducibility"], "summary_hash": "c75b375e597f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:06:01+00:00"}
