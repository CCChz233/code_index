{"summary": "The module implements a training workflow for fine‑tuning the Stable Diffusion XL text‑to‑image model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). It handles argument parsing, model and tokenizer loading, dataset preparation, prompt tokenization, preprocessing, collating batches, setting up distributed training with Accelerate, configuring optimizers and learning‑rate schedules, optionally performing validation, and saving model checkpoints.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑use pipeline that enables organizations to improve the alignment and quality of text‑to‑image generation by training custom diffusion models on preference data, facilitating better user satisfaction and faster deployment of tailored generative AI solutions.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion XL", "Direct Preference Optimization", "diffusion model fine‑tuning", "text‑to‑image generation", "LoRA adapters", "distributed training", "Accelerate library", "Hugging Face", "WandB logging", "model checkpointing", "dataset preprocessing", "prompt tokenization"], "summary_hash": "14a0d4bfc52d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:38:14+00:00"}
