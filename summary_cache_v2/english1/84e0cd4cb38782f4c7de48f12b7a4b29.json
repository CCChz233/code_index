{"summary": "This module constructs and maintains the topological connectivity structures of an unstructured UGRID mesh. It provides high‑performance helpers—leveraging NumPy and Numba—to generate adjacency arrays linking faces, edges, and nodes, convert face‑node relationships into sparse matrices, replace fill values, and expose partition information for downstream use.", "business_intent": "Enable scientific and engineering workflows that require rapid navigation of mesh elements (e.g., climate modeling, ocean simulation, visualization) by supplying pre‑computed connectivity tables that improve computational efficiency and data integrity.", "keywords": ["connectivity", "UGRID", "unstructured mesh", "adjacency", "faces", "edges", "nodes", "sparse matrix", "fill values", "topology", "Numba", "NumPy"], "summary_hash": "2aea5b721a1c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:27:25+00:00"}
