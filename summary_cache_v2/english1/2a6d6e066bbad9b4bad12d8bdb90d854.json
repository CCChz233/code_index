{"summary": "The module is a command‑line program that loads an OGB node‑property prediction dataset, builds a GraphSAGE model with DGL and PyTorch, and trains it using cluster‑based mini‑batch sampling. It handles argument parsing, data loading, model initialization, training loops with Adam optimization, periodic evaluation of validation and test accuracy, and optional multi‑process execution.", "business_intent": "Provide a reproducible example and benchmark for training GraphSAGE on large‑scale graph datasets (e.g., Reddit, OGB) using DGL and PyTorch, helping researchers and engineers evaluate node‑level prediction performance and experiment with scalable graph learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["GraphSAGE", "DGL", "PyTorch", "OGB", "node property prediction", "cluster sampling", "mini‑batch training", "distributed training", "benchmark", "graph neural networks"], "summary_hash": "9bc23b8ccad2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:29:36+00:00"}
