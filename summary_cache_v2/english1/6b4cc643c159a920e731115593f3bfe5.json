{"summary": "This module defines a suite of unit tests that validate the core functionality of the xclim bias adjustment library. It exercises various adjustment algorithms—including detrended quantile mapping, empirical quantile mapping, LOCI, quantile delta mapping, and scaling—checking statistical properties, group handling, correction application, and behavior with chunked data structures.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the correctness and robustness of climate bias correction tools, enabling reliable climate data preprocessing for research, impact assessments, and decision‑making workflows.", "keywords": ["bias adjustment", "quantile mapping", "LOCI", "scaling", "unit testing", "xarray", "numpy", "scipy", "statistical validation", "chunked data", "climate data processing"], "summary_hash": "b0dc2441d8af", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:33:42+00:00"}
