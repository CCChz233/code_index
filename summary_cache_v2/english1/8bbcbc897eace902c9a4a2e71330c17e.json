{"summary": "Implements a question‑answering head tailored for SQuAD‑style span prediction, built on top of a pretrained transformer configuration. It extracts the model's hidden size and normalization epsilon from the config, constructs the necessary linear and normalization layers, and processes encoder outputs to generate start and end position scores.", "business_intent": "Enable fine‑tuning of transformer models for reading‑comprehension applications by providing a ready‑to‑use answer‑span prediction component.", "keywords": ["SQuAD", "question answering", "XLNet", "transformer head", "span prediction", "start logits", "end logits", "layer normalization", "hidden size", "pretrained config"], "summary_hash": "a04a8c8242a6", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:24:54+00:00"}
