{"summary": "The module defines a hierarchy of node objects that model the elements of a quantum circuit within a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. It provides a generic base node with common behavior, specialized nodes for incoming wires, outgoing wires, and quantum operations, as well as utility helpers for constructing DAGs from circuits and comparing node semantics.", "business_intent": "To supply a flexible, graph‑based representation of quantum circuits that supports analysis, transformation, and optimization workflows in quantum computing software.", "keywords": ["DAG", "quantum circuit", "graph representation", "node hierarchy", "operation node", "input node", "output node", "circuit transformation", "optimization", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "39e8f9425438", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:51:26+00:00"}
