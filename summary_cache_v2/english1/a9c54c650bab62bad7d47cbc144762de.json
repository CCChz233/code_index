Handles configuration, timesteps, noise addition, scaling, state management, stepping through diffusion process using PLMS and PRK steps. Provides ability to skip PRK steps, set alpha to one, offset steps, choose prediction type, dtype. Business intent: provide efficient and accurate scheduler for diffusion model inference, enabling advanced ODE integration for generative AI pipelines. Keywords: diffusion, scheduler, PNDM, Runge-Kutta, linear multi-step, JAX/Flax, noise schedule, inference, timesteps, PLMS, PRK, configuration.\n\nMake sure not to list method names verbatim.

It computes the noise schedule, scales model inputs, maintains internal state across steps, and updates samples using either a linear multi‑step (PLMS) or Runge‑Kutta (PRK) integration scheme, with options to skip PRK steps, adjust alpha handling, and offset timesteps. Designed for JAX/Flax models.\n\nBusiness intent: Provide a high‑performance, configurable scheduler for diffusion model inference in generative AI applications, enabling faster and more accurate sample generation by leveraging advanced ODE solvers.\n\nKeywords list.\n\nLet's produce JSON.\n\nMake sure to escape quotes properly.\n\nReturn only JSON.\n\nLet's craft final answer.\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Implements a diffusion scheduler based on pseudo‑numerical methods (PNDM) that drives the reverse diffusion process using advanced ODE integration techniques such as Runge‑Kutta and linear multi‑step (PLMS).
