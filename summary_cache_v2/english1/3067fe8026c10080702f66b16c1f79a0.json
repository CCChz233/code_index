{"summary": "The module showcases an example implementation of a Stable Diffusion 3 differential image‑to‑image pipeline. It assembles the necessary models (VAE, transformer, CLIP, T5), handles image preprocessing, extracts latent representations and timesteps, and runs the diffusion process to generate edited images conditioned on textual prompts and reference images.", "business_intent": "Provide developers with a reference for building custom image generation or editing applications using the Diffusers library, enabling use cases such as style transfer, image refinement, and creative content creation powered by Stable Diffusion 3.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion 3", "image-to-image", "differential guidance", "diffusion pipeline", "latent extraction", "timesteps", "torch", "transformers", "CLIP", "T5", "VAE", "scheduler"], "summary_hash": "93059ee77209", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:00:25+00:00"}
