{"summary": "Defines an abstract base class that encapsulates the core logic for different training strategies in a deep‑learning framework, handling model and optimizer preparation, device and precision configuration, distributed execution, checkpoint I/O, and lifecycle hooks for training, validation and testing. Also provides a wrapper to redirect module forward calls for custom preprocessing/postprocessing.", "business_intent": "Offer a flexible, extensible foundation that lets developers plug in various execution strategies (single‑GPU, multi‑GPU, TPU, etc.) while abstracting away device placement, precision handling, and checkpoint management, thereby simplifying the implementation of robust training pipelines.", "keywords": ["strategy", "abstract base class", "model setup", "optimizer setup", "device placement", "distributed training", "precision handling", "checkpoint management", "training lifecycle", "validation", "testing", "PyTorch Lightning", "forward redirection", "plugin", "launcher"], "summary_hash": "06115c62651b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:52:28+00:00"}
