{"summary": "Implements a diffusion pipeline that converts textual prompts into images using the Stable Diffusion XL model, enhanced with ControlNet conditioning and optional adapters such as LoRA, textual inversion, and IP adapters. The pipeline manages prompt encoding, image preprocessing, latent preparation, guidance scaling, denoising via the UNet, and decoding through the VAE, supporting watermarking and various schedulers.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to generate high‑quality, controllable images from text for applications in advertising, design, entertainment, and other creative domains, offering extensibility through adapters and fine‑tuning techniques.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion XL", "ControlNet", "text-to-image", "diffusion pipeline", "latent generation", "VAE", "UNet", "scheduler", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "IP adapter", "watermark", "AI art", "image generation"], "summary_hash": "eb6120bfd03c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:17:22+00:00"}
