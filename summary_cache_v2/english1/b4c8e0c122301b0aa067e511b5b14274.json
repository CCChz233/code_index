{"summary": "The script demonstrates how to configure and launch pre‑training of a Megatron‑RETRO language model using NeMo, Hydra, and PyTorch Lightning. It registers custom optimizers, sets up mixed‑precision and distributed training plugins, builds the retrieval‑augmented model, and runs the training loop.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example for researchers and engineers to train large, retrieval‑augmented language models efficiently on multi‑GPU clusters, facilitating experimentation with advanced optimizers and precision settings.", "keywords": ["Megatron", "RETRO", "language modeling", "pretraining", "retrieval augmentation", "NeMo", "Hydra", "PyTorch Lightning", "distributed training", "mixed precision", "MuAdam", "MuAdamW"], "summary_hash": "8acc120e9ba4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:43:56+00:00"}
