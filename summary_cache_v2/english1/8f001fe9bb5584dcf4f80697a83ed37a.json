{"summary": "The module implements a lexical analyzer for GLSL shader source code. It defines the language keywords and token patterns, uses regular expressions to scan raw shader text, and produces a stream of token objects that can be consumed by subsequent parsing or compilation stages.", "business_intent": "Enable reliable parsing and processing of OpenGL shader programs within the graphics engine, facilitating tasks such as validation, transformation, and compilation of GLSL code.", "keywords": ["GLSL", "lexer", "tokenization", "shader", "OpenGL", "regular expressions", "compiler front‑end", "syntax analysis"], "summary_hash": "02759dcb5949", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:36:40+00:00"}
