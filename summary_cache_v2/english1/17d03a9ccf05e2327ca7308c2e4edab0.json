{"summary": "Provides a Keras layer that computes the maximum value across the height and width dimensions of a 4‑D tensor, reducing each channel to a single scalar (or a 1×1 spatial map when keepdims is true).", "business_intent": "Allows neural networks to compress spatial feature maps into a compact per‑channel descriptor, preserving the most salient activation for each channel and simplifying the transition to dense layers or other downstream components.", "keywords": ["global max pooling", "2D data", "spatial reduction", "channel aggregation", "keep dimensions", "data format", "channels_last", "channels_first", "Keras layer", "tensor operation"], "summary_hash": "3f5a328c03e8", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T12:02:12+00:00"}
