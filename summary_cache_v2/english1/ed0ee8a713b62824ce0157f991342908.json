{"summary": "The ConvFeatureEncoder class implements a convolutional front‑end that transforms raw audio waveforms into a sequence of high‑level feature vectors suitable for Wav2Vec‑style self‑supervised speech models. It stacks configurable convolutional blocks, applies optional layer normalization, and tracks sequence lengths, acting as a preprocessing module within NeMo ASR pipelines.", "business_intent": "Enable stable and efficient extraction of acoustic features from raw audio for downstream speech‑recognition training and inference, supporting self‑supervised models such as Wav2Vec.", "keywords": ["audio feature extraction", "convolutional encoder", "wav2vec", "speech recognition", "NeMo ASR", "layer normalization", "preprocessing module", "convolutional blocks", "self‑supervised learning"], "summary_hash": "132352ce9cfc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:11:43+00:00"}
