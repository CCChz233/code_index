{"summary": "The class encapsulates a General‑Head Boundary condition for MODFLOW‑6 simulations, storing the boundary head, hydraulic conductance, and optional solute concentration data. It manages configuration flags for printing and saving flow information, validates input arrays, supports repeat‑stress patterns for seasonal or cyclic loading, and integrates with transport packages by handling concentration boundary types.", "business_intent": "Enable modelers to define and control head‑dependent flux boundaries in groundwater flow simulations, including coupling with solute transport, while providing flexible output options and repeatable stress period handling to streamline model setup and analysis.", "keywords": ["General Head Boundary", "head‑dependent flux", "hydraulic conductance", "groundwater modeling", "MODFLOW 6", "solute transport coupling", "repeat stress", "input validation", "output control", "boundary condition"], "summary_hash": "e96a1283ec3d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:36:36+00:00"}
