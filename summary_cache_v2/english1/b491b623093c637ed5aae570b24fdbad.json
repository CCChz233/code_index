{"summary": "The module contains unit tests for software composition analysis (SCA) utilities, verifying the language‑normalization helper and the output generation functions. Tests cover handling of empty inputs, unsupported language values, and specific language identifiers (e.g., Python, Ruby, Gem), as well as the creation of request payloads and processing of license‑status responses using mocked HTTP interactions.", "business_intent": "Ensure that SCA helper components correctly map language identifiers and construct API payloads, and that license status handling works reliably, thereby preventing integration errors in composition analysis workflows.", "keywords": ["software composition analysis", "unit tests", "language normalization", "payload generation", "license status", "mock HTTP", "Python", "Ruby", "Gem", "test coverage"], "summary_hash": "652af8ecb86f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T22:25:11+00:00"}
