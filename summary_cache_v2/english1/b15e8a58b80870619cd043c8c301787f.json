{"summary": "The module defines a suite of lightweight PyTorch nn.Module layers that implement classic image processing filters (Gaussian, Laplacian, mean, median, sharpening, Savitzky‑Golay, elliptical), signal transforms (Hilbert), channel padding, flattening, reshaping, and configurable skip connections, as well as a simple recurrent cell (LLTM), providing ready‑to‑use building blocks for constructing medical imaging deep‑learning models.", "business_intent": "Offer developers of medical imaging AI a collection of plug‑in layers that encapsulate common filtering, morphological, and architectural operations, simplifying model design and reducing the need for custom implementations.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "nn.Module", "image filters", "Gaussian", "Laplacian", "median", "mean", "sharpen", "Savitzky‑Golay", "elliptical", "Hilbert transform", "channel padding", "flatten", "reshape", "skip connection", "LLTM", "medical imaging", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "c6f08837f2a1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:16:33+00:00"}
