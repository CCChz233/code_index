{"summary": "The module implements a command‑line training utility for a simple neural network that classifies MNIST handwritten digits using PyTorch. It defines the model architecture, loads the MNIST dataset, sets up an optimizer and learning‑rate scheduler, parses training parameters, and executes the training loop, optionally leveraging Fabric for distributed execution.", "business_intent": "Provide a ready‑to‑run example that lets users quickly train and evaluate a basic image classification model on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating how to integrate PyTorch training code with Fabric for scalable experimentation.", "keywords": ["PyTorch", "MNIST", "image classification", "training script", "neural network", "optimizer", "learning rate scheduler", "Fabric", "command line", "dataset loading"], "summary_hash": "03d2b312f0f2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:50:56+00:00"}
