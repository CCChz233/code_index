{"summary": "This module supplies a collection of statistical and hypothesis‑testing utilities for Dask arrays, mirroring the interface of SciPy's stats package. It implements distributed versions of common tests such as t‑tests, chi‑square, kurtosis, skewness, and related helper calculations, leveraging Dask's delayed execution and element‑wise wrappers.", "business_intent": "Enable scalable, parallel statistical analysis on large out‑of‑core datasets by providing Dask‑compatible implementations of standard statistical tests and descriptive measures.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "statistics", "hypothesis testing", "t-test", "chi-square", "kurtosis", "skewness", "distributed computing", "parallel processing"], "summary_hash": "b46c2ee1dffb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:17:50+00:00"}
