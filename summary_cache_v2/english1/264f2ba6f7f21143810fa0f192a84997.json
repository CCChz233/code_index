{"summary": "A container class that aggregates all results produced by a multimodal alignment model, including optional contrastive loss, image‑to‑text and text‑to‑image similarity scores, the corresponding embeddings, and the raw outputs of the underlying text and vision sub‑models. It also offers a lightweight way to represent these fields as a simple tuple.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream applications such as cross‑modal retrieval, ranking, or further training steps to easily access loss values, similarity logits, and embeddings in a unified structure, simplifying integration and post‑processing of multimodal model outputs.", "keywords": ["multimodal", "alignment", "loss", "similarity scores", "embeddings", "image-text", "vision model output", "text model output", "torch", "output container", "tuple conversion"], "summary_hash": "5be42ef01437", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:47:43+00:00"}
