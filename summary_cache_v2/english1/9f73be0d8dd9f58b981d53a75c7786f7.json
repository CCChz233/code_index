{"summary": "A script that fine‑tunes the GPT‑J‑6B causal language model using Proximal Policy Optimization to lower the toxicity of its generated text. It prepares a text dataset, tokenizes and filters it, employs a toxicity classifier as a reward signal, constructs reference and value‑head models, and runs a PPO training loop that updates the language model based on the classifier’s scores.", "business_intent": "To enhance the safety and compliance of AI‑generated content by reducing harmful or toxic language, enabling more responsible deployment of large language models in consumer‑facing applications.", "keywords": ["GPT-J-6B", "Proximal Policy Optimization", "toxicity mitigation", "language model fine‑tuning", "reward model", "reinforcement learning", "text dataset preprocessing", "tokenization", "value head", "reference model"], "summary_hash": "ed35f98b509c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:03:37+00:00"}
