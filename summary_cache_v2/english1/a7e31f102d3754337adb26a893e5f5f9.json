{"summary": "This module supplies utilities for generating graphical visualizations of a quantum device's topology, including its qubit connectivity, layout of a circuit on the device, and error rates associated with qubits and couplings. It provides helper routines for coloring graph elements based on data values and determines backend interface versions to select appropriate visualization back‑ends.", "business_intent": "Enable users of the quantum computing framework to inspect and analyze hardware coupling structures and error characteristics through clear visual plots, facilitating circuit mapping, performance assessment, and debugging of quantum programs.", "keywords": ["visualization", "quantum hardware", "coupling map", "graph layout", "error map", "backend properties", "Qiskit", "rustworkx", "graph coloring", "device topology"], "summary_hash": "244407a24c2b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:49:53+00:00"}
