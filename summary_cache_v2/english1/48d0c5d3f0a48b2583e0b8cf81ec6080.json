{"summary": "The module provides a framework for generating class activation maps from PyTorch models. It defines a base class for extracting convolutional feature maps via forward and backward hooks, and implements specific algorithms such as CAM, Grad‑CAM, and Grad‑CAM++ to compute class‑specific heatmaps that are upsampled and optionally normalized for overlay on the original input.", "business_intent": "To give developers and medical imaging researchers a ready‑to‑use tool for visualizing and interpreting deep learning model predictions, thereby improving model transparency, debugging, and clinical trustworthiness.", "keywords": ["class activation map", "Grad-CAM", "Grad-CAM++", "visualization", "deep learning interpretability", "PyTorch hooks", "heatmap overlay", "medical imaging AI", "model explanation", "feature map extraction"], "summary_hash": "9b155ff8d204", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:08:36+00:00"}
