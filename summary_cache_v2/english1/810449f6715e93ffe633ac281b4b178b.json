{"summary": "The backends package defines a unified interface and helper utilities that abstract over multiple model libraries (Diffusers, Timm, Transformers). It supplies a base class for loading models, extracting tensor shapes, handling configurations, and saving weights, along with specific utilities for each library and optional PEFT adapter integration. This enables the benchmarking framework to work with heterogeneous model sources through a consistent API.", "business_intent": "Provide a standardized, extensible layer that simplifies the setup and execution of performance benchmarks across diverse deep‑learning model ecosystems, ensuring consistent configuration, resource detection, and model handling regardless of the underlying library.", "keywords": ["benchmarking", "model backend abstraction", "Diffusers", "timm", "Transformers", "configuration management", "PEFT integration", "model loading", "shape extraction", "resource detection"], "summary_hash": "7ede4a34db06", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:32:19+00:00"}
