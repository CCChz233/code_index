{"summary": "A single‑qubit gate that performs a rotation about an arbitrary axis defined by a three‑component vector, where the vector’s Euclidean norm determines the rotation angle, and the unitary is given by the exponential of the Pauli‑vector dot product.", "business_intent": "Provides a flexible primitive for quantum circuit construction, allowing developers to express any axis rotation directly in Qiskit and to integrate such rotations into algorithms, compilation, and simulation workflows.", "keywords": ["single-qubit", "arbitrary axis rotation", "vector‑parameterized gate", "unitary matrix", "quantum circuit", "Qiskit", "Pauli rotation", "gate synthesis"], "summary_hash": "d313c2b5763c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:35:40+00:00"}
