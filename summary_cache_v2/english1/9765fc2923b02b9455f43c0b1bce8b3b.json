{"summary": "Unit test module that verifies the behavior of a random cropping transform which selects regions based on positive and negative label presence. It checks proper handling of data type conversion to meta tensors, lazy (pending) operation execution, and ensures the output tensors have expected types and shapes across various input configurations.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the reliability of a medical image preprocessing step that performs label‑aware random cropping, supporting both eager and lazy execution modes, to maintain data integrity in downstream deep learning pipelines.", "keywords": ["random cropping", "label‑aware augmentation", "unit testing", "MONAI", "MetaTensor", "lazy evaluation", "dtype conversion", "shape validation", "parameterized tests", "medical imaging preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "e51b0206888f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:54:01+00:00"}
