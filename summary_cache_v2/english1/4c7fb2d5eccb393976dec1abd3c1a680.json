{"summary": "This module implements an extensible plugin framework for the Qiskit transpiler's preset pass‑manager stages. It defines an abstract base that developers subclass to provide a stage‑specific PassManager, a manager that discovers and loads such plugins through setuptools entry points, and helper utilities to enumerate available stage implementations.", "business_intent": "Allow external packages to contribute custom compilation strategies—such as layout selection, routing, gate translation, optimization, or scheduling—to Qiskit’s transpilation pipeline, making the quantum circuit compilation process modular, configurable, and easily extensible by third‑party developers.", "keywords": ["Qiskit", "transpiler", "plugin system", "pass manager", "stage extension", "setuptools entry points", "modular compilation", "quantum circuit optimization", "layout routing scheduling", "extensibility"], "summary_hash": "140a40b33ee1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:23:19+00:00"}
