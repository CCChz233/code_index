{"summary": "Provides a resolver that manages a set of configuration items, guarantees unique identifiers, and replaces reference strings (using a leading '@' and optional '::' path) with the actual Python objects. It recursively walks nested dictionaries and lists, instantiates classes, evaluates expressions, and caches resolved objects for efficiency.", "business_intent": "Facilitates MONAI bundle workflows by allowing declarative configuration files where components can reference each other, automatically materializing a fully instantiated pipeline from those references.", "keywords": ["configuration", "reference resolution", "MONAI", "bundle", "unique identifiers", "expression evaluation", "class instantiation", "caching", "nested structures", "dictionary traversal", "list traversal"], "summary_hash": "9e1fd9d0eaaf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:07:56+00:00"}
