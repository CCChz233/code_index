{"summary": "Implements a composite loss that computes Generalized Dice Loss and Focal Loss on model predictions, with optional activation functions, background exclusion, one‑hot conversion, class weighting, batch aggregation, and configurable reduction, then returns their weighted average based on user‑defined trade‑off coefficients.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible loss function for training segmentation models, particularly in medical imaging, that simultaneously mitigates class imbalance and emphasizes difficult examples, improving model accuracy and robustness.", "keywords": ["loss function", "generalized dice loss", "focal loss", "segmentation", "class imbalance", "hard example mining", "activation", "weighting", "reduction", "medical imaging", "PyTorch", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "8999c96fddcc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:27:14+00:00"}
