{"summary": "A Keras metric that determines the highest possible specificity while guaranteeing that sensitivity meets or exceeds a user‑defined target. It computes confusion‑matrix components across a configurable set of thresholds, optionally applies sample weights and focuses on a specific class, and returns the specificity corresponding to the threshold that satisfies the sensitivity constraint.", "business_intent": "Enable practitioners to assess binary (or multi‑class) classifiers under a sensitivity requirement, ensuring critical positive cases are captured while maximizing true‑negative rate, which is valuable in regulated or safety‑critical applications such as healthcare, fraud detection, or quality control.", "keywords": ["specificity", "sensitivity", "threshold", "binary classification", "Keras metric", "weighted samples", "class_id", "confusion matrix", "model evaluation", "true positives", "false negatives", "true negatives", "false positives"], "summary_hash": "473557180a94", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:47:35+00:00"}
