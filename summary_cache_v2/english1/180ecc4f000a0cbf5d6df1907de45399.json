{"summary": "The module defines a scenario class that runs the full health system model repeatedly, each time excluding a different treatment identifier, under conditions of maximum healthcare capacity and full care‑seeking behavior. It configures model parameters, logs the setup, mixes scenario configurations, and orchestrates execution on batch or local environments.", "business_intent": "To quantify the contribution of each individual treatment to health outcomes when the health system operates at peak capacity, enabling decision‑makers to prioritize resources and understand the impact of removing specific interventions.", "keywords": ["health system modeling", "treatment effect analysis", "scenario simulation", "maximum capacity", "full care seeking", "treatment exclusion", "parameter sampling", "model orchestration", "batch execution"], "summary_hash": "a5ca728b1857", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:05:39+00:00"}
