{"summary": "The module contains a collection of unit tests that verify the correctness and robustness of CuPy's statistical correlation and covariance functions. It checks standard calculations, handling of special cases such as diagonal entries, row‑wise orientation, mixed data types, non‑contiguous arrays, shape combinations, and proper error handling for invalid inputs.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the functionality of GPU‑accelerated correlation utilities in the CuPy library, ensuring they produce accurate results, handle edge cases gracefully, and raise appropriate exceptions, thereby maintaining reliability for scientific computing applications.", "keywords": ["CuPy", "correlation", "covariance", "unit testing", "GPU", "statistical functions", "error handling", "shape validation", "numpy compatibility", "software quality"], "summary_hash": "e7563ec4b955", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T20:28:57+00:00"}
