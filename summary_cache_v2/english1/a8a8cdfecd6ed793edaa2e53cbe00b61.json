{"summary": "This module supplies utility classes and helpers that adapt DeepSpeed components to the Accelerate framework. It wraps DeepSpeed's engine, optimizer, and scheduler to expose a conventional training‑loop API, provides dummy optimizer and scheduler placeholders for configuration compatibility, and defines a configuration helper for DeepSpeed settings. A getter function retrieves the currently active DeepSpeed plugin.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless integration of DeepSpeed into Accelerate-powered training pipelines by abstracting DeepSpeed specifics behind a uniform interface, simplifying distributed training setup, and ensuring compatibility with standard training code even when only DeepSpeed configuration is supplied.", "keywords": ["DeepSpeed", "Accelerate", "training loop", "engine wrapper", "optimizer wrapper", "scheduler wrapper", "dummy optimizer", "dummy scheduler", "configuration", "distributed training", "plugin"], "summary_hash": "6885df5d6f26", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:18:21+00:00"}
