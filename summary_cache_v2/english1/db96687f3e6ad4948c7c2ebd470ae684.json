{"summary": "This module contains test utilities and test cases that verify Dask array's compliance with NumPy's dispatch protocols (__array_function__ and __array_ufunc__). It defines lightweight wrapper classes for NumPy ndarrays, custom scalars, and Dask arrays to simulate external array-like objects, and includes tests that check type precedence, delegation behavior, and chunk validation logic.", "business_intent": "Validate and ensure that Dask array operations correctly delegate to and interoperate with NumPy's array protocol mechanisms, thereby guaranteeing reliable behavior when Dask arrays are used alongside custom array-like objects in scientific computing workflows.", "keywords": ["dask", "array", "dispatch", "numpy", "__array_function__", "__array_ufunc__", "testing", "wrapper", "custom scalar", "chunk validation", "binary operation precedence"], "summary_hash": "3aa735aae794", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:22:52+00:00"}
