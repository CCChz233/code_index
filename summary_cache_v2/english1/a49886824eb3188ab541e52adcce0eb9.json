{"summary": "The module implements context‑biasing support for CTC‑based automatic speech recognition. It supplies utilities for evaluating biasing performance and merging alignment data, constructs a prefix‑tree graph that integrates CTC blank transitions for representing target words or phrases, and provides a CTC‑based word‑spotting engine that uses token passing, beam pruning and hypothesis scoring to detect and rank the desired terms during decoding.", "business_intent": "Enable applications to improve recognition of specific keywords or phrases in spoken audio, such as voice assistants, call‑center monitoring, or transcription services, by biasing the ASR decoder toward user‑defined vocabularies and delivering accurate detection of those terms.", "keywords": ["context biasing", "automatic speech recognition", "CTC", "word spotting", "prefix tree graph", "beam pruning", "hypothesis tracking", "evaluation metrics", "alignment merging", "keyword detection"], "summary_hash": "b2aefc007653", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:06:38+00:00"}
