{"summary": "The module defines the configuration loading framework for Kedro. It provides an abstract base class that establishes the required interface and shared utilities for configuration loaders, along with custom exceptions for malformed or missing files. A concrete implementation uses OmegaConf to discover YAML/JSON files in designated directories, parses them, merges configurations respecting environment and directory precedence, validates against duplicate top‑level keys, and returns a unified configuration dictionary.", "business_intent": "To give Kedro projects a reliable, environment‑aware mechanism for aggregating configuration data (catalog, parameters, credentials, etc.) from multiple files, ensuring consistency, validation, and easy access throughout the pipeline.", "keywords": ["configuration", "loader", "OmegaConf", "YAML", "JSON", "environment-aware", "Kedro", "abstract base class", "error handling", "duplicate key detection"], "summary_hash": "a3b12426f63d", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:22:28+00:00"}
