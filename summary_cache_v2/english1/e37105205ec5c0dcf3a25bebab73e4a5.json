{"summary": "The module implements the NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication protocol, providing classes to construct, parse, and validate NTLM negotiate, challenge, and response messages, as well as HTTP-specific NTLM handling. It includes support for AV pairs, version flags, cryptographic operations such as LM/NTLM hash generation, DES encryption, HMAC-MD5, signing, and sealing, enabling secure challenge‑response authentication for network services.", "business_intent": "To supply developers with a comprehensive toolkit for performing NTLM authentication in client and server applications, facilitating secure access to services like SMB and HTTP that rely on the NTLM challenge‑response mechanism.", "keywords": ["NTLM", "authentication", "challenge-response", "HTTP", "SMB", "cryptography", "DES", "MD5", "HMAC", "signing", "sealing", "AV pairs", "negotiate", "response", "hash", "session key"], "summary_hash": "77b420198931", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:09:32+00:00"}
