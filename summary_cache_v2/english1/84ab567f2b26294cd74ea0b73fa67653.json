{"summary": "The module implements a distributed inference framework for large language models using TensorRT-LLM. It defines host and worker contexts that manage configuration, GPU resources, model loading, engine building/refitting, quantization, LoRA support, and communication via MPI, enabling efficient generation and streaming of model outputs.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑performance, scalable solution for deploying and serving large language models in production environments, leveraging GPU acceleration and multi‑node MPI orchestration to reduce latency and increase throughput.", "keywords": ["TensorRT", "LLM", "inference", "distributed", "MPI", "GPU", "quantization", "LoRA", "engine refit", "model loading", "sampling", "tokenizer"], "summary_hash": "30dc5af61d60", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:38:58+00:00"}
