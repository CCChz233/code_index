{"summary": "Implements a group‑wise residual vector quantizer that partitions an input embedding into multiple segments, assigns a dedicated set of codebooks to each segment, and performs independent residual quantization per group. It manages the calculation of per‑group dimensions and codebook counts, and provides encoding, decoding, and forward operations for the grouped quantization process.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑fidelity, low‑bitrate audio compression by applying efficient group‑residual vector quantization, facilitating compact representation and fast reconstruction of audio features for codecs and streaming services.", "keywords": ["group residual vector quantization", "codebooks", "audio compression", "high fidelity codec", "vector encoding", "vector decoding", "grouped quantization", "low bitrate"], "summary_hash": "f3631aa61d69", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:34:48+00:00"}
