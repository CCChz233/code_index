{"summary": "The module defines a CouplingMap class that models the directed connectivity graph of physical qubits on a quantum device. It provides graph‑style utilities such as adding nodes and edges, querying neighbors, computing distances and shortest paths, checking symmetry, extracting connected components, visualizing the topology, and generating common device layouts (grid, line, ring, hexagonal, heavy‑hex, etc.).", "business_intent": "Enable quantum circuit transpilation by supplying accurate device coupling information, allowing logical qubits to be mapped onto physical qubits with optimal routing and gate placement while respecting the allowed CNOT directions.", "keywords": ["quantum computing", "transpiler", "coupling map", "directed graph", "qubit connectivity", "device topology", "CNOT direction", "distance calculation", "routing", "visualization", "topology generation", "heavy-hex", "grid layout", "ring topology"], "summary_hash": "6bcf613bc4e4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:55:15+00:00"}
