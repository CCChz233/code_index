{"summary": "Implements a multiprocessing launcher that orchestrates multiple worker processes to run a target function on XLA‑compatible devices (e.g., TPUs). It handles process creation, rank allocation, device placement, result collection, synchronization, and graceful teardown of the workers.", "business_intent": "Enable PyTorch Lightning to execute training and inference workloads on XLA hardware in a distributed, multi‑process fashion, providing reliable process management and coordination for scalable TPU utilization.", "keywords": ["XLA", "TPU", "multiprocessing", "process management", "rank assignment", "result aggregation", "device placement", "distributed training", "PyTorch Lightning", "launcher", "synchronization", "worker processes", "cleanup"], "summary_hash": "3ca2d1acaed8", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:59:28+00:00"}
