{"summary": "This module implements a Qt‑based data model for flight tracks, representing a sequence of geographic waypoints with altitude and related attributes. It provides a lightweight waypoint object, a custom delegate for rendering and editing waypoint entries in a table view, and a table model that exposes the waypoint list to Qt views. The model supports inserting, removing, and reordering waypoints, computes distances between points and the total track length, and handles persistence to and from XML/FTML formats for integration with performance analysis tools.", "business_intent": "Enable users of the meteorological software suite to create, edit, visualize, and store flight tracks within the graphical interface, facilitating flight planning and performance calculations by providing accurate waypoint management and distance metrics.", "keywords": ["flight track", "waypoint", "Qt model", "table view", "delegate", "XML persistence", "distance calculation", "performance analysis", "meteorological software", "GUI"], "summary_hash": "e73ee4d3f7b0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:51:02+00:00"}
