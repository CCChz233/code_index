{"summary": "This module defines a fast test suite for the PixArtSigma diffusion pipeline that incorporates Prompt‑Aware Guidance (PAG). The tests verify that the pipeline components are correctly wired, that attention slicing works, that outputs have the expected format, that batch and single‑sample inference produce consistent results, that PAG layers can be enabled or disabled correctly, and that model checkpoints can be saved and reloaded without altering behavior.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the stability and correctness of the PixArtSigma PAG pipeline for production use, enabling developers to detect regressions early and ensure reliable image generation with prompt‑aware guidance.", "keywords": ["PixArtSigma", "Prompt-Aware Guidance", "pipeline testing", "fast tests", "attention slicing", "batch inference", "checkpoint saving", "model loading", "diffusion", "unit tests", "PyTorch", "Transformers"], "summary_hash": "9d9a06a15bdf", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:48:20+00:00"}
