{"summary": "This module implements the Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) framework using DGL and PyTorch. It defines components for encoding node features into latent embeddings, a discriminator that scores agreement between global and local representations, and a classifier for downstream tasks. The main model orchestrates these parts to learn unsupervised graph representations via mutual information maximization.", "business_intent": "Provide a reference implementation for unsupervised graph representation learning that can be leveraged to improve downstream node classification, clustering, or anomaly detection in graph-structured data.", "keywords": ["deep graph infomax", "graph neural network", "DGL", "PyTorch", "unsupervised learning", "node embeddings", "representation learning", "discriminator", "encoder"], "summary_hash": "7baf48af0e00", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:21:27+00:00"}
