{"summary": "Provides tools to generate ROMS boundary forcing files from external oceanographic datasets. The module reads configuration, loads source datasets (e.g., CESM, GLORYS), performs lateral and vertical regridding, interpolates variables onto the model grid, computes barotropic velocity, rotates velocity components, fills missing values, converts timestamps, and writes the processed data to NetCDF files, with optional diagnostic plots.", "business_intent": "Automate the preparation of realistic boundary condition inputs for the ROMS ocean model, reducing manual preprocessing effort and ensuring consistent, high‑quality forcing data for scientific simulations and operational forecasting.", "keywords": ["ROMS", "boundary forcing", "regridding", "vertical coordinate", "ocean model", "CESM", "GLORYS", "interpolation", "velocity rotation", "NetCDF", "data preprocessing", "oceanographic datasets"], "summary_hash": "afe4015536dc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:15:42+00:00"}
