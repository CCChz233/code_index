{"summary": "The module defines core graph neural network components built on DGL and PyTorch, including a differentiable pooling mechanism for batched graphs and an inductive neighbor-aggregation architecture. These layers compute node assignments, aggregate neighbor features, and produce hierarchical graph embeddings suitable for downstream graph learning tasks.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to incorporate advanced hierarchical graph representation learning, such as graph classification or clustering, into their applications by providing ready-to-use pooling and aggregation layers that work efficiently with batched graph data.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "DiffPool", "GraphSAGE", "DGL", "PyTorch", "hierarchical pooling", "node embeddings", "batched graphs", "graph representation learning", "neighbor aggregation"], "summary_hash": "a63cfbf689ef", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:33:28+00:00"}
