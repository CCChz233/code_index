{"summary": "Implements a Fractal task that performs image segmentation using the Cellpose deep‑learning model. The module loads image data (including ROI handling), normalizes channels, runs Cellpose inference, creates label images, builds multiscale pyramids, and writes the resulting segmentation and metadata to NGFF/Zarr stores.", "business_intent": "Automate high‑throughput cell or object segmentation in large microscopy datasets, integrating Cellpose into the Fractal pipeline to generate standardized label layers for downstream quantitative analysis.", "keywords": ["Cellpose", "image segmentation", "microscopy", "ROI processing", "multiscale pyramid", "NGFF", "Zarr", "label generation", "normalization", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "126a02ef8a80", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:56:37+00:00"}
