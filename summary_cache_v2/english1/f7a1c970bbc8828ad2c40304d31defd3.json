{"summary": "A test suite dedicated to verifying the YOLOS object‑detection model. It checks that the model can be instantiated from configuration and pretrained weights, produces correct attention and hidden‑state tensors, respects model‑specific settings (e.g., absence of input_ids, inputs_embeds, attention_mask, and sequence length), and functions properly for object‑detection tasks.", "business_intent": "Ensure the YOLOS implementation works as expected and remains stable across code changes by automatically validating its configuration, loading, forward‑pass outputs, and detection capabilities.", "keywords": ["YOLOS", "object detection", "model testing", "configuration validation", "pretrained loading", "attention outputs", "hidden states", "unit tests", "transformer", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "9b43b3fdb6f5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:01:51+00:00"}
