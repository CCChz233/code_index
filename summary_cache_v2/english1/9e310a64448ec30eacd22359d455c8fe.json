{"summary": "The module implements a multistep diffusion scheduler based on the DEIS algorithm, handling timestep configuration, noise addition, and stepwise sample updates for diffusion models. It integrates with Karras diffusion utilities and supports torch tensors for efficient inference.", "business_intent": "Enable faster and higher‑quality image generation in AI pipelines by providing an efficient deterministic sampling scheduler that reduces the number of inference steps required for diffusion models.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "DEIS", "multistep", "sampling", "inference acceleration", "torch", "Karras diffusion", "noise schedule", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "bd051c194b50", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:14:04+00:00"}
