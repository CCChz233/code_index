{"summary": "The script performs large‑scale automatic speech recognition inference by loading a NeMo ASR model and a prediction dataset, running transcription in parallel across multiple GPUs or nodes, and writing per‑GPU JSON prediction files that are later merged into a single results file. It supports both regular and tarred audio datasets, various model types (including hybrid CTC/RNNT), configurable trainer and dataloader settings, and optional calculation of word or character error rates.", "business_intent": "Enable high‑throughput, distributed speech‑to‑text transcription for bulk audio collections, facilitating services such as automated captioning, voice analytics, and large‑scale data labeling while leveraging GPU clusters for speed and scalability.", "keywords": ["ASR", "speech transcription", "parallel inference", "multi‑GPU", "multi‑node", "NeMo", "tarred dataset", "WER", "CER", "model checkpoint", "dataset configuration", "prediction aggregation"], "summary_hash": "5563ad117863", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:35:17+00:00"}
