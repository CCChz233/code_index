{"summary": "The module implements a canvas that aggregates and manages drawing elements for timeline visualizations. It stores drawings, applies visibility rules, binds abstract coordinates to concrete positions, enforces time‑range constraints, and respects configuration flags such as disabled bits or types. The canvas processes the data once and makes it available to different plotters, providing an iterator of uniquely keyed drawings that can be updated dynamically.", "business_intent": "To provide a flexible, reusable infrastructure for visualizing quantum program schedules, enabling multiple plotters to share processed drawing data and allowing users to adjust view parameters (e.g., time range) without rebuilding the entire visualization.", "keywords": ["timeline", "canvas", "drawing collection", "coordinate binding", "time range", "visualization", "quantum circuit", "schedule", "plotter", "stylesheet", "data processing"], "summary_hash": "404ad77d97a7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:03:31+00:00"}
