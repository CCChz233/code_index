{"summary": "A test suite that validates the integration of Lightning's ModelParallelStrategy with Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) version 2 and tensor parallelism. It defines helper models and functions to parallelize feed‑forward passes, then runs a series of tests covering model initialization, device mesh setup, checkpoint loading/saving, state‑dict handling, and edge cases such as modules without parameters.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that Lightning's model‑parallel training capabilities work correctly and reliably for large‑scale distributed training scenarios, enabling users to train massive models across multiple devices with proper checkpointing and state management.", "keywords": ["PyTorch Lightning", "model parallel", "FSDP2", "tensor parallel", "distributed training", "checkpointing", "state dict", "device mesh", "testing"], "summary_hash": "3eae7c05df67", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:33:21+00:00"}
