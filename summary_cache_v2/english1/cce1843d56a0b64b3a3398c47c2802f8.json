{"summary": "The package supplies a FastAPI service that forwards LLM completion calls through a Litellm Router and a set of scripts that generate concurrent requests to this service while profiling its memory consumption. It orchestrates asynchronous request execution, records memory usage over time, and helps assess the router’s scalability and potential memory leaks during load‑testing scenarios.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and operations teams to validate the performance and memory efficiency of the Litellm routing layer under realistic concurrent workloads, facilitating capacity planning and early detection of resource leaks.", "keywords": ["FastAPI", "Litellm Router", "load testing", "memory profiling", "async requests", "concurrency", "memory_profiler", "scalability", "performance testing", "HTTP client"], "summary_hash": "6f6f05af3d2b", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:02:21+00:00"}
