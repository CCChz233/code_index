{"summary": "The class observes a specified training or validation metric and automatically halts the training loop when the metric ceases to improve according to configurable criteria such as minimum change, patience count, finite checks, and absolute thresholds. It supports both minimization and maximization modes, validates metric availability, logs status, and can persist its internal state across sessions.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient model training by preventing unnecessary epochs once performance plateaus, thereby reducing over‑fitting risk, saving computational resources, and simplifying experiment management.", "keywords": ["early stopping", "metric monitoring", "patience", "minimum delta", "training termination", "validation metric", "thresholds", "PyTorch Lightning callback", "resource optimization", "model convergence"], "summary_hash": "44ce05949e88", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:13:33+00:00"}
