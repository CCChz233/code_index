{"summary": "The module implements ControlNet capabilities for the Flux transformer diffusion model, providing mechanisms to inject external conditioning signals into the attention layers, support gradient checkpointing, and manage attention processors. It also offers a wrapper to combine multiple ControlNet instances, enabling simultaneous use of several conditioning modalities during the denoising step.", "business_intent": "To enhance the Flux diffusion pipeline with precise, controllable image generation by allowing users to guide the model with additional inputs such as depth maps, sketches, or other modalities, and to support complex multi‑condition scenarios for creative and commercial content creation.", "keywords": ["ControlNet", "Flux", "transformer", "diffusion model", "conditional guidance", "attention processor", "gradient checkpointing", "multi‑control", "PyTorch", "inference"], "summary_hash": "e677c521cc5b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:31:26+00:00"}
