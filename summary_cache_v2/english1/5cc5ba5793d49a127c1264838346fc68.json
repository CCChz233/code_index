{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests that verify the behavior of the random cropping transform based on label classes. The tests cover correct handling of class indices, deterministic cropping with a fixed seed, proper interaction with lazy (pending) operations, and compatibility with different array types and MetaTensor metadata, ensuring that the output shapes and types are as expected.", "business_intent": "To guarantee reliable and accurate preprocessing of medical imaging data by validating the random label‑based cropping operation, thereby supporting robust model training and inference pipelines.", "keywords": ["random cropping", "label classes", "unit testing", "MONAI", "medical imaging", "lazy evaluation", "MetaTensor", "numpy", "parameterized tests", "shape validation"], "summary_hash": "cbfbb0994380", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:49:22+00:00"}
