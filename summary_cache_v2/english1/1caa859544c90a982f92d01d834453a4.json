{"summary": "A command‑line utility that performs large‑scale speech‑to‑text alignment using a K2‑based aligner. It loads a pretrained ASR model checkpoint, configures a prediction dataset (supporting both regular and tarred manifests), runs the alignment in parallel across multiple GPUs or nodes via PyTorch Lightning, and writes per‑process JSON results that are later merged into a single predictions file.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient, scalable generation of time‑aligned transcriptions for massive speech corpora, facilitating downstream tasks such as dataset preparation, quality assessment, and model training.", "keywords": ["speech alignment", "ASR", "K2", "multi‑GPU", "distributed processing", "tarred dataset", "JSON predictions", "model checkpoint", "parallel inference", "PyTorch Lightning"], "summary_hash": "36bd7fdda0a4", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:40:36+00:00"}
