{"summary": "The script implements a training and evaluation pipeline for a Gated Graph Sequence Neural Network (GGSNN) applied to the bAbI Path Finding task (task 19). It parses command‑line arguments, loads the bAbI dataset using a helper utility, constructs the GGSNN model, optimizes it with Adam, and reports performance on validation and test sets.", "business_intent": "Demonstrate how to train and test a graph‑based neural model on a reasoning benchmark, providing a reference implementation for sequence‑output tasks in the bAbI suite.", "keywords": ["training", "testing", "sequence output", "bAbI", "Path Finding", "GGSNN", "graph neural network", "PyTorch", "Adam optimizer", "data loading", "evaluation"], "summary_hash": "bc7de8ae6595", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:13:00+00:00"}
