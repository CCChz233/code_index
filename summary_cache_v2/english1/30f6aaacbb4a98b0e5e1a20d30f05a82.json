{"summary": "The module implements a set of benchmarks that generate quantum‑volume circuits, map them onto hardware using the SABRE swap algorithm, and record metrics such as transpilation runtime, circuit depth, and gate count. These tools are used to evaluate the quantum‑volume capability and mapping efficiency of IBM quantum backends.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to quantitatively assess the performance of quantum hardware and compilation pipelines, supporting hardware selection, optimization, and reporting of quantum‑volume related capabilities.", "keywords": ["quantum volume", "benchmark", "Qiskit", "SABRE swap", "transpilation", "circuit depth", "gate count", "performance measurement", "quantum backend", "hardware evaluation"], "summary_hash": "fdd1750a54ec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:35:11+00:00"}
