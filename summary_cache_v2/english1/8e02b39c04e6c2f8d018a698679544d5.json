{"summary": "Generates random parameters for applying a perspective warp to images, allowing control over distortion intensity and sampling strategy (basic inward corner translation or area‑preserving corner movement). It produces source and target corner coordinates as tensors, with configurable random‑number generation device and precision.", "business_intent": "Enables automated, stochastic perspective augmentation in computer‑vision pipelines to improve model robustness to geometric variations.", "keywords": ["perspective transformation", "data augmentation", "random distortion", "area preserving sampling", "tensor coordinates", "computer vision"], "summary_hash": "ae2ef1c49f59", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:57:47+00:00"}
