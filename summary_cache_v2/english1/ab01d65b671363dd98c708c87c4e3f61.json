{"summary": "A transpiler pass that examines a scheduled quantum circuit for idle intervals (delays) and inserts a configurable dynamical decoupling sequence into those gaps. The sequence acts as an identity operation, preserving logical functionality and global phase while reducing decoherence. The pass allows custom DD gate sets, per‑qubit selection, and adjustable spacing, with special handling for single‑gate sequences that can be absorbed into neighboring operations.", "business_intent": "Improve the fidelity of quantum programs by mitigating decoherence during idle periods without changing the intended computation.", "keywords": ["dynamical decoupling", "transpiler pass", "idle period padding", "delay mitigation", "quantum error mitigation", "circuit scheduling", "identity gate sequence", "Hahn echo", "Uhrig sequence", "qubit selection"], "summary_hash": "5850dc1fd8d1", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:31:26+00:00"}
