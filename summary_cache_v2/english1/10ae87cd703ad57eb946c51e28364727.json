{"summary": "The module defines data structures and validation logic for emulating AWS Route53 Domains resources. It includes models for domain records, name servers, contact details, and domain operations, each capable of validating their fields (such as domain names, TLDs, phone numbers, IP addresses) and converting to JSON for API responses. Helper utilities enable filtering and sorting of domain collections based on attributes like name and expiration date, and a custom exception signals validation failures.", "business_intent": "To provide a mock implementation of Route53 Domains validation and serialization, ensuring that test code can interact with domain‑related objects that behave like the real AWS service.", "keywords": ["Route53", "domain validation", "DNS", "name server", "contact detail", "operation status", "sorting", "filtering", "regex", "TLD support", "JSON serialization", "mock AWS"], "summary_hash": "81fce0efea01", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:51:18+00:00"}
