{"summary": "Test module that validates the Marigold normals generation pipeline. It provides a fast test suite using lightweight dummy components and a tiny autoencoder to check basic functionality and configuration handling, as well as an integration test suite that runs the full pipeline on different hardware targets and numeric precisions, covering parameters such as guidance scale, inference steps, batch size, and image resolution.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and stability of the Marigold normals pipeline across various environments and configurations, preventing regressions and ensuring reliable generation of normal maps for downstream computer vision and graphics applications.", "keywords": ["Marigold", "normals generation", "pipeline testing", "unit tests", "integration tests", "diffusers", "autoencoder", "UNet", "guidance scale", "inference steps", "batch size", "resolution", "GPU", "CPU", "float16", "float32", "determinism"], "summary_hash": "5711b429a2c0", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:54:12+00:00"}
