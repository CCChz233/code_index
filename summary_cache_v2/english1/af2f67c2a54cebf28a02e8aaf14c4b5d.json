{"summary": "This module defines a collection of neural network components for a graph‑based recommendation model. It includes a text feature extractor that builds a vocabulary and converts raw text into numeric vectors, a scorer that computes similarity between items, a linear projector that transforms and aggregates node features, a GraphSAGE encoder that generates node embeddings from graph data, and a weighted GraphSAGE convolution that incorporates edge weights during message passing.", "business_intent": "Provide the building blocks needed to train and serve a PinSAGE‑style recommendation system that leverages both textual content and graph structure to produce item embeddings and relevance scores for personalized recommendations.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "GraphSAGE", "weighted convolution", "recommendation system", "item similarity", "bag of words", "embedding", "PyTorch", "DGL"], "summary_hash": "8026343b5c50", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:17:51+00:00"}
