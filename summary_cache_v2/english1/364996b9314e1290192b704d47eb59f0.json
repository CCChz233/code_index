{"summary": "The module implements fast linear and multilinear interpolation on regular 1‑, 2‑ and 3‑dimensional grids, specially handling NaN nodata values by using an accumulator/divisor strategy. It computes per‑dimension weights and source indices, applies the appropriate interpolation routine, and provides Numba‑accelerated closures to be used by higher‑level regridding code.", "business_intent": "Provide a robust, high‑performance interpolation engine for scientific and geospatial datasets, enabling accurate regridding while correctly propagating missing data flags.", "keywords": ["linear interpolation", "multilinear", "regular grid", "Numba", "numpy", "xarray", "nodata handling", "NaN", "regridding", "multidimensional", "weights", "indices", "accumulator"], "summary_hash": "953075806739", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:45:53+00:00"}
