{"summary": "The module supplies utilities for transforming existing Dask task graphs, enabling operations such as attaching external data, preserving graph state, applying blockwise transformations, creating checkpoints, and cloning graph structures. These tools are intended for advanced manipulation of high‑level graphs rather than simple optimizations, and the resulting graphs may differ functionally from the originals.", "business_intent": "To give developers fine‑grained control over Dask computation graphs for building complex pipelines, supporting features like data binding, checkpointing for resilience, and graph cloning, thereby facilitating custom workflow orchestration and performance tuning.", "keywords": ["dask", "task graph", "graph transformation", "high‑level graph", "blockwise operation", "checkpointing", "data binding", "graph cloning", "pipeline orchestration", "graph state preservation"], "summary_hash": "b19a09f8e975", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:16:41+00:00"}
