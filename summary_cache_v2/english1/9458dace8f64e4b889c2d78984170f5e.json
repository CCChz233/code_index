{"summary": "This module contains unit tests that exercise the post‑processing utilities of the ivadomed library, such as hole filling, extracting the largest connected component, labeling based on coordinates, applying masks, and thresholding of segmentation volumes. The tests use common scientific Python packages (numpy, nibabel, scipy) and pytest fixtures to set up temporary data directories.", "business_intent": "Ensure that the post‑processing steps applied to medical image segmentation outputs are correct and robust, supporting reliable downstream analysis in clinical and research workflows.", "keywords": ["unit testing", "postprocessing", "medical imaging", "segmentation", "ivadomed", "hole filling", "largest component", "labeling", "masking", "thresholding", "numpy", "nibabel", "pytest"], "summary_hash": "de9685d64863", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:32:30+00:00"}
