{"summary": "This module defines a collection of unit tests that verify the correctness and stability of various 2‑dimensional UNet implementations used in diffusion models. The tests cover input preparation, shape handling, forward computation (including grouped normalization), loading of pretrained checkpoints from different sources, and consistency of inference outputs across configurations.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that UNet components for diffusion-based image generation are reliable, correctly integrated, and produce deterministic results, thereby supporting robust product development and research workflows.", "keywords": ["UNet", "2D", "diffusion", "unit testing", "model validation", "pretrained checkpoints", "shape verification", "forward pass", "grouped normalization", "latent diffusion", "deterministic", "torch"], "summary_hash": "c9cdbbffdfad", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T04:56:00+00:00"}
