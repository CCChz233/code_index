{"summary": "The module implements a DCGAN training pipeline accelerated with Lightning Fabric. It defines generator and discriminator neural networks, prepares the CelebA image dataset with transformations, initializes model weights, configures Fabric for optional distributed execution, and runs the adversarial training loop while periodically saving generated samples and model checkpoints.", "business_intent": "Offer a ready‑to‑run example that demonstrates how to train a deep convolutional generative adversarial network efficiently using Lightning Fabric, facilitating rapid development and scaling of image generation models for research or production use.", "keywords": ["DCGAN", "PyTorch", "Lightning Fabric", "generative adversarial network", "generator", "discriminator", "CelebA dataset", "distributed training", "image synthesis", "model checkpointing"], "summary_hash": "0fdae2b0f5cd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:51:26+00:00"}
