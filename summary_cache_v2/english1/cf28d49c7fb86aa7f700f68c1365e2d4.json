{"summary": "A test suite that validates the functionality for gathering, dividing, and merging operation blocks within quantum circuit DAG structures, covering both standard and dependency‑aware representations. It checks handling of conditional operations, measurements, classical arguments, registers, and block size constraints, ensuring the block processing behaves correctly across various scenarios.", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of block collection and splitting mechanisms used in quantum compilation, preventing regressions and confirming proper support for conditional gates, measurements, and classical resources in different DAG models.", "keywords": ["testing", "quantum circuit", "DAG", "block collection", "block splitting", "conditional gates", "measurements", "classical bits", "registers", "block size", "consolidation", "quantum compilation"], "summary_hash": "243bd3dc2d1e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:10:58+00:00"}
