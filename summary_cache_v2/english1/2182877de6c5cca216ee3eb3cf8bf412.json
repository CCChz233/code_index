{"summary": "A spatial transformation that extracts a region of interest from an image, allowing either a fixed size or a randomly sampled size within specified bounds, and positioning the crop at either a random location or the image center. It gracefully handles cases where the requested ROI exceeds the image dimensions and can operate in a lazy mode to defer actual data manipulation.", "business_intent": "Enable flexible image preprocessing and data augmentation for training and inference pipelines, especially in medical or computer‑vision contexts, by providing controlled random cropping while supporting lazy execution to improve performance.", "keywords": ["spatial cropping", "random ROI size", "center selection", "size constraints", "lazy execution", "image preprocessing", "data augmentation", "region of interest"], "summary_hash": "46b6e4bd06b7", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:03:08+00:00"}
