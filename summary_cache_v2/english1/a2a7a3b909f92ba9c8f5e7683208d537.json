{"summary": "A configurable component that drives auto‑regressive decoding of a Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN‑T) model. It combines the prediction (decoder) and joint networks with encoder outputs, applying the selected decoding strategy (greedy, beam, TSD, ALS‑D, etc.) and optionally producing token strings, alignments, timestamps and confidence metrics.", "business_intent": "Enable speech‑to‑text services to generate accurate transcriptions while offering rich metadata (timing, confidence, alignment) for downstream tasks such as subtitle creation, analytics, or quality assessment.", "keywords": ["RNN‑T", "decoding", "speech recognition", "beam search", "greedy decoding", "timestamps", "confidence scores", "alignments", "hypothesis generation", "configurable"], "summary_hash": "26518cc58505", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:32:24+00:00"}
