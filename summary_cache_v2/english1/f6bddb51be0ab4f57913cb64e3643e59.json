{"summary": "A lightweight mock optimizer that implements the essential optimizer interface without performing any computation. It provides no‑op implementations for parameter grouping, state handling, stepping, and gradient clearing, allowing the training framework to operate even when no real optimizer is configured.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless execution of the training pipeline when a user does not supply an optimizer, by supplying a dummy optimizer that satisfies the expected API and prevents errors.", "keywords": ["placeholder", "no‑op", "mock optimizer", "compatibility", "training loop", "state handling", "gradient reset", "Lightning"], "summary_hash": "0a6977fc3615", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:18:35+00:00"}
