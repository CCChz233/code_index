{"summary": "Provides a data structure that models a quantum circuit as a directed acyclic graph, where each wire is represented by edges linking input, output, and operation nodes. The class offers utilities to construct, query, and manipulate the circuit graph, enabling calculations of properties such as depth and width, as well as transformations like register management, sub‑circuit substitution, and operation reordering.", "business_intent": "Facilitates circuit analysis, optimization, and compilation within quantum software frameworks by exposing a graph‑based view of quantum programs, allowing developers and compilers to reason about dependencies, parallelism, and resource usage efficiently.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "directed acyclic graph", "DAG", "graph representation", "circuit depth", "circuit width", "register management", "operation substitution", "Qiskit", "circuit optimization", "graph transformation"], "summary_hash": "a6031ab3da2f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:51:31+00:00"}
