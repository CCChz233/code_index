{"summary": "Defines a Flax-based 2‑dimensional UNet architecture that can be conditioned on auxiliary data (e.g., text embeddings) for tasks such as diffusion‑based image generation. The class handles model construction, configuration parsing, and loading of pretrained weights.", "business_intent": "Enable developers to quickly integrate a pre‑trained or custom‑configured conditional UNet into Flax pipelines for image synthesis, reducing the effort required to build and train such models from scratch.", "keywords": ["Flax", "UNet", "2D", "conditional", "neural network", "diffusion", "pretrained", "configuration", "image generation", "model loading"], "summary_hash": "56a5917bbb53", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:39:55+00:00"}
