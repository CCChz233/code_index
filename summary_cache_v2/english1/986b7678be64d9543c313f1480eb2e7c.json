{"summary": "The module implements classes that translate coarse meteorological grids—such as evapotranspiration and precipitation—into the spatial framework of MetaSWAP SVAT cells. It performs nearest‑neighbour linking between the external data points and the model cells and writes the resulting mappings to the input files required for model coupling.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless integration of external climate datasets with the MetaSWAP soil‑vegetation‑atmosphere transfer model, improving the spatial accuracy of model forcing and supporting reliable hydrological simulations.", "keywords": ["meteorological data mapping", "nearest neighbor linking", "MetaSWAP", "SVAT cells", "evapotranspiration", "precipitation", "input file generation", "spatial coupling", "climate data integration"], "summary_hash": "c503d228584a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:43:59+00:00"}
