{"summary": "A test suite that validates that each complete example script fully incorporates the content of its corresponding feature‑by‑feature script, comparing them line by line and running the examples in both parser‑only and full‑training modes to pinpoint whether mismatches stem from the main entry point or the training loop. It also accounts for allowed differences such as logging or print variations.", "business_intent": "Ensure example documentation stays accurate and synchronized with feature implementations, providing reliable reference code for users and preventing regressions when examples are updated.", "keywords": ["script comparison", "example validation", "feature completeness", "parser only mode", "training loop verification", "testing", "discrepancy detection", "special string handling"], "summary_hash": "423a6b345497", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:04:52+00:00"}
