{"summary": "The module implements a collection of gradient‑based attribution techniques that compute saliency maps for deep learning models. It provides utilities to perform standard back‑propagation, guided back‑propagation, SmoothGrad, and a combination of guided back‑propagation with SmoothGrad, using custom ReLU operations to control gradient flow. These tools are integrated with model hooks to extract gradients for a selected output unit, facilitating visual explanation of model decisions.", "business_intent": "To give researchers and clinicians a transparent way to interpret neural network predictions, especially in medical imaging, by generating clear attribution visualizations that help diagnose model behavior, improve trust, and guide model refinement.", "keywords": ["gradient attribution", "saliency map", "guided backpropagation", "SmoothGrad", "vanilla gradient", "custom ReLU", "model hooks", "interpretability", "medical imaging", "PyTorch"], "summary_hash": "771c6240534f", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:08:20+00:00"}
