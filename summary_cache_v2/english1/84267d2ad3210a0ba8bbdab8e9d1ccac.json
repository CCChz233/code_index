{"summary": "The module provides a command‑line script that prepares a text‑image dataset, configures a Stable Diffusion model with a LoRA adapter, and runs a distributed training loop using Accelerate. It handles tokenization, preprocessing, scheduler setup, checkpoint saving, and optional model card creation and hub upload.", "business_intent": "Allow practitioners to efficiently fine‑tune Stable Diffusion for custom text‑to‑image generation using parameter‑efficient LoRA adapters, enabling tailored image synthesis for branding, content creation, or specialized visual domains.", "keywords": ["Stable Diffusion", "text-to-image", "fine-tuning", "LoRA", "parameter-efficient training", "Accelerate", "distributed training", "dataset preprocessing", "model checkpoint", "Hugging Face Hub", "diffusion scheduler"], "summary_hash": "5546eea8f31c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:08:22+00:00"}
