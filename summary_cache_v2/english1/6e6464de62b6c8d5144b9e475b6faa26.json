{"summary": "A command‑line utility that constructs a token‑level language model for ASR experiments using K2. It parses arguments, loads token vocabularies via NeMo tokenizers, invokes external language‑model building tools through subprocesses, and writes the resulting model files.", "business_intent": "Provide an automated way to generate token‑based language models for speech‑recognition pipelines, improving decoding accuracy and simplifying experiment setup.", "keywords": ["ASR", "token language model", "K2", "NeMo tokenizer", "subprocess", "command line", "language model generation", "speech recognition"], "summary_hash": "fa04a6fa2d77", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:40:32+00:00"}
