{"summary": "The routers package defines a collection of FastAPI routers that expose HTTP endpoints for managing the core resources of the platform, including applications, variants, environments, Docker containers, configurations, evaluations (both automated and human), test sets, user profiles, and health checks. Each router handles request validation, translates between database models and API schemas, and delegates business logic to underlying services such as persistence, Docker handling, and evaluation orchestration.", "business_intent": "Enable external clients and front‑end applications to interact with the backend system through a RESTful API, allowing creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of AI application components, deployment artifacts, and evaluation jobs, thereby supporting the full lifecycle of AI model development, testing, and monitoring.", "keywords": ["FastAPI", "router", "REST API", "CRUD", "application management", "variant management", "environment deployment", "Docker image handling", "configuration versioning", "automated evaluation", "human evaluation", "test set management", "user profile", "health check"], "summary_hash": "6b4bcbda5d88", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:29:56+00:00"}
