{"summary": "The module implements a comprehensive set of GPG‑related exception classes that model distinct failure scenarios such as malformed armor, missing or revoked keys, expired signatures, bad passphrases, and generic verification errors. It also provides helper utilities to obtain a signature from a source, interpret GPG command output, and invoke GPG for signature verification, centralising error handling for cryptographic validation of Ansible Galaxy collections.", "business_intent": "To guarantee the authenticity and integrity of Ansible Galaxy collections by offering robust GPG signature verification and detailed, structured error reporting that can be consumed by higher‑level Ansible components.", "keywords": ["GPG", "signature verification", "error handling", "Ansible Galaxy", "cryptography", "public key", "passphrase", "key expiration", "key revocation", "exception hierarchy"], "summary_hash": "09a0575597a6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T17:49:38+00:00"}
