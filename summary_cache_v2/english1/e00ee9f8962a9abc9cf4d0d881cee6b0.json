{"summary": "The module supplies core utility components for transformer‑based reinforcement learning workflows, including length sampling, device cache management, tensor seeding, statistical transformations of logits, probability and entropy calculations, and filtering mechanisms such as top‑k/top‑p. These helpers support efficient sampling, score normalization, and resource handling during policy optimization.", "business_intent": "Enable stable and efficient training of language models with reinforcement learning techniques by providing reusable low‑level operations for sampling, probability handling, and device memory management.", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "transformer", "sampling", "logits", "entropy", "top‑k", "top‑p", "whitening", "tensor utilities", "device cache", "seed setting"], "summary_hash": "279a8cd61700", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:57:11+00:00"}
