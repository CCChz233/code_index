{"summary": "This module contains a collection of pytest test cases and helper utilities that verify the functionality of the RiverForcing component of the ROMS tools package. The tests cover initialization with different data sources, handling of missing or malformed configurations, reproducibility of generated forcing files, data integrity checks such as file hash comparison, and auxiliary features like plotting, saving, and ensuring river locations align with coastlines.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that river forcing data used in ocean modeling workflows is correctly generated, reproducible, and robust against configuration errors, thereby supporting reliable simulation results for stakeholders relying on ROMS-based analyses.", "keywords": ["testing", "river forcing", "ROMS", "pytest", "climatology", "data integrity", "reproducibility", "yaml configuration", "grid handling", "dateline crossing", "hash verification", "error handling"], "summary_hash": "06624216cd02", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:16:15+00:00"}
