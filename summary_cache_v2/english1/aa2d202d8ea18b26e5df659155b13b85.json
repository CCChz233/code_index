{"summary": "A command‑line utility that loads a NeMo model, gathers all checkpoint (.ckpt) files located alongside the original .nemo archive, computes the element‑wise average of their weights, and writes a new averaged model file with a '-averaged.nemo' suffix. It can operate on a single model or be invoked in bulk via shell pipelines, and includes an option to supply additional import files for custom classes.", "business_intent": "Enable users to create averaged model checkpoints for NeMo models, improving model stability and performance through weight averaging while simplifying deployment and version management.", "keywords": ["checkpoint averaging", "NeMo", "model weights", "torch", "command line", "script", "model ensembling", "parameter averaging", "deployment", "logging"], "summary_hash": "a4b810cf574c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:48:14+00:00"}
