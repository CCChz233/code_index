{"summary": "The module defines a suite of unit tests for the high‑level well‑writing functionality of the MODFLOW‑6 interface. It includes a helper class that builds well data for both structured and unstructured grids, and uses various grid fixtures to verify configurable constraints, error handling for wells outside the model domain, uniqueness of well identifiers, filtering behavior, and the ability to generate well input directly from a model, including transient rate scenarios. A simple TWRI simulation helper is also provided.", "business_intent": "Validate and safeguard the correctness of well input generation for groundwater models using MODFLOW‑6, ensuring that configuration options, grid compatibility, identifier handling, and transient well behavior work reliably across different model setups.", "keywords": ["MODFLOW 6", "well writing", "unit testing", "grid structures", "structured grid", "unstructured grid", "constraints", "filtering", "transient rates", "simulation helper"], "summary_hash": "faaa9517c271", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T06:52:32+00:00"}
