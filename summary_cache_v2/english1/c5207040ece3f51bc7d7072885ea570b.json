{"summary": "The module defines a collection of generic class‑based views and mixins that simplify building date‑based archive pages in Django. It supplies abstract base classes for handling common date filtering, queryset ordering, and date range calculations, as well as concrete views for yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, and today archives, including index and detail pages. The mixins encapsulate reusable logic for extracting date components from URLs, computing adjacent periods, and formatting dates for templates.", "business_intent": "To provide developers with ready‑to‑use, configurable components that automatically retrieve and display model objects grouped by calendar dates, reducing the need to write custom query and view code for common archive patterns such as year, month, week, day, and today listings.", "keywords": ["Django", "generic class‑based views", "date archive", "year archive", "month archive", "week archive", "day archive", "today archive", "mixins", "date filtering", "queryset ordering", "template response"], "summary_hash": "e591f2045517", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:31:27+00:00"}
