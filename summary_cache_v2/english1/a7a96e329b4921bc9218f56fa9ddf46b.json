{"summary": "This module implements an end‑to‑end training pipeline for Faster‑RCNN object detection models using MXNet GluonCV. It provides utilities to load datasets, construct data loaders with appropriate transforms, configure learning‑rate schedules, execute forward and backward passes (including optional mixed‑precision), compute detection metrics, and periodically validate and checkpoint the model.", "business_intent": "To enable developers and researchers to train custom Faster‑RCNN detectors efficiently on COCO or VOC style datasets, facilitating experimentation with different backbones and hyper‑parameters for scene‑graph or object‑detection applications.", "keywords": ["Faster R-CNN", "MXNet", "GluonCV", "object detection", "training pipeline", "data loader", "learning rate schedule", "mixed precision", "COCO metric", "VOC metric", "parallel training", "custom backbone"], "summary_hash": "46802e33ebbb", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:10:35+00:00"}
