{"summary": "The VisualPrompter class encapsulates a SAM segmentation model, handling model loading, image preprocessing (normalization, resizing, padding), prompt transformation and validation, and executing inference for one or many visual prompts such as boxes, keypoints, or masks. It abstracts device and datatype configuration, allowing users to set an image once and obtain predictions for multiple queries efficiently.", "business_intent": "Provide a high‑level interface that simplifies running multiple visual prompt queries on a SAM segmentation model, managing preprocessing, validation, and inference to enable rapid prototyping and deployment of image segmentation workflows.", "keywords": ["visual prompting", "SAM segmentation", "image preprocessing", "prompt validation", "multi‑query inference", "device management", "dtype configuration", "model configuration", "segmentation logits"], "summary_hash": "25fb153a5a76", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T11:47:47+00:00"}
