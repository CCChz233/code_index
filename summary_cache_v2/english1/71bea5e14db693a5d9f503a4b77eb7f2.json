{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords list.\n\nWe must read file-level metadata: file_path ckan/model/user.py. The module defines user model for CKAN (Open-source data portal). Provides AnonymousUser and User classes, functions for last_active_check and set_api_key. So summary: module defines user domain object, handling authentication, password hashing, API key management, status, group membership, etc. Business intent: manage user accounts within CKAN, support login, permissions, API access, ensure security. Keywords: user, authentication, password, api key, activation, group membership, CKAN, model, database, security.\n\nMake sure not to list function names verbatim. So avoid \"last_active_check\" and \"set_api_key\"? The instruction: Do NOT list function names verbatim. So we should not include them in keywords.
