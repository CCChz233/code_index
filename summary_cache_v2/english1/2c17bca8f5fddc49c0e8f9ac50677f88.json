{"summary": "The test package validates core audio and speech‑processing utilities employed in an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. It includes comprehensive checks for audio segment handling, signal‑to‑distortion ratio computation, convolution matrix creation, decibel and RMS conversions, Toeplitz matrix generation, noise field synthesis, coherence estimation, channel selection, data simulation (annotation generation, alignment, CTM formatting, speech sampling with overlap and silence), and voice activity detection (frame labeling, segment extraction, VAD object construction, non‑speech interval detection, and RTTM parsing).", "business_intent": "Guarantee the correctness and robustness of the ASR utility library so that downstream speech recognition pipelines can rely on accurate audio preprocessing, simulated data generation, and reliable voice activity detection, ultimately improving model training and evaluation quality.", "keywords": ["audio processing", "speech recognition", "unit testing", "voice activity detection", "data simulation", "ASR utilities", "signal processing", "validation", "test suite", "audio utilities"], "summary_hash": "c219486340f5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:54:45+00:00"}
