{"summary": "Provides core components for building and operating Stable Diffusion text‑to‑image models, including a diffusion engine that handles data encoding/decoding, optimizer setup, EMA, logging, and sample generation, as well as a base diffusion model class that manages network execution, conditioning preparation, checkpoint tracking, and training initialization. Supports both standard and Megatron‑based distributed training.", "business_intent": "Enable researchers and developers to efficiently train, scale, and deploy Stable Diffusion models for generating images from textual prompts, with built‑in support for large‑scale distributed environments.", "keywords": ["stable diffusion", "text-to-image", "diffusion engine", "generative model", "training", "inference", "distributed training", "megatron", "EMA", "logging", "sample generation", "conditioning", "encoding", "decoding"], "summary_hash": "27e01c6c7ca9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:05:45+00:00"}
