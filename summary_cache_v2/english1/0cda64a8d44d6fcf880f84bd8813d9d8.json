{"summary": "The module implements an algorithm that constructs a quantum circuit of depth proportional to five times the number of qubits to realize a combined CZ‑CX transformation on a linear nearest‑neighbor architecture. It interprets the CZ layer as a symmetric binary matrix and the CX layer as an invertible binary matrix, computes the required inverses, and applies a depth‑5n optimization routine to produce a Qiskit QuantumCircuit.", "business_intent": "Provide a compilation primitive that efficiently maps arbitrary CZ and CX layers onto hardware with linear nearest‑neighbor connectivity, minimizing circuit depth for Clifford‑type operations and improving execution speed on near‑term quantum processors.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit synthesis", "CZ gate", "CX gate", "linear nearest neighbor", "depth optimization", "Clifford transformation", "matrix inversion", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "8f5e06373dd6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:58:00+00:00"}
