{"summary": "The module implements a training pipeline for a Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion (GCMC) model on the MovieLens dataset. It loads the full user‑item interaction graph on CPU, performs mini‑batch subgraph sampling, initializes the neural network, runs distributed or multi‑GPU training loops, computes loss and gradients, and logs performance metrics.", "business_intent": "To train and evaluate a graph‑based recommendation model that predicts user preferences for items, enabling improved recommendation accuracy on large-scale collaborative‑filtering data.", "keywords": ["GCMC", "graph neural network", "recommendation system", "MovieLens", "mini-batch sampling", "multi-GPU", "distributed training", "PyTorch", "DGL", "graph convolutional matrix completion"], "summary_hash": "ee72290a9358", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:19:21+00:00"}
