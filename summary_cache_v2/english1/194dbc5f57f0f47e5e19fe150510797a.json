{"summary": "Implements a backend that orchestrates a swarm of language‑model inference services for the Optimum benchmarking suite. It loads model configurations, prepares inputs, and executes text‑generation requests either individually or in batches using asynchronous calls to the LLMSwarm library and Hugging Face inference endpoints.", "business_intent": "Provide a scalable, multi‑model inference layer that allows users to benchmark and compare the performance of various LLM providers through a single, unified interface.", "keywords": ["LLM", "benchmarking", "asynchronous inference", "batch processing", "model loading", "LLMSwarm", "Hugging Face", "text generation", "backend", "configuration"], "summary_hash": "c2f361f3b4e7", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T02:31:16+00:00"}
