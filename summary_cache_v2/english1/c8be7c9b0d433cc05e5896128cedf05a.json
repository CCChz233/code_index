{"summary": "The test suite implements extensive pytest-based validation for the health simulation framework. It covers configuration fixtures, core simulation engine behavior, population dynamics, disease-specific modules (e.g., ALRI, cancer, malaria, HIV, TB, COPD, etc.), health‑system interactions, consumables, equipment, symptom management, analysis utilities, logging, progress display, and deterministic execution. Each test module isolates a component, creates dummy simulations, runs scenarios, and asserts expected outcomes such as event scheduling, treatment pathways, mortality, resource allocation, and data integrity.", "business_intent": "Provide automated verification that all parts of the health simulation platform function correctly, maintain model fidelity, detect regressions, and support reliable development and deployment of epidemiological and health‑system analyses.", "keywords": ["pytest", "health simulation", "disease modeling", "validation", "unit tests", "integration tests", "determinism", "population dynamics", "health system", "consumables", "logging", "analysis utilities", "scenario testing"], "summary_hash": "a73e937dcdb0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:01:33+00:00"}
