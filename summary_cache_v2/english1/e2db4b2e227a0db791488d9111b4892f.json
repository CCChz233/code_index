{"summary": "A neural network module that forms the decoding side of a SPADE‑style generator. It transforms latent style vectors and semantic label maps into high‑resolution images using a series of up‑sampling blocks with SPADE normalization, configurable channels, kernel sizes, and activation functions. The decoder can operate alone as a GAN generator or be paired with a matching encoder for VAE‑based image synthesis.", "business_intent": "Enable conditional image synthesis for applications such as virtual environment creation, content generation, and style‑controlled rendering by converting semantic layouts and optional style codes into realistic visual outputs.", "keywords": ["SPADE", "decoder", "conditional image generation", "semantic conditioning", "GAN", "VAE", "upsampling", "normalization", "style latent vector", "neural synthesis"], "summary_hash": "289eab6a8acc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:32:41+00:00"}
