{"summary": "A unit‑test module that verifies the RandGibbsNoised transform in MONAI. It creates synthetic 2‑D and 3‑D images, applies the transform under different probability and alpha settings, checks handling of dictionary inputs, confirms that the identity case leaves data unchanged, and validates deterministic reproducibility across runs.", "business_intent": "Guarantee that the random Gibbs noise augmentation works correctly and consistently for medical imaging pipelines, providing confidence that the transform behaves as expected under various configurations and supports reproducible experiments.", "keywords": ["RandGibbsNoised", "unit test", "probability handling", "alpha parameter", "dictionary input", "identity preservation", "reproducibility", "synthetic image", "MONAI", "deterministic"], "summary_hash": "b3f7e2dc8f3d", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:56:57+00:00"}
