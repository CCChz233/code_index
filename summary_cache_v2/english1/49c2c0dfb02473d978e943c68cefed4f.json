{"summary": "Provides utilities for managing Numba compatibility within the project, including checks for CPU and CUDA support, handling of strict compatibility mode, and a context manager to temporarily adjust strictness settings. It also offers a helper to conditionally skip CUDA-related tests when the required capabilities are unavailable.", "business_intent": "Enable safe and configurable use of Numba-accelerated code by detecting hardware and software support, allowing developers to enforce strict compatibility rules, and preventing execution of unsupported CUDA tests, thereby improving reliability and portability of the library.", "keywords": ["numba", "compatibility", "strictness", "cpu support", "cuda support", "fp16", "test skipping", "utility", "context manager", "configuration"], "summary_hash": "0f375e002447", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:40:44+00:00"}
