{"summary": "This module integrates Langchain’s tracing and generation mechanisms with the Chainlit UI. It provides helpers to accumulate streamed tokens for final answers, format generation data into JSON‑compatible structures, and a tracer implementation that records run lifecycles, maintains parent‑child relationships, captures errors, and forwards updates to Chainlit steps and messages.", "business_intent": "Allow developers to monitor, debug, and display Langchain execution flows and model outputs in real‑time within Chainlit applications, improving observability and user interaction with LLM-powered workflows.", "keywords": ["Langchain", "Chainlit", "tracing", "token streaming", "generation formatting", "observability", "run lifecycle", "parent‑child relationship", "JSON serialization", "real‑time UI updates"], "summary_hash": "d40b7f2c05c2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T05:31:03+00:00"}
