{"summary": "This module implements the MXNet backend for DGL's tensor abstraction, offering a suite of wrapper utilities that map MXNet ndarray functionality to DGL's expected tensor API. It covers tensor creation, data type handling, device placement, arithmetic, reductions, indexing, reshaping, and zero‑copy conversions, as well as a lightweight context manager to temporarily disable automatic gradient tracking.", "business_intent": "Provide DGL with a consistent, high‑performance interface to MXNet tensors, enabling graph neural network models to run on the MXNet platform while handling device management, gradient control, and seamless data interchange.", "keywords": ["MXNet", "DGL", "tensor backend", "ndarray wrapper", "gradient control", "device management", "zero‑copy conversion", "tensor operations", "graph neural networks"], "summary_hash": "3b39557835ed", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T00:41:57+00:00"}
