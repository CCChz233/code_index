{"summary": "This module implements the iSWAP quantum gate as a standard two‑qubit gate within Qiskit’s circuit library. It defines a singleton gate class that supplies the gate matrix, decomposition, and integration with quantum registers.", "business_intent": "Enable users to easily add and manipulate iSWAP operations in quantum circuits, providing a ready‑to‑use, efficiently decomposed gate for algorithm development and simulation.", "keywords": ["iSWAP", "quantum gate", "Qiskit", "two-qubit", "standard gate", "singleton", "XX+YY decomposition", "quantum circuit", "matrix representation"], "summary_hash": "e6849cd35e09", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:12:40+00:00"}
