{"summary": "This module contains a suite of unit tests that validate Dask's multiprocessing scheduler and related utilities. The tests cover custom process contexts, serialization and deserialization of tasks, handling of unpicklable objects, error propagation across processes, reproducibility with random seeds, remote exception handling, and interaction with high‑level graphs and process pools.", "business_intent": "To guarantee reliable and correct execution of Dask computations in a multiprocessing environment, ensuring that task pickling, custom contexts, error handling, and reproducibility behave as expected across different platforms and Python versions.", "keywords": ["Dask", "multiprocessing", "process pool", "serialization", "pickling", "custom context", "error propagation", "remote exception", "random seed", "high‑level graph", "unit testing"], "summary_hash": "65aef428f672", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:19:59+00:00"}
