{"summary": "This module defines a test suite that validates the integration of the Jedi type inference engine with Cython. It includes an AST visitor that extracts declaration nodes while respecting compiler directives, and a collection of unit tests that check Jedi's ability to infer correct types for functions, globals, collections, loops, and conflicting annotations, as well as tests for type injection during compilation.", "business_intent": "Guarantee reliable static type information for Cython code within IDEs and tooling that rely on Jedi, thereby enhancing developer productivity, code correctness, and the overall quality of the Cython development experience.", "keywords": ["Cython", "Jedi", "type inference", "unit testing", "AST traversal", "declaration extraction", "compiler directives", "type injection", "collections", "loops", "type annotations", "IDE integration"], "summary_hash": "6d1dfe726eb2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T21:25:35+00:00"}
