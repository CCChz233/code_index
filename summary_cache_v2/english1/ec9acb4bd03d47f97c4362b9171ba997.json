{"summary": "Implements a diffusion-based pipeline that converts textual prompts into animated video sequences. It orchestrates a variational autoencoder, a frozen CLIP text encoder, a tokenizer, a conditional UNet enhanced with a motion adapter, and a scheduler to encode, denoise, and decode latent video representations. The pipeline also integrates optional conditioning mechanisms such as textual inversion embeddings, LoRA weights, and IP adapters, and provides utilities for prompt encoding, latent preparation, classifier‑free guidance, and image/video decoding.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and content creators to generate high‑quality, controllable video content directly from natural language descriptions, supporting advanced customization through fine‑tuning modules and adapters.", "keywords": ["text-to-video", "diffusion pipeline", "latent video generation", "VAE", "CLIP text encoder", "UNet", "motion adapter", "scheduler", "LoRA", "textual inversion", "IP adapter", "classifier-free guidance", "control net"], "summary_hash": "df52cd4802b2", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T03:27:24+00:00"}
