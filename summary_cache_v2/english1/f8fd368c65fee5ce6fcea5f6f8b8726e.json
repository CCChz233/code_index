{"summary": "Provides a collection of helper utilities used by Qiskit’s circuit drawing back‑ends. It includes functions for extracting and organizing circuit instructions into layers, mapping qubits and classical bits to their registers, generating textual and LaTeX labels for gates, handling special characters, and formatting control and parameter information. A lightweight class is also supplied to manage a sequence of layer dictionaries, allowing insertion, shifting and presence checks.", "business_intent": "Enable accurate and flexible rendering of quantum circuits by supplying the underlying data‑processing and formatting logic required by visualisation tools such as text, matplotlib and LaTeX exporters.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit", "visualization", "layer extraction", "wire mapping", "label generation", "special character handling", "gate control formatting", "utility functions"], "summary_hash": "7ce615ff39d6", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:02:53+00:00"}
