It manages encoding of prompts with dual CLIP text encoders, prepares latent representations, runs a conditional UNet denoising loop guided by a scheduler, applies classifier‑free guidance, decodes latents via a VAE, and assembles the result as a video. It also integrates loading of additional model extensions (LoRA, IP‑Adapter, textual inversion) and handles device placement, safety checks, and interruption.\n\nBusiness intent: Provide developers and content creators with an easy‑to‑use API for generating high‑quality AI‑driven video from text, facilitating creative workflows, rapid prototyping, and integration into media production pipelines.\n\nKeywords list.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nMake sure JSON keys: summary, business_intent, keywords.\n\nLet's craft.\n\nassistantfinal{\n  \"summary\": \"The pipeline coordinates the components required to synthesize a video sequence from a textual prompt using the Stable Diffusion XL architecture.
