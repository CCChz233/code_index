{"summary": "This module implements a T5‑style transformer decoder enriched with Feature‑wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers. It provides self‑attention, cross‑attention, and configurable feed‑forward sub‑layers, all wrapped with layer normalization and dropout, to generate token logits that can be conditioned on external context vectors.", "business_intent": "To supply diffusion‑based pipelines with a conditional text generation component that can incorporate auxiliary signals (such as image embeddings or other modality features) into the decoding process, thereby improving controllability and relevance of generated text for downstream applications.", "keywords": ["transformer", "decoder", "FiLM", "conditional modulation", "self‑attention", "cross‑attention", "feed‑forward", "layer normalization", "diffusion models", "text generation", "conditioning"], "summary_hash": "7617ba2e3858", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:30:02+00:00"}
