{"summary": "A CouplingMap models the directed connectivity of physical qubits on a quantum device, where nodes are qubit indices and edges indicate allowed CNOT control‑target pairs. It offers graph‑style operations such as adding qubits and edges, querying neighbors, distances, connected components, symmetry checks, visualization, and utilities to generate common topologies (grid, line, ring, hexagonal, heavy‑hex, etc.) as well as reduction and shortest‑path calculations.", "business_intent": "Enables quantum compilers and routing algorithms to respect hardware coupling constraints when mapping logical circuits onto real devices, facilitating topology‑aware gate placement, circuit optimization, and validation of device connectivity.", "keywords": ["quantum coupling map", "directed graph", "CNOT connectivity", "qubit topology", "distance matrix", "connected components", "symmetry", "graph reduction", "routing", "quantum compiler"], "summary_hash": "e1179beb4698", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:07:56+00:00"}
