{"summary": "This module defines a diffusion scheduler that orchestrates the denoising steps of a probabilistic diffusion model, calculating the diffusion schedule, scaling factors, and noise injection for latent representations. It also provides a lightweight container for the denoised output used in successive sampling iterations. An auxiliary utility for beta computation is present but currently unused.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient training and inference of diffusion-based generative models by supplying a configurable scheduler that manages the diffusion timeline and state transitions, facilitating high‑quality image synthesis in the Wuerstchen framework.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "scheduler", "DDPM", "Wuerstchen", "denoising", "latent noise", "scaling factors", "PyTorch", "configuration", "generative AI"], "summary_hash": "61422b2ba489", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:13:00+00:00"}
