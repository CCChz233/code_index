{"summary": "The module implements a set of utilities for adapting image data distributions across domains. It provides generic transformer interfaces and concrete scalers (min‑max and standard) that can be fitted on reference data, applied to new images, and inverted. Additional functions perform histogram matching, cumulative distribution alignment, low‑frequency mutation, and Fourier‑domain manipulation to modify pixel statistics and frequency content for domain adaptation purposes.", "business_intent": "To supply preprocessing and augmentation tools that mitigate domain shift in computer‑vision pipelines, enabling models trained on one dataset to perform better on different but related datasets.", "keywords": ["domain adaptation", "image augmentation", "histogram matching", "frequency domain", "Fourier transform", "scaling", "normalization", "min‑max", "standardization", "pixel distribution", "low‑frequency mutation", "cumulative distribution function"], "summary_hash": "214a346059de", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T15:28:38+00:00"}
