{"summary": "A configuration container that encapsulates all architectural hyper‑parameters for a Donut Swin transformer model, such as image resolution, patch size, embedding dimensions, layer depths, attention heads, dropout rates, activation functions and positional embedding options. It inherits from a generic pretrained‑model config class, allowing the settings to be passed directly to the model constructor to create a fully defined Donut model.", "business_intent": "Provide a flexible, reproducible way for developers and researchers to specify and tweak the structural settings of a Donut document‑understanding model, enabling easy instantiation, sharing and fine‑tuning of models with custom vision transformer architectures.", "keywords": ["configuration", "transformer", "swin", "vision", "hyperparameters", "model architecture", "dropout", "attention", "embedding", "pretrained", "document understanding", "Donut"], "summary_hash": "a389b6579ec5", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T09:41:23+00:00"}
