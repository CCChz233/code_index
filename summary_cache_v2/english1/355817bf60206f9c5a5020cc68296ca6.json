{"summary": "The module defines configurable dense connectivity blocks for neural networks, allowing stacking of convolutional or residual units with customizable dimensions, channel sizes, dilations, kernel sizes, activations, normalizations, dropout, and bias. It implements the dense connection pattern where each layer receives the concatenated outputs of all previous layers, producing a combined feature map.", "business_intent": "Provide reusable, flexible building blocks for constructing deep learning models—particularly in medical imaging—by facilitating efficient feature reuse, improved gradient flow, and easy integration with PyTorch-based architectures.", "keywords": ["dense block", "convolutional unit", "residual unit", "feature concatenation", "configurable", "activation", "normalization", "dropout", "PyTorch", "MONAI"], "summary_hash": "8fa6779b1bd0", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:22:03+00:00"}
