{"summary": "We need to produce JSON with keys: summary, business_intent, keywords (list). Must not list method names verbatim. Focus on class responsibility and state/behavior. Provide English.\n\nClass: Blip2QFormerConfig. It's a configuration class for BLIP-2 Querying Transformer (Q-Former) model. Stores hyperparameters: vocab size, hidden size, layers, attention heads, etc. Inherits from PretrainedConfig. Used to instantiate model architecture. Business intent: enable developers to configure and instantiate BLIP-2 Q-Former models for multimodal tasks like image-text retrieval, captioning, etc. Provide keywords: configuration, transformer, Q-Former, BLIP-2, hyperparameters, pretrained, cross-attention, model architecture, NLP, vision-language.\n\nMake summary: This class encapsulates all architectural hyperparameters for a BLIP-2 Q-Former model, providing defaults matching the Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b checkpoint. It inherits from PretrainedConfig, allowing easy serialization and loading from pretrained weights. It defines vocab size, hidden dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, dropout rates, position embedding type, cross‑attention frequency, and other initialization settings, which are used when constructing the actual model.\n\nBusiness intent: Provide a flexible, reproducible way to configure and instantiate the Q‑Former component of BLIP‑2, facilitating research and deployment of vision‑language models that require a query transformer for image‑conditioned text generation or retrieval.\n\nKeywords list.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nMake sure no markdown.\n\nLet's craft.\n\n{\n  \"summary\": \"...\",\n  \"business_intent\": \"...\",\n  \"keywords\": [...]\n}\n\nLet's write.\n\nCheck length.\n\nOk.\n\nProceed.\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Encapsulates all architectural hyperparameters for a BLIP‑2 Querying Transformer (Q‑Former) model, inheriting from PretrainedConfig.
