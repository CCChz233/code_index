{"summary": "This module implements a Sphinx extension that provides the `automodapi` directive, a wrapper around the standard `automodule` directive. It adds advanced processing for module documentation, including automatic grouping of objects (modules, classes, exceptions, warnings, functions, variables, and custom groups), optional headings, configurable toctree generation, inheritance diagram support, and fine‑grained control over which members are displayed. The module also defines option handling logic and registers the directive with Sphinx during setup.", "business_intent": "To streamline the creation of consistent, well‑structured API reference documentation for Python packages by automating the collection, categorization, and rendering of module contents within Sphinx, reducing manual effort and ensuring uniform documentation across the project.", "keywords": ["Sphinx", "autodoc", "directive", "API documentation", "module grouping", "inheritance diagram", "toctree", "configuration", "Python", "documentation automation"], "summary_hash": "370ae48fd7a9", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:13:18+00:00"}
