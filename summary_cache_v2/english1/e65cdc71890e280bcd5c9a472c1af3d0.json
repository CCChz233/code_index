{"summary": "The file defines a Swin UNETR model for 3D medical image segmentation, which combines a Swin Transformer encoder with a UNet decoder. It includes implementations of Swin Transformer blocks, patch merging, and attention mechanisms, as well as the overall SwinUNETR architecture that integrates these components for segmentation tasks.", "business_intent": "Provide a state‑of‑the‑art deep learning model for 3‑D medical image segmentation, particularly for brain tumor segmentation in MRI scans, leveraging transformer‑based feature extraction and UNet‑style decoding.", "keywords": ["Swin UNETR", "3D medical image segmentation", "brain tumor segmentation", "MRI", "Swin Transformer", "UNet decoder", "patch merging", "window attention", "deep learning"], "summary_hash": "3a0583db985e", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:18:38+00:00"}
