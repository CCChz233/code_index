{"summary": "This module contains unit tests that verify the functionality of diffusion sampling inferers used with ControlNet and its latent variant. The tests cover multiple samplers, likelihood computation, statistical utilities, conditional generation, shape compatibility, and resampling behavior to ensure the inferers operate correctly under various scenarios.", "business_intent": "Ensure the reliability and correctness of ControlNet diffusion inference components within the MONAI framework, supporting robust generative modeling for medical imaging applications.", "keywords": ["ControlNet", "diffusion inference", "sampling", "likelihood", "latent diffusion", "unit testing", "MONAI", "generative models", "scheduler", "conditional generation", "shape validation"], "summary_hash": "eb453855e7bf", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:31:40+00:00"}
