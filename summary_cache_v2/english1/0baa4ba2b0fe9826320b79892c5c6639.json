{"summary": "Defines a class that models N‑qubit elements of the CNOT‑Dihedral group, storing each element as an invertible binary affine map together with a degree‑≤3 phase polynomial over Z₈. The class provides utilities to build instances from compatible quantum circuits, perform algebraic operations such as composition, tensoring and adjoint, and translate the abstract representation back into circuit, gate, matrix, or generic Operator forms for simulation and analysis within Qiskit.", "business_intent": "Enable precise representation and manipulation of CNOT‑Dihedral group operations in quantum software, facilitating circuit synthesis, verification, and simulation workflows that require algebraic handling of these specific Clifford‑plus‑T‑type gates.", "keywords": ["CNOT-Dihedral", "quantum operator", "affine transformation", "phase polynomial", "composition", "tensor product", "adjoint", "circuit conversion", "Qiskit", "quantum information", "simulation"], "summary_hash": "d54c6a45f1ab", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:08:10+00:00"}
