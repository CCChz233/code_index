{"summary": "The module provides a collection of unit‑test stubs that exercise the helper responsible for extracting no‑log (sensitive) values from list‑type parameters in Ansible modules. It defines simple argument‑spec and module‑parameter builders and contains several test cases that aim to verify correct detection of secret sub‑options, handling of invalid configurations, and behavior when no secrets are present.", "business_intent": "Validate that the Ansible parameter‑processing utility correctly identifies and masks sensitive entries within list parameters, thereby preventing secret data from being logged or exposed during module execution.", "keywords": ["ansible", "unit testing", "list parameters", "no_log", "sensitive data masking", "parameter validation", "security"], "summary_hash": "9f0c6b6f8555", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T18:22:06+00:00"}
