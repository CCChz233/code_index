{"summary": "A command‑line utility that trains a new textual‑inversion embedding for Stable Diffusion using bfloat16 precision and Intel‑optimized PyTorch. It prepares a custom dataset, configures Accelerate for distributed execution, runs the diffusion training loop, saves intermediate checkpoints, and can push the resulting model to the Hugging Face hub.", "business_intent": "Enable developers and researchers to efficiently create custom concept embeddings for Stable Diffusion on Intel hardware, reducing training time and resource usage while providing an easy workflow for model versioning and sharing.", "keywords": ["textual inversion", "Stable Diffusion", "bfloat16", "Intel extension for PyTorch", "Accelerate", "diffusers", "embedding training", "custom dataset", "checkpointing", "Hugging Face hub"], "summary_hash": "29c345754bee", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T05:07:54+00:00"}
