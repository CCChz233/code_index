{"summary": "The class encapsulates the workflow for applying a YOLO‑based object detection model to images. It manages model initialization, image preprocessing, inference execution, and post‑processing of detection results such as bounding‑box extraction and confidence filtering.", "business_intent": "Enable automated visual analysis of images for purposes like inventory tracking, security monitoring, quality inspection, or any scenario that requires fast and accurate object detection using YOLO models.", "keywords": ["YOLO", "object detection", "image preprocessing", "inference", "bounding boxes", "computer vision", "model loading", "post‑processing"], "summary_hash": "b61ee5898c2e", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T07:37:51+00:00"}
