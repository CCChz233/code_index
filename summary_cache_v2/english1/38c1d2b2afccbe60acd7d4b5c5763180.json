{"summary": "The module implements a neural front‑end that transforms raw video frames into compact, fixed‑dimensional feature vectors. It flattens spatial dimensions, optionally masks the lip region with a circular mask, and applies a linear projection. The output can be formatted in either channels‑first or channels‑last layout, making it suitable as a preprocessing block for multimodal speech‑visual models.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream speech‑visual applications such as lip‑reading, audiovisual speech recognition, and multimodal language understanding by providing a lightweight, configurable video feature extractor that integrates with NVIDIA NeMo pipelines.", "keywords": ["video feature extraction", "linear projection", "lip mask", "channels-first", "channels-last", "multimodal speech", "visual front‑end", "NeMo neural module", "speech‑visual models", "preprocessing"], "summary_hash": "0f40c32b2f0c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:59:14+00:00"}
