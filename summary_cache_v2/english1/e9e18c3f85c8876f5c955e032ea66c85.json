{"summary": "The scheduling package supplies a collection of Qiskit transpiler passes that assign execution times to operations in a circuit’s directed‑acyclic‑graph representation. It includes strategies for earliest‑possible (ASAP) and latest‑possible (ALAP) placement, an abstract base for concrete schedulers, a pass that inserts dynamical‑decoupling identity sequences into idle intervals, and a utility that normalises time units and annotates operation durations.", "business_intent": "To optimise quantum program execution on real hardware by organising gate timing, reducing idle periods, mitigating decoherence, and ensuring that circuit timing conforms to the target device’s specifications, thereby improving fidelity and overall performance.", "keywords": ["quantum circuit scheduling", "transpiler passes", "ASAP", "ALAP", "idle period detection", "dynamical decoupling", "time unit conversion", "DAG timing", "hardware constraints", "delay insertion"], "summary_hash": "94fe44ac3dbc", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:08:53+00:00"}
