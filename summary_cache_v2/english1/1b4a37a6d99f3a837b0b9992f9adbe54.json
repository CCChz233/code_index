{"summary": "The module supplies utilities for integrating VizTracer tracing with child processes. It defines a class that builds and runs an external command in a separate process while preserving tracing settings, and provides helper functions to patch multiprocessing and subprocess mechanisms so that forked or spawned processes inherit the tracing configuration.", "business_intent": "Allow applications using VizTracer to automatically trace code executed in subprocesses or multiprocessing workers, ensuring comprehensive performance and execution profiling across process boundaries.", "keywords": ["VizTracer", "tracing", "multiprocessing", "subprocess", "process spawning", "fork", "environment propagation", "command line construction", "instrumentation", "debugging"], "summary_hash": "03198ad0b0df", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:35:22+00:00"}
