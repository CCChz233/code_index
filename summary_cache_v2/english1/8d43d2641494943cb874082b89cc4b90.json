{"summary": "The script fine‑tunes a large causal language model (GPT‑J‑6B) with Proximal Policy Optimization to reduce toxic output. It loads a text dataset, tokenizes and filters it, sets up a toxicity classifier as a reward model, creates a reference model and a value‑head model, and runs a PPO training loop that updates the language model based on the classifier’s scores.", "business_intent": "Create a safer, less harmful AI text generation system by mitigating toxic language, supporting responsible deployment of large language models in products and services.", "keywords": ["GPT-J-6B", "Proximal Policy Optimization", "reinforcement learning from human feedback", "toxicity mitigation", "language model fine‑tuning", "reward model", "Roberta classifier", "dataset preprocessing", "tokenization", "TRL library", "transformers"], "summary_hash": "3d58562b6f04", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:02:19+00:00"}
