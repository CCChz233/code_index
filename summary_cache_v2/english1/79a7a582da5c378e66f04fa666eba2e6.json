{"summary": "A wrapper class for automatic speech recognition models that generates time-aligned transcription outputs. It abstracts model-specific details for CTC and RNNT architectures, handles probability suppression, token-to-word conversion, and formats results into CTM units, while also providing utilities for preparing training, validation, and test datasets.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream applications such as subtitle creation, speech analytics, and alignment‑based model training by delivering accurate word‑level timing information from ASR systems.", "keywords": ["ASR", "alignment", "CTC", "RNNT", "transcription", "time stamps", "CTM", "model wrapper", "speech-to-text", "data preparation"], "summary_hash": "9c16f121e8f5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T09:20:31+00:00"}
