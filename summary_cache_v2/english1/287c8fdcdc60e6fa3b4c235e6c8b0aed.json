{"summary": "The module provides a unified, provider‑agnostic interface for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting AI assistants, their conversation threads, and messages. It abstracts the specifics of supported back‑ends (e.g., OpenAI, Azure), offering both synchronous and asynchronous execution of assistant runs, while utility helpers validate inputs and manage optional features such as message augmentation and image generation.", "business_intent": "To simplify integration of conversational AI assistants into applications by handling cross‑provider details, thread and message lifecycle management, and run orchestration, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than low‑level API interactions.", "keywords": ["assistant management", "thread handling", "message handling", "provider abstraction", "OpenAI", "Azure", "synchronous execution", "asynchronous execution", "input validation", "configuration", "message augmentation", "image generation"], "summary_hash": "18e3395f9cdb", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T08:04:22+00:00"}
