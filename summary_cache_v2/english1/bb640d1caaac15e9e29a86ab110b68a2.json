{"summary": "The module contains a collection of unittest test suites that exercise different versions of the SMB protocol (SMB1, SMB2.1, SMB3) via the Impacket library. Each suite provides common setup logic and runs functional checks such as connection establishment, NetBIOS name resolution, Unicode handling, and dialect negotiation to validate protocol compliance and interoperability.", "business_intent": "To guarantee that SMB protocol implementations used for network file sharing are reliable, standards‑compliant, and interoperable across different environments, thereby reducing risk of connectivity or data‑handling issues in production deployments.", "keywords": ["SMB", "SMB1", "SMB2.1", "SMB3", "unit testing", "protocol compliance", "Impacket", "NetBIOS", "Unicode", "network file sharing", "dialect negotiation"], "summary_hash": "10a9449e9929", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:23:40+00:00"}
