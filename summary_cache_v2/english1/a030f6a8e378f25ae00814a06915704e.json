{"summary": "A command‑line utility that converts a multimodal instruction dataset (JSON + images) into a packed, indexed format suitable for training NeMo multimodal language models. It loads the data, tokenizes text, encodes images with a specified vision encoder, applies a configurable sequence‑packing algorithm to fit tokens and image embeddings within a maximum length, and writes the result to an indexed dataset directory.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient preparation of large multimodal training corpora for large language models by automating tokenization, image processing, and optimal sequence packing, thereby reducing training time and memory usage.", "keywords": ["multimodal dataset preprocessing", "tokenization", "image encoding", "sequence packing", "NeMo", "large language model", "indexed dataset", "command line interface", "first‑fit algorithm", "data preparation"], "summary_hash": "5d765969362c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:37:30+00:00"}
