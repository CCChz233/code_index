{"summary": "Provides a uniform‑random negative edge sampler for heterogeneous graphs. For each existing edge it attempts to generate up to *k* new source‑destination pairs by drawing source nodes uniformly from the source node type and destination nodes uniformly from the destination node type, while avoiding existing edges and optionally self‑loops. The sampler can operate with or without replacement and may return fewer than *k* samples when the graph is too small or dense.", "business_intent": "Enable training of graph‑based machine learning models, such as graph neural networks, by efficiently producing negative examples needed for contrastive or link‑prediction objectives.", "keywords": ["negative sampling", "uniform distribution", "graph edges", "heterogeneous graph", "source node type", "destination node type", "self‑loop exclusion", "sampling with replacement", "DGL", "graph neural network training"], "summary_hash": "a1c79322ef96", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T23:38:37+00:00"}
