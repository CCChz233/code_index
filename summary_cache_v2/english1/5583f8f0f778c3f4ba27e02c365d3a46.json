{"summary": "The module defines an asynchronous PrefectClient that encapsulates communication with the Prefect server's REST endpoints. It provides methods to create, read, update, and delete core orchestration objects such as flows, deployments, flow runs, task runs, block documents, concurrency limits, work pools, work queues, artifacts, and automations. It also includes utilities for health checks, server version discovery, and worker heartbeat signaling, leveraging httpx and ASGI lifespan management.", "business_intent": "To give Python applications a high‑level, async interface for managing Prefect orchestration resources programmatically, simplifying integration, automation, and testing of workflow deployments and runtime operations.", "keywords": ["Prefect", "async client", "REST API", "flows", "deployments", "flow runs", "task runs", "blocks", "concurrency limits", "work pools", "work queues", "artifacts", "automations", "health check", "worker heartbeat", "httpx", "ASGI"], "summary_hash": "b5aa50408e46", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:00:47+00:00"}
