{"summary": "The module defines a PyTorch-compatible dataset that reads Lhotse audio manifests and yields paired input and target audio tensors for audio-to-audio machine‑learning tasks. It handles channel selection, manifest conversion, and audio collation, providing the necessary indexing and loading logic for training or evaluating models such as speech enhancement or source separation.", "business_intent": "Facilitate the development and training of audio‑to‑audio neural models within the NeMo framework by offering a ready‑to‑use dataset that integrates Lhotse data structures and standard PyTorch data pipelines.", "keywords": ["Lhotse", "audio dataset", "audio-to-audio", "PyTorch", "channel selection", "speech enhancement", "source separation", "manifest processing", "collate", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "58d0327c29ac", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T11:08:52+00:00"}
