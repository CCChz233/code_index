{"summary": "This module implements a set of feature extractors for text‑to‑speech data preparation. It defines a generic featurizer interface and concrete implementations that compute mel‑spectrograms, energy contours, and pitch‑related signals from raw audio, handling batch collation, optional volume normalization, and persistent storage of the generated tensors.", "business_intent": "Enable efficient and reproducible preprocessing of audio recordings for TTS model training by automatically generating and caching acoustic features such as mel‑spectrograms, energy, and pitch.", "keywords": ["audio preprocessing", "mel spectrogram", "pitch extraction", "energy computation", "text-to-speech", "feature caching", "batch processing", "PyTorch", "librosa", "volume normalization"], "summary_hash": "f508be431a1c", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:58:16+00:00"}
