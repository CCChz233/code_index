{"summary": "The module provides utilities for converting raw quantum execution data into user‑friendly representations such as measurement counts, memory snapshots, statevectors, and unitary matrices. It includes helpers for binary/hex conversion, zero padding, and bitstring manipulation, and formats results according to the different result levels defined by Qiskit.", "business_intent": "Enable downstream analysis and visualization of quantum experiment outcomes by translating low‑level backend output into high‑level, interpretable formats for developers and researchers.", "keywords": ["post‑processing", "quantum measurement", "result formatting", "counts conversion", "statevector extraction", "unitary extraction", "binary to hex", "Qiskit"], "summary_hash": "8282901952fd", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T12:49:16+00:00"}
