{"summary": "The module defines a core utility that manages the lifecycle of instruction data for AI interactions. It receives raw instructions, simplifies or 'distills' them, wraps the results, assembles the appropriate arguments for OpenAI chat completion calls, and logs execution or usage information. Supporting helpers extract function signatures and assess return types, while various imports enable OpenAI client communication, Pydantic model handling, and type introspection.", "business_intent": "Enable seamless integration with OpenAI's chat completion service by automating the conversion of high‑level instruction objects into API‑ready request payloads, handling function call schemas, and providing usage tracking for downstream analytics.", "keywords": ["instruction processing", "OpenAI API integration", "chat completion", "payload preparation", "function call schema", "Pydantic models", "type introspection", "usage tracking", "distillation"], "summary_hash": "4a935d41df1c", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T06:32:38+00:00"}
