{"summary": "A configuration container that holds all hyperparameters and architectural settings required to build a DistilBERT transformer model, such as vocabulary size, number of layers, attention heads, hidden dimensions, dropout rates, and activation functions. The object can be passed to model constructors to create models with default or custom specifications and to retrieve the configuration from an existing model.", "business_intent": "Allow developers and researchers to easily define, modify, and share DistilBERT model configurations for various natural language processing applications, ensuring consistent model initialization, reproducibility, and compatibility with pretrained checkpoints.", "keywords": ["DistilBERT", "configuration", "hyperparameters", "transformer", "vocabulary size", "layers", "attention heads", "dropout", "activation", "initializer", "question answering", "sequence classification"], "summary_hash": "acebba25142b", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T08:22:20+00:00"}
