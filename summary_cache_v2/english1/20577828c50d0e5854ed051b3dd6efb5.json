{"summary": "Implements a PyTorch tensor subclass that carries an attached metadata dictionary (including affine matrices, spacing, and other image attributes). The class automatically propagates or shallow‑copies metadata during tensor operations, provides utilities to query batch status, and offers lazy attribute access to metadata fields, facilitating seamless integration of image metadata in MONAI workflows.", "business_intent": "Support medical imaging deep‑learning pipelines by preserving and managing spatial and contextual metadata alongside tensor data, ensuring that transformations, augmentations, and batch processing retain correct image geometry information.", "keywords": ["tensor subclass", "metadata propagation", "affine matrix", "image spacing", "medical imaging", "MONAI", "PyTorch", "batch handling", "lazy attributes", "spatial information"], "summary_hash": "b6a5cc3ecbb5", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T13:11:36+00:00"}
