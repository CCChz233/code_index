{"summary": "Command‑line application that runs ray‑tracing simulations for a specified telescope model to evaluate its optical performance. It computes point‑spread‑function D80, effective mirror area and effective focal length as functions of off‑axis angle, and generates corresponding plots.", "business_intent": "Provide a fast, automated way to validate and verify telescope optical designs against performance requirements, supporting design reviews and quality assurance for astronomical observatories.", "keywords": ["ray tracing", "optical validation", "PSF D80", "effective mirror area", "effective focal length", "off‑axis angle", "telescope model", "simulation", "performance plots", "command line"], "summary_hash": "83649a1a7f76", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T01:50:26+00:00"}
