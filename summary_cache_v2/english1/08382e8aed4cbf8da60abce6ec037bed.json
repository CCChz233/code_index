{"summary": "Provides a utility for computing cryptographic hashes within the intrinsic function evaluation framework of Step Functions. It selects a hash algorithm, processes argument lists, and integrates with the evaluation environment to produce hashed output for given input data.", "business_intent": "Support the intrinsic hash operation in AWS Step Functions, allowing state machine definitions to generate deterministic hash values for data handling, verification, or routing purposes.", "keywords": ["hash", "cryptographic algorithm", "intrinsic function", "Step Functions", "evaluation", "environment", "argument processing", "utility class"], "summary_hash": "32f9f4d649be", "cached_at": "2026-02-09T10:16:39+00:00"}
