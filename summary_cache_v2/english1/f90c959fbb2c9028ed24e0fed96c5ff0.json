{"summary": "The module defines a grid‑aware data container that extends xarray.DataArray by attaching an unstructured mesh description. It supplies mesh‑specific operations such as element‑wise slicing, gradient computation, integration, topological reductions, and interfaces for plotting, remapping, subsetting, and aggregation, thereby enabling seamless analysis of unstructured grid datasets within the xarray ecosystem.", "business_intent": "To equip scientists, engineers, and analysts working with unstructured mesh data (e.g., climate, ocean, and environmental models) with a high‑level, Pythonic toolset for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, accelerating research and decision‑making workflows.", "keywords": ["unstructured grid", "mesh-aware data array", "xarray extension", "gradient calculation", "integration", "element slicing", "topological reduction", "remapping", "subsetting", "aggregation", "plotting", "geospatial analysis", "scientific computing"], "summary_hash": "e546e5b25761", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T14:28:41+00:00"}
