{"summary": "The module defines a collection of differentiable loss components for training neural speech synthesis and audio codec models. It includes adversarial losses for generators and discriminators, masked regression losses, multi‑resolution spectral losses (mel‑spectrogram and STFT), feature‑matching losses, scale‑invariant SDR loss, and time‑domain losses, each with proper neural‑type specifications for integration into NeMo training pipelines.", "business_intent": "Provide researchers and developers with a comprehensive set of loss functions that improve audio quality, perceptual fidelity, and training stability for text‑to‑speech and audio compression systems, supporting adversarial training, variable‑length handling, and selective masking.", "keywords": ["audio loss", "speech synthesis", "neural codec", "adversarial training", "spectral loss", "time‑domain loss", "masked loss", "feature matching", "scale‑invariant SDR", "multi‑resolution", "PyTorch", "NeMo"], "summary_hash": "64fe1b9570ec", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T10:56:21+00:00"}
