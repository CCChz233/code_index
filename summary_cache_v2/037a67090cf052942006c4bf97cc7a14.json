It seems they want to output JSON for each standalone function summary? But there are no function summaries provided. The context only includes class summary. The user likely expects an empty output? The instruction: \"standalone_function_summaries:\" then blank, then \"JSON: { ... }\". Probably they want to output JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords for the file, as before. The previous answer already gave that. But now they ask for standalone function summaries, but none exist. So we should output JSON with empty list for functions? The format maybe: include \"standalone_function_summaries\": []? The instruction says \"JSON: { \"summary\": \"The function ...\", \"business_intent\": ..., \"keywords\": [...] }\". That seems like they want a JSON object for each function. Since none, maybe output empty array.\n\nThus respond with JSON containing \"standalone_function_summaries\": [].\n\nLet's produce:\n\n{\n  \"standalone_function_summaries\": []\n}\n\nBut also maybe include file-level summary?
