Both functions are currently not referenced elsewhere in the codebase and are not covered by tests, indicating they are either placeholders or unused utilities.", "business_intent": "The intended purpose of the module is to support a password‑based authentication flow within an end‑to‑end test scenario, handling the receipt of authentication data and initializing the chat environment for the user.", "keywords": ["Chainlit", "authentication", "callback", "chat initialization", "password auth", "e2e testing", "unused function", "placeholder"], "summary_hash": "a802a4bcd68a", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T04:18:07+00:00"}
