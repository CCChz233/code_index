{"summary": "Contains a collection of helper routines for handling model topography, such as reading bathymetry data, applying smoothing or regridding operations, and preparing the depth field for ROMS. The module is not referenced elsewhere and lacks test coverage, indicating it is currently isolated within the codebase.", "business_intent": "Provide a reusable set of functions to generate and process the ocean model’s bottom‑topography dataset, enabling users to create consistent bathymetry files that match the model grid and meet ROMS requirements.", "keywords": ["topography", "bathymetry", "regridding", "smoothing", "ROMS", "grid preparation", "unused", "standalone"], "summary_hash": "66282085e0c2", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T04:09:03+00:00"}
