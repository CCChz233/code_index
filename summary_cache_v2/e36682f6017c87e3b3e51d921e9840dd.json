{"summary": "{\n  \"summary\": \"...\"\n \nWe need to produce JSON with summary, business_intent, keywords.\n\nWe have class SlangParser. It has many parse_* methods for various language constructs: additive, assignment, block, cbuffer, else_if_statement, equality, export, expression, expression_statement, for_statement, function, function_call, function_call_or_identifier, global_variable, if_statement, import, logical_and, logical_or, member_access, multiplicative, parameters, primary, relational, return_statement, shader, statement, struct, typedef, unary, variable_declaration_or_assignment, vector_constructor, skip_comments, etc. Also eat, is_function, parse (maybe generic). So this is a parser for a language called Slang (maybe a shading language).
