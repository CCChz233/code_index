Based on file path health_router.py. It imports APIRouter, fastapi.status. There's a function health_check: Simple helper health_check. Likely defines router = APIRouter() and a GET endpoint /health that returns status 200. So summary: module defines health check endpoint for monitoring service availability. Business intent: provide a lightweight endpoint for external systems to verify that the backend service is up and running.
