{"summary": "The module contains performance‑focused tests that benchmark various group‑by operations on data structures. It runs a series of scenarios, measures execution time, and compares the results of legacy (deprecated) grouping logic against reference implementations to detect regressions and validate that the older code remains within acceptable speed limits.", "business_intent": "Validate and monitor the runtime characteristics of deprecated group‑by functionality to ensure it does not degrade performance, providing data that can guide maintenance decisions and potential deprecation timelines.", "keywords": ["performance", "benchmark", "groupby", "deprecated", "testing", "execution time", "regression detection", "pandas", "aggregation"], "summary_hash": "2fd994ea86aa", "cached_at": "2026-02-08T04:00:21+00:00"}
